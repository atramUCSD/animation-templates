0,Autos & Vehicles,2,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,r5tnzdZXMKs,"Let’s go back in time. ‘We’ve gone from main engine start, we have main engine start.” This was the future of cars in 1981, and when the DeLorean DMC-12 began production with gull-wing doors, gullwing as in gulls. Gullwing doors, doors in unpainted stainless steel panels, because paint is for cars that could never convincingly play a time machine, the future looked pretty great from every angle. And then on October 19, 1982, that timeline ended. I’ve got a spoiler: this is not a DeLorean. So, like a lot of people, I first heard about the DeLorean from Back to the Future. And this fictional version of the car was wildly popular. But then you find out that the real DeLorean failed less than two years after production began. How does that happen? Somehow it is still such a popular car that DeLorean clubs meet around the world just to talk about how great it is. I have a green light. The DeLorean story goes from Hill Valley in 1955, to Margaret Thatcher’s parliament, to war-torn Belfast, Ireland, to a very rainy parking lot near Washington, DC. That story goes a ton of places, even where I’m driving right now in this resoundingly mediocre vehicle. When you get into this story, it turns out that the DeLorean really is a time machine. “Are you, are you in it right now?” “I am in it right now, lemme see if I can flip the camera around. Right? I can do that, right? This entire car is 100% original. I like the DMC logo up there, that’s one thing that’s unique. The door ajar light has the gull wing on it.” “You have to brag about the gullwing door in the door ajar light.” The DeLorean’s many quirks are a collection of design choices and manufacturing irregularities. Legendary Italian designer Giorgetto Giugiaro created the design in 1974 and refined it through 1978. Early brainstorms for a mid-engine became a rear engine, and the stainless panels were smoothed out a bit. Lotus, via legendary racer and engineer Colin Chapman, provided the car’s engineering. The engine was a Renault V6. The gullwing doors were in the legacy of cars like the Bricklin, a failed gullwing indie car, as well as gullwings by Mercedes. Those gullwing doors required unusual adaptations, like a cryogenically twisted torsion bar and tiny windows - called tollbooth windows, because they were just large enough to pay a toll. But it actually wasn’t hard to get in and out of those gullwing doors. “Anybody watching this can see it on my YouTube channel, it’s just Geek Therapy Radio. And the myth is that gullwing doors, you can’t park in any parking lot because if someone parks too close to you, you’re trapped. Doors, as you see, hinge in the roof. So the doors go up more than they go out.” “Rejoice! Rejoice!” DeLorean fans are always debating about the car’s quality. If you say the engine is underpowered, they’ll say, well it wasn’t that underpowered for cars of the time. If you say it was heavy, they’ll say, ah well, look at these Porsches, they were actually heavier or the same weight. So the arguing? It’s a rite of passage if you are a DeLorean owner. “These guys are all awesome.” “Rejoice!” “Everytime I see someone post a picture of a DeLorean on Reddit, you go into the comments, and it’s usually people posting misinformation, other people ragging on the car for whatever reason, and then of course you get like one or two people, usually - sometimes me - who then start attacking, going no, here’s the real history, and it’s like, we’re arguing on the internet, who cares?” “And it’s Reddit!” “Right, and it’s Reddit. You like the car, you don’t like the car you don’t like the car, BFD.” So, whatever you think of the car, the DeLorean’s design was improbable. But its creation? That, that was almost impossible. “I remember having a conversation with John once when we were walking around the plant. I said to him, you know, what is it about the car, John, that is sacrosanct to you? He said, well, there are three things: stainless steel, gullwing doors, rear engine. You can do what you like with anything else. My name’s Barrie Wills. I was actually the first employee hired out of the UK car industry into DeLorean. I’d read about John, of course. He oozed charisma, he was charming, he was smart, and above all, he demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the auto industry.” We are here. It’s a liquor store. Cutty Sark Whiskey — the whiskey with a boat. I have this whiskey because John Z. DeLorean and his car were used in this ad to help sell it. He was that glamorous already. John DeLorean was a superstar. He started as an engineer. This 1958 patent - one of many - was for a slip drive transmission that he designed. But he found bigger roles. In 1964, he was considered instrumental in creating the Pontiac GTO. The car was young, and cool. It remade Pontiac’s reputation and made a reputation for John DeLorean. And by the 70s, he was in line to be President of General Motors. Being President of GM at that time was like being next in line to be king. Here’s a bump. But DeLorean was chafing at it. He thought it was too corrupt and he thought they were too square. He was a celebrity and he was a rebel. So he quit. But he had stayed long enough to make a reputation for himself. This is him in 1974, a year after he quit GM (critics, of course, said that he was fired). Long hair, cool shirt, a new look. He said he had surgery due to either an injury or a jawbone impact correction. Critics said was a makeover, the same way he madeover Pontiac. He also married his third wife, the internationally famous Cristina Ferrare, who he said he’d literally first seen in the pages of Vogue. He was the celebrity maverick who fired GM. And that gave him the mystique to take them on. Hope you’re enjoying that authentic turn signal sound. I’ve actually composed a song for later in this video. For when we hit our deepest emotional depth. It’s a sad song. I’m going to play it later. The new DeLorean Motor Company had glamorous investors like The Tonight Show’s Johnny Carson as well as a unique plan to get investments from car dealers. “This is a presentation of the DeLorean Motor Company. Our requirements are one: the dealer or his dealer associates must own $25,000 in DeLorean motor company common stock.” But a brand new factory and car required north of $100 million in investment. That meant government cash. There were a few potential timelines. Early flirtations with a Saudi Arabian investor and the state of Pennsylvania fizzled. A plan with Puerto Rico got further, offering a package close to $60 million if DeLorean raised $25 million first (and spent it first). But Northern Ireland, and therefore the UK, eventually paid up around $120 million, depending how you split loans, grants, and guarantees. The location of the factory? It was difficult. “It was 72 acres of...there were cattle on it. Half a mountain had to be relocated from outside Belfast to put enough footings onto the site to construct the buildings. Put the steel framework up, apart from the fact that two streams had to be diverted.” This was with an insanely fast 18 month time frame and an even more unstable political environment. All this was during “The Troubles,” the violent sectarian conflict in which Northern Ireland was fighting over whether they should be part of the Republic of Ireland or the UK. And this is why DeLorean got the money. The British government wanted to add stability and jobs to a violent, unemployment-plagued region. Barrie Wills says that it actually didn’t impact production that much, but riots did spill into the factory, and they had to consider stuff like hunger strikes in their production timeline. “As each hunger striker died, the Catholic, Republican workforce, would be called out for a day of mourning. The director of personnel was given a program by the Northern Ireland office of the likely death days of the hunger strikers so that we could plan ahead. Like, terrible.” Any other company would have let off the gas in this situation, but DeLorean did not have a choice. They were shipping 1,800 cars in October of 1981. They had to keep up with their funding obligations. Hire a large workforce, pay bonuses, make royalty payments. It was a lot. They pulled it all off really quickly. This DeLorean Motor Company infomercial shows the factory at work. But they needed constant cash to keep this going - from car sales or the British government. They needed perfection, but they got reality instead. Though the company had turned a slight profit by some measures, there were also almost 5,000 unsold cars by January of 1982. They were very pricey at $25,000, and they’d gotten a bad reputation. A 2,000 car recall and performance issues in the first batch didn’t help. “The first cars that were shipped out to the states were not good cars. We were under immense pressure. The government had made it clear that we weren’t going to get anymore money.” By February, 1982, DMC was in receivership - basically a forced bankruptcy. By May, production stopped. DeLorean had dipped back for money before, and the UK, led by conservative Margaret Thatcher, didn’t want to give more money to an American company. Rumors of fishy corporate structures, credible accusations of fraud, and possible millions in diverted money didn’t help make the sale. So all that had to have made it harder to raise cash in those last ditch efforts. Now DeLorean fans, they will tell you that the company failed because of the recession, and bad weather, and exchange rates, and they have a really good point — all that stuff hurt the company. But it might not have doomed the company had it not taken on so much risk, again and again. All those bets? Eventually DeLorean was going to lose one of them. And that was all before the flashiest scandal of all happened. In autumn, DeLorean was arrested for trying to raise money in an unusual way - agreeing to smuggle millions of dollars worth of cocaine. “It was horrific. I was told the night before that we all believed that John was raising the money. We didn’t know where it was coming from. I got a call hours before John’s arrest, to say, bring the workforce together tomorrow, I’m sorry Barrie, it’s all over, it’s liquidation.” DeLorean was eventually acquitted because of entrapment. He was never convicted of smuggling or fraud. So you have to make a judgment call. When you see this man, do you see a genius? Or an actor, playing a part? Maybe he was both. John Z. DeLorean, why did your car have to die? But your dream lives on. Let me show you why. Alright, so if you don’t know what Big Lots is, it got its store as an overstock store. Bargain bin place. And when DeLorean went bankrupt, the parent company of Big Lots actually bought all the DeLorean parts. We’re talking like, the literal stainless steel panels. And all those parts went into a warehouse. It looked like the end of the DeLorean story. And then a movie came out. What is the comment you get over and over again? “This is what makes time travel possible.” “After the movie, it was all about the flux capacitor.” “Flux capacitor.” “Where’s the flux capacitor? You know after a while you just get worn down and have to make a flux capacitor.” “Flux capacitor.” “Flux cap-” “McFly! McFly or Back to the Future. But usually it’s the McFly.” The car in the movie? It was a fantasy. It had to go 88 miles to travel in time, and the original DeLorean speedometer doesn’t go that high. They had to modify it for the movie. But little differences like that didn’t stop the DeLorean from becoming a time machine. After the movie, two communities developed in the vacuum left by DeLorean Motor Company’s failure. Today, there’s a strong international roster of companies able to service DeLoreans and supply factory original parts, even though they weren’t a part of the original company. And there are also clubs around the world where owners can support each other. “Right now I’m the president of the DeLorean Midatlantic club. We have about 80 members in the club right now. We do events 4 times a year.” One of Tiffany’s first events was a DeLorean MidAtlantic pigrimage to John Z. DeLorean’s mansion. But club events aren’t just about the past. They’ve made the car a platform for creativity. It’s a stainless steel Lego set. “Everybody has their level of modifications they like. For my own car I’ve actually done custom reupholstered seats. I’ve upgraded the exhaust to stainless steel exhaust that’s been from DeLorean Go in Europe. It sounds great.” “So at this point I’ve done fuel lines, the alternator, fuses and relays, radiator fans, the entire suspension at this point’s been upgraded. The car’s been lowered, new tires.” “We will share parts with each other. Like if someone’s working on something and we need something, I have extra DeLorean parts. So it’s kinda neat knowing that you have part of your car in someone else’s, living on.” “I made it and did all the programming and developed all the software and put it in my car."" This runs everything on the car. It gets data to the digital dash. “I mean, as most owners will tell you it’s never over. Well I of course had to upgrade that. That’s Lightning McQueen. He’s in for an overhaul. I doubled the voltage on and that’ll be ready for the spring.” There’s one clip in particular I really like. It’s of the Tri-State DeLorean club and they’re taking a picture with all their cars. Now look at them, look at how they rush to get out of the way. They are happy to give up the spotlight in a way that John Z. DeLorean never could. This car succeeded because it inspired people. Let’s end this video in the right car. “Perfect.” “All those people there, the thing that brings us together is this car, but they’re all really great people and I consider them all friends. It’s a good thing. I’ve reached the point in my life now where I really have to choose where I’m going to spend my time and the type of people I’m gonna be around. You’ve got to be really careful where you spend your time. You don’t want to waste it.” So thank you for riding with me today. If you want to check out a Cars and Coffee like the one I went to in the video, there might be one in your area, and there’s a lot of cool cars that people share there. Thank you also to the Tri-State DeLorean Club for letting me tag along. They were all awesome and incredibly nice. Thank you to Barrie Wills for sharing with me his stories. They’re detailed further in his book about his career with DeLorean. Finally, in our membership program the Video Lab, I am reviewing five or six of the top DeLorean books which I read for this piece and letting you know which you should check out and which ones you can go ahead and skip.

1,Music,10,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,62tIvfP9A2w,"This is John Coltrane’s Giant Steps. It’s considered one of the most important jazz albums of all time, it cemented John Coltrane as a legend among jazz saxophonists and composers, and it’s home to one of the most one of the most revered and feared compositions in jazz history. The reason why the album's title track is so iconic can be heard in its first few seconds. Coltrane wrote these unique chord changes for Giant Steps, and later went on to use them over traditional jazz standards. These chords came to be known as the Coltrane Changes -- and improvising over them is considered a rite of passage for jazz musicians. But, if you don’t understand a lick of music theory like me, it’s really hard to see how this is so legendary. Lucky for me, I know two people that can explain why… Braxton Cook Braxton: Okay you caught me off guard there! And Adam Neely Adam: Should I get into the, like, technical jargony stuff? Let’s cut to the logo first. So there’s a moment in the Giant Steps recording that really illustrates just how demanding this song is. It happens when Tommy Flanagan, the pianist on the record, starts his solo. Braxton: The story goes that John Coltrane brought in the music, he shows up ready to go and then calls he this really fast tempo. Adam: If you hear on the recording, Tommy Flanagan just cannot handle the chord progressions as they're going by. His improvisation is very halted. Braxton: And Tommy Flannagan's just holding on for dear life. It really becomes apparent how much he struggled, when you hear Coltrane take off at lightning speed the second Flanagan stops. Braxton: And then it goes down as like one of the most legendary recordings of all time. That’s messed up. I’d want another shot. I’d be like bro, don’t put that recording out. To understand why this was so difficult for even a highly trained pianist, we need to know three basic concepts and it all starts with this: the circle of fifths - it’s kind of like a color wheel for music. Braxton: Okay, awesome, you glued this stuff and everything. This is fire. All twelve notes of the western musical scale are on it, but you might notice they’re a little mixed up That’s because they’re organized by a very special number in music... a fifth. What’s a fifth? Braxton: It's like if you're in the C-major scale, you go  C, D, E, F, G - right? 1,2,3,4,5. From C to G is five notes, from G to D is five notes and… well you get the idea. If you play through the circle you’ll traverse the entire keyboard starting on the lowest C and ending up on the highest C. It sounds much more harmonious than just playing all the notes in order. That’s because... Adam: The fifth is a sound that our ears just like. Uh... please explain. Adam: Whenever we're hearing anything, whenever we're hearing people sing... Adam: Whenever we're hearing people play music, we're hearing these other notes, these overtones alongside the pitches that they're playing. When I play this C, the first two loudest tones that are pushed through the air are both C, one is just an octave higher. But other tones travel to our ears as well. The third loudest is a G, which happens to be a fifth above C. In 1973, Leonard Bernstein demonstrated this phenomenon live on a grand piano at Harvard. Listen closely after he hits that note. Bernstein: What do we hear now? That G, right? A new tone. Again, clear as a bell. You want to hear it again? Adam: These overtones are kind of like subliminal tones that you're hearing alongside a regular note. Adam: And you're hearing these overtones everywhere. A lot of western music is based on the power of the fifth, especially how it relates so strongly back to its home chord. Adam: In the case of the key of C major we have the G chord resolving to C. Adam: And if you’re thinking about what the G chord represents, it represents kind of tension. You want this to resolve. When it finally does resolve, Adam: it creates this feeling of finality, it creates a feeling of home. That five to one relationship is present in a lot of chord progressions, including the most common one found in jazz. The 2-5-1 Braxton:] The 2-5-1 essentially  is like the backbone of most jazz music. Even in its most basic form it sounds super jazzy. So it comes as no surprise the Coltrane Changes are just chock full of them. Which might raise the question: Why was Tommy Flanagan caught off guard when he had to improvise over them? Well, the Coltrane Changes aren’t in one key, they’re in three keys. They’re basically a musical MC Escher painting. So each one of these rungs on the circle of fifths represents every possible key center. The closer a key is to another, the more notes they have in common. Like the C major and G major scale - they’re only different by one note, an F#. Okay, we need an analogy to describe this. Adam: So the way that I like to think about keys is kind of like languages that you have to learn as a jazz improviser. You have to be able to be fluent in a key. Like maybe C is Spanish and G is Portuguese. Those are very similar languages. Adam: If that's the case, like okay maybe C is Spanish and you have a distantly related language like maybe Japanese. Let’s say Japanese is B. There’s not much in common with those two languages. And it’s the same with keys. If you play those scales over each other... It sounds a lot more discordant. Adam: For the most part, most pop music is based around one of these key centers. For instance, Carly Rae Jepsen's “Cut to the Feeling” is in A major. But some songs modulate to another key for dramatic effect. Like Beyonce’s “Love on Top.” Adam: Part of the reason why it's really exciting is because you're going to a place that's really distant on the circle of fifths. And you’re creating a new sense of home. Which is exactly what “Love on Top” does. But, it doesn’t just happen once, it happens every time she repeats the chorus towards the end of the song. Adam: And when you chart that sort of thing along the circle of fifths, patterns emerge. These types of patterns are what fascinated John Coltrane in the late 1950s and '60s as he was trying to push jazz harmony to its limits. This is his study of the circle of fifths. Braxton: I think what makes Giant Steps really special is that it really just, it just documented an artist doing something super unique, super stylistic, and virtuosic at the same time. Here’s the first 16 bars of Giant Steps again, with just the key changes highlighted. If you chart those changes on the circle of fifths it comes out as a pretty dramatic pattern. That’s because these keys are separated by major thirds, which divide an octave into 3 equal parts. On the circle of fifths these three keys are as far apart as possible from each other. Adam: Giant Steps is kind of like you're shifting from Spanish to Arabic to Japanese very quickly. By quickly, he means like every two beats in a song that’s nearly 300 bpm. Adam: It's not only just like you're saying one word per language, you're having to construct a sentence out of the language. And how does Coltrane make those disparate languages connect? With one of the most ubiquitous phrases in jazz, the five one. Adam: What he's doing is taking some of the conventional ideas of tonal harmony, the conventional relationships between the five chord and the one chord and applying it to this very chaotic circling, sort of chord progression that is the Coltrane Changes. Adam: So if we were all in the same key, it would sound like this. Adam: But because we're going from key center to key center, it sounds very different. This is why the Coltrane Changes are like this picture here. Even though you’re seeing things from a completely new perspective you still feel like you’ve made it home somehow. When Tommy Flanagan saw the charts for Giant Steps he knew he wasn’t going to just have to play this chord progression - he was going to have to improvise over it. very quickly. Braxton: That was probably so funny, he was probably like, ""What?!"" Adam: It is a bit of a rite of passage to say that you not only can improvise on Giant Steps, but you can also improvise in all 12 keys. Adam: Now, generations of jazz musicians are approaching Giant Steps as the sort of pinnacle of improvisation. Wait. I think I’ve got an analogy for this. It’s like you’re a cab driver and instead of only knowing one way to get somewhere, you have to know every back alley and side street just in case. Braxton: It's essentially like that. You still get to the same location, but it’s really interesting and you might see some really cool stuff in the neighborhood. Braxton: But ultimately I still think the music boils down to 5 1. People want to come back home. Thanks so much for watching the first of three videos I'm going to release in the next couple of weeks on Jazz. I want to give a special thanks to Braxton Cook and Adam Neely. Between the time that I interviewed Braxton and now, he's released a full album. Please check it out below and of course special, special thanks to Adam Neely. You can check out his YouTube channel below. Until next time! "
2,Music,10,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,KNgA7dDs90E,"This is a little piece of jazz history and it's one of the coolest things I've ever held. It's three cropped photos held together with scotch tape and a note dictating how to print the negatives for the final photos. The remarkable thing about this post-it note-sized image, is how little it changed when it became the full album cover for jazz saxophonist Joe Henderson's 1966 classic ""Mode for Joe."" The story of how this became this didn't start in 1966. It started in 1939, when two Jewish-German immigrants, Francis Wolff and Alfred Lion, started the Blue Note jazz label in New York City that would come to be revered not only for its sound, but for its iconic album covers. What they were going for is, they wanted to make tunes that were memorable, that people could walk out of a club humming, and that had a certain amount of soul to them. That's Michael Cuscuna, a record producer and Blue Note aficionado. That soul sound Michael's describing was called Hard Bop, a genre of jazz steeped in Gospel and Rhythm &amp; Blues that became synonymous with Blue Note by the mid-1950s. The  mastermind behind the sound was recording engineer Rudy Van Gelder. ""I'm not standing too close when we play the ensemble am I? You want me to articulate my solo? Yeah, you're a little too close. Yeah well I'll step back a little bit. Is that it? Uh, this is take four. When you heard a Blue Note record, you heard a lot of air coming through the saxophones and the trumpets. And you heard all the power and crystal details of the drums. That description is fully evident in Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers' ""The Drum Thunder Suite."" That was kind of the classic time for modern jazz and New York was heaven on Earth. There was a record store on every other block, throughout all of, not midtown, but also the Village and Harlem. And, if you went to those record stores, it probably wasn't the sound of Blue Note that immediately caught your attention — it was their album covers. Their bold use of color, intimate photography, and meticulous placed typography came to define the look of jazz during the 1950s and '60s. These covers are energetic, moody, and they're sophisticated. These album covers are jazz. Now, if you flip a Blue Note record over, it's likely you'll see two names credited for its look. Cover Photo, Francis Wolff, Cover Design, Reid Miles. Francis Wolff started shooting every Blue Note session the minute he arrived. One of the most impressive and kind of shocking things was that the average success rate of those photos was really extraordinary. He's like the jazz artist of photography in the sense that he could nail it immediately. But the person who decided that this photo would be this cover, was graphic designer Reid Miles. He could look at a contact sheet and zero in on one image that you or I might not even think twice about, and find a little crop of a square that would be like, wow, that's a dynamite image. Yeah, that is dynamite. One of the things that amazed me was what I call the ""pullback effect."" Take Hank Mobley's ""No Room for Squares."" There was a new subway station that was built, it was unlike any other subway stop. It had these metal concentric circles. Now, try to find the final album cover. There it is. The pullback shows you the whole image and it shows you an insight into the eye of the designer, that I think is absolutely amazing. This is Lee Morgan's ""Search for the New Land."" What was really going on was, Lee was listening to the music and sitting next to him is Alfred Lion with his eyes closed in a reverie. Listening to the same music. By the 1960s, Reid became more and more adventurous in how he'd use typography, sometimes omitting photos altogether. This is Joe Henderson's 1964 album, ""In'n Out."" A tiny crop of a photo of Henderson plays a supporting role to a bold and energetic design, with those arrows driving the feeling of the album title home. There's a Jackie McClean album called ""It's Time."" There's that tiny crop of a photo again. And then, just exclamation points for the rest of this cover. Black type on white. And it's just startlingly beautiful and startlingly getting your attention. But some of my favorite covers are the ones where Reid uses Wolff's photography as a playground for typography. If you look at the contact sheet of ""Uno Mas,"" the upper-right hand shot is the one that Reid Miles focused on. That would probably be one of the least memorable images on a contact sheet. There's photos of Herbie Hancock and Joe Henderson. And also there's two shots of Tony Williams who, in this photo, looks 17 years old. And who is 17 years old. But Reid chose this image and perfectly placed the title of the album right in Kenny Dorham's hand. He did this with Freddie Roach's ""Good Move!"" And fit ""Our Man in Paris"" around Dexter Gordon's cigarette. What always amazed me about art directors was the ones that could create a look for a record that was highly individual, but also that fit into a stream that gave the label a look. Reid Miles was a master of that. "
3,Music,10,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,v9gLmBgUTV4,"On September 19, 1985, a congressional hearing about rock music lyrics captured the nation's attention. Over the course of 5 hours, a music expert, a reverend, a group of parents, and quite a few deeply horrified politicians publicly reprimanded the music industry for their lack of morals. This is Democratic Sen. Fritz Hollings Hollings: But in all candor, I would tell you it’s outrageous filth. If I could find some way, constitutionally, to do away with it, I would. The leader of this charge was the Parents Music Resource Center or PMRC, a group led by the wives of a few washington politicians. And what started out as a dialogue about explicit lyrics — Susan Baker: Cole Porter’s ""The Bird’s Do It, The Bees Do It” can hardly be compared with WASP’s “I F-U-C-K Like a Beast” — turned into an all out attack on how rock stars portrayed themselves to kids. From music videos and album covers to the names of fan clubs. Al Gore: Mr. Snider, what is the name of your fan club? Snider: The fan club is called the SMF Friends of Twisted Sister Al Gore: And what does SMF stand for when it’s spelled out?” Dee Snider: It stands for the Sick Mother Fucking Friends of Twisted Sister. Al Gore: Is this also a Christian group? Snider: I don’t believe that profanity has anything to do with Christianity. Three musicians, Frank Zappa, John Denver, and Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, defended their music citing the importance of free speech. Denver: Discipline and self-restraint when practiced by an individual, a family, or a company is an effective way to deal with this issue. The same thing when forced on a people by their government. Or worse by a self-appointed watchdog of public morals, is supression, and will not be tolerated in democratic society. That five-hour-long hearing wasn’t an isolated incident, it was just one moment in the war on rock music that had been infiltrating American culture and politics for years. It was that war that gave us this sticker, one we pretty much take for granted today. Stuessy: Given the American philosophy, I think we’ve given the so-called creative artists a wide berth. Somehow we must send a message to the recording and radio industry: enough is enough you’ve you've gone too far. In the words of the heavy metal band Twisted Sister, we’re not going to take it anymore. Tipper Gore: I bought the Purple Rain album for our 11-year old. This is Tipper Gore, she was a very vocal leader of the PMRC. I felt that it was inappropriate for her and her 8- and 6-year-old sister to hear a song describing a girl masturbating in a hotel lobby with a magazine. Prince: I knew a girl named Nikki, I guess you could say she was a sex fiend. I met her in a hotel lobby masturbating with a magazine. Eric: So to recap, she bought this album Sight Unseen. The lyrics were printed on the album. It was a soundtrack to an R-rated film, and she played this for her children without any previewing of it whatsoever. Tipper doesn't blame herself. She doesn't blame her daughter. She blames Prince. This situation was Prince's fault. Prince’s “Darling Nikki” ended up on the PMRCs “Filthy Fifteen,"" a list of songs they felt represented the most explicit music of 1985. Eric: Subject matter might contain one to four different objections. One was things that were violent, or in some cases may have even encouraged acts of violence. There was sexual references. There was drug and alcohol references in songs. Take a close look at this list and you’ll see one genre disproportionately called out. Heavy Metal. And a fourth rating, an “O” For the Occult. Rockstars have always been accused of being a cohort of the devil. The legendary story of blues guitarist Robert Johnson’s career is that he sold his soul to the devil so he could play better. That was in 1937. When the Blues became Rock and Roll, that mythology became a full on aesthetic. From the Beatles featuring Aleister Crowley, a known occultist, on St. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, to the Rolling Stones upping the ante with an album called Their Satanic Majesties Request. But it wasn’t until Rock and Roll birthed Heavy Metal that Satan and the occult became a central character in popular music. Black Sabbath, are widely considered the original Heavy Metal band. They released their first album in 1970 and it featured a figure in black on the front cover. That gloomy aesthetic extends to the very first track which opens with a giant crash of thunder and ominous church bells. ""Oh no, no, please God help me."" After this album, bands all over started popping up, building on the sound and the style. Even hard rock acts like AC/DC referenced Hell and Satan as signs of rebellion. ""Hey Satan. Payin' my dues."" ""Playing in a rocking band."" By the 1980s heavy metal was mainstream and On one end there was highly melodic and commercial bands like Motley Crue and Def Leppard, on the other end, darker, more intense groups like Mercyful Fate and Slayer. Across this spectrum, though, remained a very clear aesthetic: albums with gothic typefaces and visual and lyrical references to the occult, Hell, evil, and violence. Jason: You should look up their version of Suicidal Tendencies' “Institutionalized” you will love it, you’ll love it. They also have another song called... That’s Jason Kalfin, he was and still is a heavy metal fan. Jason: Ah what is it? Talk Shit Get Shot? It’s a classic. He’s talking about Ice-T’s heavy metal band Body Count, but I digress. In 1981, with the launch of MTV, music videos became a part of the daily TV diet of kids across the US. But it wasn’t all kids, it was mostly white teenage boys who were MTV’s core demographic, because most of the communities wired for cable were in suburban, largely white, neighborhoods. Jason: One minute you had a Metallica video and then the next minute you had a Culture Club video, or Wham! Or Motley Crue. When heavy metal came on you could pretty much count on it being incredibly outlandish. Eric: At the same time that this is happening, there is this cultural movement happening in the United States. Gary Greenwald: If you’re into rock and roll today, let me warn you. Eric: Of people who would tour around Evangelical churches and basically scare the shit out of the parishioners by telling them that Satan was controlling the entertainment industry. Greenwald: Satan is using the rock groups as his patsies to evangelize the youth of the world! That fringe group quickly morphed into a wave of televangelists ripping rock music, even Christian rock, apart in front of a national audience. Jimmy Swaggart: One young man with an earring in his ear, and his hair down to his back, singing rock music, says his pastor told him to do that, it'll win the kids. To the growing religious right, all of pop culture was just hell on earth. Everything from the game Dungeons and Dragons to this Proctor and Gamble logo were under scrutiny. But it was rock music and heavy metal in particular that seemed to get the most attention. It seemed to be the crazier their claims were, the more bookings they got. So it became a financial incentive for them to make these ludicrous claims about the music industry. Like the Truth About Rock Seminar by The Peters Brothers. Are you ready for Truth about Rock? The Peters Brothers’ seminars and bonfires have drawn press attention from coast to coast. Here they are outside a KISS concert. When I see the way these people are encouraging kids to live, there is no doubt in my mind, we have got be more militant in our own sand, Steve.” There was literally a feature length movie called ""Rock It’s Your Decision"" about a kid named Jeff struggling to choose between listening to his favorite music and God. Kid: When I went through my own record collection I was shocked! Isn’t sex a major theme? And the occult too? And what about the lifestyles of the popular groups and artists? Some are admitted homosexuals! Spoiler alert, he chooses God. There were rock record burnings across the country. Jason: Gene Simmons from KISS said it best one time, he was like if you don’t like my record go out and buy 1,000 copies and burn it. Just keep buying them. Bands like AC/DC and KISS even had to prove their names weren’t acronyms for satanic worship. Eric: Kiss, that's all it stands for. However they’d say “no, no, no, that stands for Knights in Satan's Service” We need to talk about KISS, does their name really stand for Knights in Service to Satan? Eric: KISS were clowns. They were ridiculous people who did ridiculous bombastic big huge things. They were not in league with Satan. Not surprisingly, the craziest claims were the ones that traveled the furthest. One of them was backmasking. Eric: The idea was that there were things you could hear when you were playing the record backwards, that somehow when you listen to it forward your brain could still hear the message flip it around, decode it. It wasn’t just the record covers or the written lyrics, these evangelists believed rock music was a breeding ground for satanic subliminal messages. ""Backward Masking Unmasked"" was a book written about subliminal messages in rock music. It was sold in churches across the country. One of the most legendary and famous allegations was that Led Zeppelin’s ""Stairway to Heaven"" played backwards said “My Sweet Satan” I’m going to fast forward now, and you can kind of get a feel for the song now. Very mellow, you know, almost pretty. Back to Stairway to Heaven, here’s that same section, reversed. In every single instance, the only way the audience could successfully hear the Satanic message was is if the guy said the phrase before he played the song in reverse. Backwards it says “Here’s to my sweet Satan” It says “Here’s to my sweet Satan” How many actually heard that? I heard it. Eric: As you can imagine, it became quite a kind of fun thing for everybody to sit there and spin records backwards and listen ‘what do you hear? what do you hear?' This was all pretty entertaining until this happened. A lot of people hear, the phrase my sweet Satan. Here let me play this backwards. You hear it? My sweet Satan. Backmasking became national news. Not only that, in 1982 labeling albums with “backmasked” songs became a proposed piece of legislation in California. Styx: Last year state legislature in California was so loosened up that they decided some records including ours had backwards Satanic messages on them. But we can honestly and sincerely say, as we stand before you this evening, that the devil had nothing to do with this next song from the Paradise Theater album. A song entitled ""Snowblind."" The rise of heavy metal coinciding with the religious right gaining power seemed to create the perfect storm for an urgent national debate around rock music. But it wasn’t the rock stars that were the center of the conversation. It was their teenage fans. Eric: Rock music evolves in the '50s and then as soon as that happens, almost immediately, you see people, adults, trying to censor or control that music. Kids are expressing themselves and they are letting out their frustrations and their happiness and their joy. They’d say, look at what that music is doing to my child. Remember the Peters Brothers outside that KISS Concert? They're part of the same generation that was listening to Elvis. Decades later, they were judging teens for doing the same thing with KISS. Peter Brothers: From the moment they stepped on stage nobody ever sat down, they kept yelling, and shouting and jumping up and down. Clapping, you can hear them applauding now. The Satanic message is clear, both in the album cover and in the lyrics which are reaching impressionable young minds. More likely than not, your kids have already seen and heard what some of you will see and hear for the first time tonight. When a form of music that our children like becomes linked with ghoulish images and violent theatrics and even suicide, it demands our attention. Perhaps more to the point, the children need our attention. One of the biggest reasons for the backlash against rock music, though, stems from this chart. In the 1980s the youth suicide rate was rising, particularly among the same demographic that that was listening to Heavy Metal: Teenage boys. The kids that listen to this music are killing themselves and each other because of it. The music is called ""Heavy Metal."" Four young people died in a suicide pact, a heavy metal cassette box was found at the the scene. For a lot of young people, the intensity of heavy metal had a big draw — which also made the genre a scapegoat. Eric: Music has always been a calling card for people, it expresses who we are, what we care about, our values. It is an expression of self. Well if your inner-self is kind of torn up and tormented, you're going to look for music that expresses those feelings. If it’s too loud, you’re too old. Take Jay’s father for example he never shared his son’s devotion to the music. Father: I’d yell turn it down, but seriously, I have no objection to what music he likes to listen to. Would you? Jason: What? Turn it down? Jason: Would I turn it down? No I’d turn it up. Jason: Did you see I wasn’t paying attention when the guy asked the question? I’m like what? Jason was one of the kids profiled in a 20/20 segment on the effects of heavy metal. Stone Phillips: Teaneck High has its own group of so-called tough kids, hoods, or burnouts. Some into drinking or drugs, others into not much of anything at all, except heavy metal music. Jason: Even then I couldn't understand that. I was like, it it can’t be the music, you know, it’s gotta be the individual. You gotta have some serious serious serious issues. In this New York Times article about youth suicide, there are a few possible factors. Family breakups, drug abuse, dwindling job and educational opportunities, and of course, the growing availability of guns. Heavy metal never made the list. But the media persisted in looking for answers in the music. Geraldo Rivera: Every single kid whose case we know about, who committed a violent act in Satan’s name was also into heavy metal music. What's your response to that, Ozzy? Ozzy: Well I don’t really know. All I do is make music. I don’t sit down and purposefully plan to freak everybody out. It’s in this Satanic panic environment that the Parents’ Music Resource Center was formed. Their main goal? Create a rating system that would signify to parents how harmful music could be to their kids. They created a 33-minute PSA video that was eerily similar to films made by various Christian groups. But more importantly, their ties to Washington got them a meeting with the Senate. Susan Baker: Some rock artists actually seem to encourage teen suicide. Ozzy Osbourne sings “Suicide Solution"" Blue Oyster Cult sings “Don’t Fear the Reaper” AC/DC sings “Shoot To Thrill” — just last week in Center Point, a small Texas town, a young man took his life while listening to the music of AC/DC. He was not the first. What this all came down to though, was a request for a tiny little label on a record. How bad could that really be? Why was this so threatening to artists? Eric: How much trouble could that cause? And the truth is it causes no problems on its own. But then you look at how that sticker gets used in the world. It becomes very troubling very quickly. Eric: Within literally weeks, you have more than a dozen States who want to include that label's presence in their definition of obscenity, which is a felony. The circus atmosphere of the hearing was certainly entertaining, but the fact that it even happened in the first place was terrifying for musicians. Eric: When you get into the 1990s and the sticker starts coming out, a big problem immediately emerges, which is at that time the largest retailer of music in the United States by not little bit, but a huge margin, was Wal-Mart. Wal-mart, the family-friendly retail chain immediately felt pressure to keep albums with the label off their shelves. Eric So the record labels figured out, ""Hey, well maybe we can create a version of this album that does not have the sticker on it."" And then Wal-mart will buy it. Album covers were changed. Song titles were changed. Entire songs were omitted from albums. Eric: The thing you have to remember about censors is they don't think they're censoring. They think they're protecting people. Rock and roll always thrived on pushing against the system. Songs blasting the PMRC became signifiers of rebellion. Mother, tell your children not to walk my way. Tell your children not to hear my words. What they mean, what they say. Mother. Frank Zappa even made his own warning label. “This album contains material which a truly free society would neither fear nor suppress.” In an unfortunate twist of fate for this guy, the 1980s saw a huge uptick in albums with intentional backmasked messages, poking fun at the whole controversy. If Tipper Gore had paid a bit more attention to “Darling Nikki” she would’ve probably heard something she liked. “I’m fine. Fiiiine. Cause I know that the Lord is coming soon.” In 1990, the explicit lyrics sticker was finally put into effect. And a new genre of music was taking over the charts, one that would fuel the conversation around censoring lyrics over the next decade. [OPRAH: And this next group calls itself NWA which stands for N—s with attitude. Their album Straight Outta Compton went platinum. Critics say their lyrics promote violence and urge black youngsters to kill policemen. The explicit lyrics sticker seems pretty innocuous now. Some of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful albums of the last 25 years have carried it. Kendrick Lamar’s Damn is an album filled with backmasked messages. There’s clear references to sex, addiction, violence, and evil. It would have probably made it to the top of the filthy fifteen list in 1985. In 2018 though, it won the Pulitzer Prize in music. The first non-classical or jazz album to do so. We’ve come a long way, but that doesn’t mean we left censorship behind. Eric: The truth is, any parent has the right to decide what their children are going to see. It's one of the toughest things about being a parent And that's what this whole argument comes down to. People who are willing to either A) be the voice of deciding what's appropriate or not for your children or the people who say, which is more horrifying to me, people who are willing to let that other person make their choice for them. Thanks so much for watching episode 1 of season 2, all about the explicit lyric sticker. There are so many stories and angles into why we have the explicit lyric sticker in the first place that I just simply wasn't able to fit into this episode. But I really want to talk about them, so in the Video Lab I'll soon be sharing a behind-the-scenes peek at all of the research that went into this episode, and all of the angles into this story that I wasn't able to fit in, but might still pique your interest. So join the Video Lab, and I'll see you there. "
4,Sports,17,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,14NTlDvmzyc,"This is biathlon. A timed ski race where you shoot at rifle ranges along the course. It’s awesome, but also kind of odd. There’s no other sport that combines athleticism and weaponry the same way. Although it’s popular in Europe, most Americans only know it from whatever James Bond movie that was. It’s For Your Eyes Only, by the way. But that’s not the point. Biathlon isn’t just a trivia answer, it’s a competitive professional sport with military roots that stretch back centuries. And it all started in Norway with a guy named Oscar. Oscar Wergeland was a Norwegian military officer who loved skiing. In 1865 he wrote a book of ski drills for his troops. Before then, members of the Swedish and Norwegian border patrol had been meeting for contests that combined skiing with rifle shooting. But Wergeland’s book turned the mixture into an official exercise and the idea took off. Throughout Europe, militaries began building up their ski troops and by World War I, soldiers on both sides were fighting on skis. After the war, the creation of the Winter Olympics gave ski troops a new purpose. In 1924, a demonstration of skiing and shooting was added to the first ever winter Olympics. It was called “Military Patrol” and the participants were soldiers from nations attending the games. The Olympic demonstration continued for a couple of decades, But outside of the Olympics, ski warfare continued. In 1939, Finnish ski troops, fought the Russians in in a World War II invasion called “The Winter War”. Finland fights on. Although they lost the battle, the Finns used alpine skills, particularly skiing, to inflict major losses against the Russians. As World War II evolved, countries on both sides saw the success of Finland and started creating propaganda for their own winter warfare battalions. The US had its own winter unit, the 10th Mountain division, which prepared for conflict in Europe by training on mountains in Colorado and Washington State. He learns how to wax his skis. Three years after the war ended, military patrol was demonstrated for the last time at the 1948 Olympics in St. Moritz. But that didn’t stop amateurs from competing on their own. Civilians began hosting competitions that combined skiing with shooting and that led to a petition for official Olympic recognition. In 1960 at Squaw Valley, the sport returned to the Winter Games as an official event called “biathlon”. That was the moment biathlon went from being a Norwegian military drill to a competitive professional sport. Although rules and headwear have changed through the 70s, 80s, and 90s, modern biathlon is a clear product of its military origins. The sport mimics the sharp transition between physical effort and mental focus experienced by soldiers in battle. Biathletes shoot when their heart rate is extremely high, and their breathing can make it really difficult to hit five targets in a row. But unlike soldiers, the penalty for modern athletes is only more time or just more skiing. "
5,Sports,17,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,HNlgISa9Giw,"If you were to put sports and games on a continuum, where the outcomes reflect pure skill on the right side, and pure luck on the left side, where would the big team sports go? Somewhere in the middle right? But in what order? There’s actually a way to estimate that using statistics, and this is where they end up. “What you find is the NBA is the sport that’s farthest away from random, and then you go down the line and hockey is actually the sport that’s closest to randomness.” Michael Mauboussin did these calculations for his book, The Success Equation, and his findings remind us what we love so much about these sports. Mauboussin’s continuum is based on the regular season for each league. And he found that skill explains less than half of the season standings for the NHL. But that’s not to say hockey players are any less skilled. “All these athletes, all these players are amazing. Amazing. Almost inconceivable how good they are.” The continuum doesn’t tell us how skilled the players are, it’s more like how well their sport measures their skill. So a big factor is the sample size, or the number of games in a season. Major league baseball teams play 162 games. Compare that to the NFL, where teams play only 16 games. The small sample size pushes football toward the luck side of the continuum, since it’s harder for skill to emerge from the noise with so few trials. But the number of games doesn’t explain everything. Both the NHL and the NBA play 82 games in a season. So their placement has more to do with the dynamics of the game itself. Like the number of chances teams have to score during the game-- that’s another type of sample size. “Basketball, they’re coming down, and they have a shot clock and they have to take lots of shots. They’re forced to take shots, so there’s a lot of samples that go back and forth. Ice hockey of course is much more fluid, possessions are much less discrete.” They don’t even have a way to measure possessions in hockey, which gives you a sense of how little sustained control those players have. The number of players matters too. Tennis is a sport where skill plays a much bigger role, in large part because there simply aren’t many people involved. That’s why Serena Williams could hold the number one rank for 186 consecutive weeks from 2013 to 2016. When skill dominates, outcomes are more predictable. In a sport like swimming or sprinting, the activities are even more individual. Essentially racing a clock. There’s nothing standing between the athlete’s skill and their ranking. But in team sports you have more players and lots of interactions. And what matters isn’t just how many are on the field at a time, but how possession is distributed among a team’s players over the course of the game. Baseball requires the nine hitters on a team to take turns at bat. “Ideal would be, wouldn’t it be awesome if our best hitter hit every time? And our weaker players never play at all. In basketball, in a sense, you can do a little bit of that. I mean, not quite, but you can have LeBron James playing most of the game, whereas the very best hockey player, Sidney Crosby, is going to be on the ice 22, 23 minutes per game. He’s their superstar. Hockey is inherently really fast and erratic, so even the best players need to rest, putting some limits on how much their skill can influence the results. Whereas in football you have the quarterback involved in every offensive play. “I think football does boil down to a few skilled players, typically. And I would say probably the quarterback - head coach combination becomes the most important determinant or predictor of success.” And then you have the question of the talent pool. Basketball inherently rewards unusually tall players. This chart shows the height and weight of different positions in different leagues. These are NBA players, and here’s the height of the average American man. “So what happens is you shrink your sample size, in anything, a small sample size, you get a lot of variance. So saying that differently, there are 7-ft players that are really skillful, and there are 7 foot players that are not quite as skillful, and they’re both in the NBA by virtue of their height. As a consequence you get more variance and so skill tends to assert itself more.” Soccer and hockey don’t require such an outlier body type, so you’d expect less variance in player skill. And that leaves more to luck. To understand what that means, you have to see how Mauboussin calculated all this. “I learned this, by the way, from the sports analytics guys, so I wasn’t clever enough to come up with this myself. But there’s a really interesting concept in statistics called pythagorean theorem of statistics.” It says that you have two random, independent variables, then you can add their variances. Variance is a measure of how spread out a dataset is. For our purposes, the equation looks like this: The variance of the observed, real life results equals the variance of skill plus the variance of luck. Skill plus luck equals everything that happened. “So you think about how do we apply this to sports, and we’ll use basketball as an example. So what do we know? We know the actual variance of win loss records of all the professional sports teams right? Basketball teams. So that’s a known.” Over a season, some teams win about half of their games, some do a lot better than that, some a lot worse. So if the variance is a measure of how spread out those win-loss records are for the league, you can see that you have more variance in basketball than hockey. The other part of the equation estimates what the results would be in an all-luck world. “So if instead of playing every basketball game, the teams just went out and flipped a coin, and whoever won the coin toss, and they went back and took showers and went home.” The variance of luck varies from sport to sport depending on how many games are in a season. More games mean lower variance of luck, just like the more times you flip a coin, the closer your data gets to 50-50. “Now we have two out of the three pieces of the equation, and what that allows us to do is then estimate the contribution of the other distribution.” Basically what this asks is: how different does the real world look from a world in which the winners are just chosen at random? He averaged the results of 5 seasons for each sport, and that’s how he placed them on the continuum. If you were to look at just the playoffs rather than the regular season, you might get a different result. According to one analysis, baseball playoffs are the worst at ensuring the best team wins. Which raises the question of what we want our sports to do. Do we want to measure skill as precisely as possible? Or do we just want to feel alive? “We’re there to enjoy the journey, right, to have both the highs and lows, and having the highs and lows is kind of what makes it engaging as a fan. I think that’s part of the whole human condition that makes it really fun for us to watch. "
6,Sports,17,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,VA_P3p7MI98,"The 1932 Olympics was the first time figure skating was set to music. It was live music. The skaters didn't get to choose the songs, the orchestra just played the same one over and over. Fast forward to today, music is very much the heart of figure skating and custom-made for each performance. Oh, but It wouldn't be a figure skating competition if there was no Swan Lake, if there was no Don Quixote, if there was no Carmen. This is Adam Rippon. He's the 2016 national champion and 2018 Olympian. he has ever competed in, he says there was at least one skate set to Carmen. I mean we love our Carmen what can I say? And he's right. There was the infamous battle of the Carmens in the 1988 Olympics. German skater Katarina Witt and an American skater Debi Thomas both performed their long program to Carmen. It's time to compare Carmens. I've skated to Carmen so I mean like I'm guilty of my own charge. So, what makes Carmen Carmen is an opera written by a french composer Georges Bizet about a gypsy girl named Carmen. So it's not just one song called Carmen, it's actually dozens of songs and the most recognizable is probably... But you probably have heard of this one... this one... and this one. You get the point. This is... Carmen is often sassy and flirty and as you can see, lots of skaters take advantage of that. But her story ends tragically when she's stabbed to death by her rejected lover. With Carmen, Hugo and other music designers can explore a full range of emotions. This structure allows skaters to start strong with jumps, grabbing people's attention. In the slower section, skaters can show more of a vulnerable side and also save energy for the big finale For my short program I wanted to do something that was a really upbeat that would get the crowd like on their feet, everybody clapping. And then in the free skate I wanted to show like a softer side, I wanted to show off my lyrical skating style. That's why operas are so popular in figure skating. It's divided into acts with a clear story line. We're gluttons for punishment, because you know we'll roll our eyes at somebody skating to Carmen and then on the complete flipside of that, every year we'll go to our choreographer and we'll be like what do you think of this? It's Carmen. But this long era of Carmen might be coming to an end. In 2014 the International Skating Union changed the music rules to allow skaters to skate to music with lyrics. It was an attempt to appeal to a younger audience, so skaters like Jimmy Ma have traded in Bizet for... Lil' John. When we were given the option to skate to music with lyrics, it opened it up to any piece of music you could ever want to skate to. Now with more freedom and access to all kinds of music, they're looking for their new Carmen. Will it be Lil' Jon? You never know. I found throughout my whole entire career that if you see somebody doing something that they really love to do, that really translates so much, that even if you're not a big fan of the music you just enjoy that person enjoying what they're doing. And maybe this rule change will spur a new era in skating, like 1932 Olympics when the sport was still new. And the official report quotes, "
7,Sports,17,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,c1gCtoxyfF8,"Muhammad Ali was, the story goes, the greatest boxer of all time. But that’s not why he’ll be remembered as the greatest. Yeah, he was incredibly fast in the ring. Ali: There’s not a heavyweight in the world fast enough to stop me He was so powerful, his biggest fights never went 16 rounds. But ali's greatness is all about the other punches he threw. “I SHOOK UP THE WORLD, I SHOOK UP THE WORLD, I SHOOK UP THE WORLD” He always made his boxing about something much bigger than himself Ali: I wanna fight for the prestige – not for me, but to uplift my brothers who are sleeping on a concrete floors today in America. For example, listen to this story about after he won the gold medal in the 1960 olympics. Ali: I took my gold medal. Thought I’d invented something I said “I’m gonna get my people [?] I’m the champion of the whole world. I know I can eat downtown now. I went downtown and had my big old medal on. And at that time things weren’t integrated the black peoples couldn’t eat downtown. And I went downtown and I sat down and I said “cup of coffee and a hot dog” this young lady she said “We don’t serve negroes” and I was so mad I said “I don’t eat em either just give me cup of coffee” So it might not be a surprise that an early mentor was Malcolm X, then of the Nation of Islam. Have you been advising him as far as his religious affiliations are concerned? Malcom X: Well no I don’t give advice to anyone. Most people know he changed his name based on his religious beliefs. But while most accounts say Cassius changed his name to Muhammad Ali, that’s not the whole story. The morning after Cassius became heavyweight champ, he confirmed publicly that he was a member of the Nation of Islam and he and Malcolm X announced his new name. David Remnick: He said he was Cassius X. Ali: Clay was a white man’s name. It was a slave name. The X was the Nation of Islam’s way of rejecting a name bestowed by whites. Days later, Elijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, went further. Manning marable: bestowing upon Cassius X an original name Muhammad Ali, which “beloved of god” Ali: So I’m now Muhammad Ali But he refused to change it legally: Ali: The judge is what color? He’s white. In other words I’d have to ask a white man “May I call myself Muhammad Ali, boss?” He refused the draft to serve in vietnam as a conscientious objector. That meant losing his title, losing his profession. and being convicted in court. Ali: My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother or some darker people or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful America and shoot them for what? They never called me nigger. They never lynched me, they never put dogs on me, they never robbed me of my nationality, raped and killed my mother and father. Shoot them for what? I don’t have to go and shoot them. Just take me to jail. But his moral stand brought him into the civil rights movement. He befriended Martin Luther King Jr. despite their differences, Reporter: What did you discuss back in the hotel room? Ali: Nothing. We’re just friends. Just like Kruschev and Kennedy United against oppression and the war. MLK: As Muhammad Ali has just said, we are all victims of the same system of oppression. And even though we may have different religious beliefs, this does not at all bring about a difference in terms of our concern. Ali: Still brothers Reporter: Do you share the same concern that Muhammad has for his draft status? MLK: Oh I certainly do. You know my views on the draft are very clear. I’m against it. And he took his case of conscientious objection to the supreme court. Ali: I haven’t burnt my own draft records. But what I’m doing is legal. This is why I believe I’ll receive justice in the higher courts. You can deny the draft on any grounds but you gonna have to go to court. It’s law. If you lose you go to jail which I said I’ll do. My fight is legal. Most people avoided the draft however they could, burning their draft cards, or using a complicated series deferments like Future president Bill Clinton did. Ali: But if you notice I’ve been the most persecuted. I’m not allowed to work in American I’m not allowed America. Home of the brave land of the free. Reporter: Are there times when you miss being heavyweight champ of the world? Ali: No, they miss me. Reporter: I know that Ali: You know I don’t miss it. I’m not missing it. Though he was able to return to boxing, he never stopped shaking things up. Ali: The Vietcong are not all bad but America are still dropping bombs. In Hiroshima, Japan wasn’t bad but she still dropped the bomb. In Korea they wasn’t bad but they still dropped the bomb. So now I’m gonna forget the 400 years of lynching and raping and depriving my people of freedom and justice and equality… and I’m gonna look at two or three white people who are trying to do right and don’t see the other million trying to kill me? He used these media appearances over and over to try to promote trying to live a moral life. Ali: As you know in this country a black athlete or entertainer has a lot of influence. Some of them promote some of them make movies. I’d like to do all i can to uplift the people morally, and spiritually as far as Loving ourselves, sticking together and helping ourselves. Before uh, expecting others to help them, to respect them when they don’t respect themselves.. Johnny Carson: Well having known you for as long as I do, I don’t know anybody who’s better qualified to do that than you, and I know you mean it. After he retired, he even saved a man from jumping to his death in 1981: Reporter: The former heavyweight champion went to a window and reportedly yelled “I’m your brother. I want to help you.” Recognizing Ali, the man finally opened the fire escape door and Ali approached him on the ledge. He helped negotiate the release of 14 hostages in iraq. He stood with Nelson Mandela against apartheid. He delivered medical supplies and food to kids all over the world. And though his genetic disease, parkinson’s, cruelly impaired his function, that never stopped his ability to inspire billions. Three billion people watched this in 1996. And in one of his final public appearances, he spoke out about islam after the devastating attacks of September 11th, even though he could barely speak. Ali: I’m a Muslim. I’ve been a Muslim for 20 years. And I’m against killing, violence. And all Muslims are against it. I think the people should know the real truth about Islam. You know me, I’m a boxer. I’m called the Greatest of All Time. People recognize me for being a boxer and a man of truth. And I wouldn’t be here representing Islam if it was really like the terrorist look. I think that all the people should know the truth and come to recognize the truth because Islam is peace and against killing, murder, and the terrorist that do it in the name of islam. And If I had the chance, I’d do something about it. And last winter, when he could no longer speak, he wrote a statement against comments from Donald Trump that lumped the actions of a few murderers in Paris and San Bernadino with 1.5 Billion muslims around the world. He said “Speaking as someone who has never been accused of political correctness, I believe that our political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people's views on what Islam really is” Ali was a fighter, but i don’t think his muscles are really the part we care about. And it’s not what he cared about either Ali: “Boxing was just my way of introducing me to the struggle. My main fight is for freedom and equality. Money don’t really mean nothing because gave up the title not knowing if I’m coming back or not for four years. So these gloves represent a lot more than physical punching. And today, a pair of them have been in the President’s private offices the past 8 years. Ali: For this fight I’ve wrestled with alligators I’ve tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning and put thunder in jail. You know I’m bad. I murdered a rock, Injured a stone, and I Hospitalized a brick. I’m so bad, I make medicine sick. I’m so fast, man, I can run through a hurricane and don’t get wet. When George Foreman meets me he’ll pay his debt. I can drown and drink of water and kill a dead tree. Wait till you see Muhammad Ali. "
8,Sports,17,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,e22yH5hUQ_A,"gather around their televisions surrounded by loved ones, to watch the Big Game. And the pinnacle event of the most profitable sports league in the world is more often than not played in a new state-of-the-art stadium with super-sized digital displays retractable roofs luxurious box seats and suites. Teams generally earn the lion's share of the revenue from the stadium. But for 28 of the 32 teams it's the taxpayers in the team's host city who paid to build it. If the privately owned teams earn the stadium's revenue why are they built with public money? A new NFL stadium is being built nearly every year and their price tags are reaching into the billions. This chart shows all the different home fields NFL teams have played in since 1960. Stadiums built in the '70s and '80s have lasted, on average, over 30 years. But now a stadium's lifespan may be less than two decades Washington's owner started asking for a new stadium back when FedEx Field was only 17 years old. Though some stadiums, like the Giants/Jets MetLife Stadium are built with 100% private financing public tax dollars have financed the vast majority of NFL stadiums built in the last 20 years. That's over 7 billion in public money going towards building and renovating NFL stadiums. NFL owners argue that a new stadium will generate new construction jobs while the venue is being built all the new spending from ticket sales, hotels, parking, tourism would cascade into the community, the wider area and would create a boom in the local economy I asked an urban planning economist if stadiums really are a good public investment. Most of the stadiums we have built in United States, they do not provide any positive impact - most of them. What else you could have done with this money? Let's say they are raising 200 million dollar and there is investing in a stadium. Instead of doing that, if they spend that money on roads, infrastructure, shopping malls, or public parks. Things that benefit the whole public, not just football fans. For team owners, new stadiums mean  millions more in profits. They sell the name of the stadium to other corporations, host the Super Bowl, and owners maximize revenue by building more and more luxury suites and club seating in the place of general admission seats. Over a third of the seats are premium in the  Cowboys' 82,000 seat stadium and a luxury suite can cost as much  as $30,000 per game. The push for new stadiums comes down to increasing profits for the owners, but cities try to meet these demands because there's more to a football franchise than the bottom line. Residents want teams and the hometown pride that comes with it. Even for people who never attended a game there's a shared experience,  a collective enthusiasm for the home team. In one poll three-quarters of Indiananpolis citizens said losing the city's NFL team would hurt the city compared to 68% who said it would hurt to lose all the city's museums. This is coming from a city and state that  funded 86% of their new stadium even though the previous  stadium still owes millions in debt. Team owners, they have successfully tied this stadium to a civic pride. And that's why When cities refuse to build new stadiums owners threaten to move their teams to somewhere that will. That's what happened in 2016 to St. Louis and 2017 to San Diego and Oakland. New stadiums aren't the economic powerhouses owners promise they'll be. But as long as there are more cities that want a home team than there are franchises, it looks like the taxpayers are gonna keep footing the bill. "
9,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,-Uha5c7hJdA,"There is a lot wrong with the way our industry does loot boxes. We've seen loot box systems that are game breaking, others that are exploitative, some that are even downright unethical. And if that has made you wary of this monetization model, I can't blame you. But, I'm not sure I'm on board with the demands to eliminate the model entirely, or even to never put them in $60 games. It's... complicated, let's talk about it. [Intro music] ""Penguin Cap"" by CarboHydroM To start, let's review why the industry is turning to supplemental monetization models like lootboxes. If you watched our previous two episodes, you'll recall that player expectations for AAA game fidelity, and the cost of building games to meet that fidelity standard, have been on the rise for years. And yet, the purchase price for a AAA game, remains locked at 60 dollars, regardless of rising costs or inflation, and that's starting to get untenable. If you want to learn more about that, I recommend checking these two episodes out later. The ultimate dilemma, though, is that AAA studios need to see higher profits to match the higher costs, but they can't do so by raising prices. James was at a convention a few weeks ago and he asked the audience: ""How many of you would buy just as many games each year if they cost $80?"" Two people out of an audience of hundreds raised their hand, and that is what the games industry is afraid of. And so they've been exploring supplemental revenue models to make up the difference. We've tried subscription fees and DLC, micro-transactions, season passes and collector's editions, but our most successful experiment so far is lootboxes. And it's not that surprising that they're so successful. They're basically the video game equivalent of a Magic the Gathering booster pack, and the thing you gotta know about Magic booster packs is that, for a very long time, they were the highest earning per-user monetization item in all of gaming. It's a time tested and extremely successful model. Now obviously the benefits of this model for the developer are huge. Loot box content is generally far less expensive to produce than DLC or expansions and the possibility for duplicates inevitably means that players will end up purchasing more content than the devs actually make. Done well, it handily solves that $60 price tag problem. And I would argue that this benefits players in some significant ways as well. I see a lot of people complain that games with loot boxes are trying to make everybody pay hundreds of dollars to enjoy the game, but it's actually the exact opposite case. Some players being willing to spend hundreds of dollars on these games is what makes it easier for the industry to sell these games at the more affordable $60 price. Those big loot box spenders are subsidizing that $60 price tag for the rest of us. And obviously game companies aren't doing it out of the kindness of their hearts. Higher profits are unquestionably their goal, but this is functionally what a successful supplemental profit model like loot boxes achieves. Games of increasing scale and fidelity sold at the same standard price, keeping those games affordable for more of us. And the same principle applies in the free to play space. I have personally gotten to enjoy hundreds of games for free, because other players were paying the developer's salary by buying loot boxes and card packs. That is a fantastic thing that I would never want to see go away. But, that subsidy should be freely given. I have got no qualms with some rich folks throwing tons of money at these games so the rest of us can play affordably, especially if the content they're buying is strictly cosmetic in nature, but only if they are not being conned into spending money they can't afford, and that is where this gets more complicated. Because frankly, despite all of that positive stuff I just said, a lot of companies are deploying loot box systems that are exploitative. There are games out there using everything we know about the human brain to try to get people to spend money they don't have, and that is a legit ""capital P"" Problem. Now there are some common myths around this that need dispelling: First, you'll hear some claiming that these games are preying on children, trying to get them to spend tens of thousands of their parents' money but this is actually very rare. It makes for a good news story, so every time it does happen, we hear about it. There are also consumer protections in almost every affluent country at this point which force game companies to refund purchases made by minors if a parent requests it. Most game companies actually HATE having to deal with children purchasing their stuff, because it just creates so many headaches. That said, anyone who is doing this, that is actual evil. I can't believe I have to say this sentence but: Don't prey on children, please! The second and much more common discussion point you'll hear is that loot boxes are gambling or are at least similar enough to gambling that they'll either -cause gambling addiction, or, at the very least, prey on those vulnerable to gambling addiction. This... needs more study. It may well be true, but the only major study I've seen on the matter, didn't find that to be the case. Both legally and psychologically, there's an important distinction between gambling and non gambling and that is the ability to cash out. Because you can't take your rare Overwatch skin and sell it back to Blizzard for actual spending money, the experience affects us differently. Video game loot boxes are less like craps and roulette and are more akin to a crane game, or a blind box, or the raffle for prizes at the county fair. At least that's what the science seems to suggest right now. Again, this requires a lot more serious study. I've seen a number of psychologists voice their personal opinions, some saying ""of course it's gambling,"" others saying ""of course it's not gambling"" but really it just reinforces the point. We need to actually scientifically look into this,  and on a large scale, because if loot boxes and booster packs and such are causing or triggering actual gambling addiction, that is something we need to know about. And if they're not, that's something we need to know too, because constantly insisting that they are could lead to a whole host of legal problems that I don't have time to get into today. But in either case, a lot of game companies are making use of B.F. Skinner's research on compulsion mechanics to create their payout schedules for loot boxes which is the same research slot machine companies use. We can do better than that. In fact, we HAVE to do better than that. We can make getting a loot box feel rewarding without using psychological tricks to try to manipulate players into buying more of them. Now in the limited amount of real research that there has been on this, I have found one thread that really does sadden me. Rather than gambling addiction, those people who spend too much money on loot boxes were actually found to be suffering from some form of social anxiety or social pressure. Those who spent money they couldn't afford to, often did so because they felt like they were going to let their guild down if they didn't, or because they feared they would lose their top dog status and feel humiliated if they didn't keep paying. This is something that much of the industry does still lean heavily into when designing these and that is wrong. That is something we should never do. Be on the lookout for that stuff because, especially in the mobile and the free to play world, that kind of predatory approach has become so common it's, almost taken for granted today. At the end of the day, I don't have a problem with loot boxes as a monetization model, even in $60 games. When designed ethically, the loot box model allows allows rich folks to pay more money so the game stays affordable for the rest of us, and that is alright by me. If someone has a bunch of money to throw around and they want to buy something ludicrous, our society generally seems pretty OK with that. It's like a rich person choosing to buy a Ferrari. If they want to throw $300,000 at a car that looks cooler and drives better than any vehicle most of us will ever get to drive, that is something our society lets them do. Do I think they could spend that money on something better than a sports car or cosmetics in a video game? Oh yeah. Definitely. Do I think that they should do better things for humanity with that money? Yeah, probably. But, it's not my money. And at least, unlike the Ferrari, them buying loot boxes helps to keep the cost of games down for the rest of us. Just, games industry, don't be evil about this. This really shouldn't have to be said. People like games. People are OK with spending money on games. You don't have to make your loot boxes as exploitative as possible to maximize your revenue. You have got a solid monetization system here, just don't break it for yourself. In fact, just look to Battlefront II for your object lesson. If you get greedy and drop a badly-designed loot box system in front of your players, you will lose revenue like you wouldn't believe. I might come back to that Battlefront mess in a later episode, because, hmm, boy. But, suffice it to say, your customers aren't robots. Designing a more-efficient system for them to mechanistically put money in, to get more money out of them, won't work. Maximizing profit, in this case, isn't actually the way to maximize profit. You know what? You have a conscience. Use the dang thing. At the same time, we as an audience have to understand what we are asking for. We can't expect game makers to keep prices the same at the expense of their ability to keep the lights on. We have to find better answers. We have to reward the companies that create good loot box systems. I mean, absolutely do get out there and complain if some company serves up an exploitative or terrible monetization system, just, don't expect supplemental monetization systems to go away. That, or, just be ready to start paying $80 per game, which I don't think is anybody's preference. Besides, there is another reason we need to be careful what we ask for, legal reasons, in fact. But, I am running way too long on this already, so I will save that for next time. Thanks for watching, I'll see you next week. [Outro] ""High Tide"" by FoxyPanda "
10,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,1FBGR6vmNeU,"When we talk about AI in games We're not really talking about artificial intelligence We're talking about decision Trees Specifically decision trees created for computer-controlled actors That are there for one purpose and one purpose only To make your game more engaging Game AI So with that in mind what actually makes for good game AI Game AI is really just a marketing term for NPC behavior And as designers and programmers when we're crafting behaviors for NPCS There's only three vectors that we're really looking to succeed on One Is the player able to learn or intuit these behaviors? Two Do the behaviors create interesting decisions for the player? And three Is creating these behaviors and efficient use of resources Are you getting enough bang for your buck? So let's look at each of those and talk about what they really mean First How do you make NPC behavior learnable and intuitable for the player To answer that I first need to dispel one commonly held misconception Complex AI does not equal good AI Complexity is not interesting Or rather complexity by itself is not interesting You'll often hear videogame marketing talk about a game having the most complex AI ever developed But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's better Or even good I mean if I came up to you and said hey check this out ""I have devised the most complex stairway ever built"" Or This is the most complex set of instructions ever made for preparing microwave burritos Does that mean that I have designed the best stairs or microwave burrito instructions? It does not Those things are not necessarily going to do their jobs better just because they are more complex And game AI is the same way Especially if you want your AI to be learnable Learable AI or NPC behaviour Is behaviour that the developers have crafted with the idea that the player will Over time Come to understand exactly how that NPC behaves The simplest example of this would be the enemies in 'Super Mario brothers' These creatures have almost no code happening under the hood All these Goombas and Koopas require to function is a single line of script That says move left and if you collide with something, reverse direction But because they are so predictable once the player learns how they work Then the player will be able to make perfectly informed decisions around them 'Super Mario brothers' is interesting not because of how the enemies react to you But rather how you react to the enemies And as with all games with learnable NPC behavior Part of the engagement and player progression is in slowly learning them more deeply When you first start playing 'Mario' You will almost immediately figure out that goombas move left Which allows you to begin making decisions for how to deal with them right away Soon, you'll also learn that they will fall in pits if you let them And eventually as you begin mastering the game you'll get a sense for exactly how fast they move As you learn each of these elements Your mastery over the game increases And your interactions with these enemies become more refined Now 'Shmups' represent a much more complex version of this In most 'Shmups' like in 'Mario' There's actually no decision tree running the AI The enemies don't change their behavior in reaction to what the player is doing But the behavior is defining how enemies move The patterns they shoot and when they shoot them are far more complex than the behaviour of the Goomba These gains gear themselves towards players who revel in learning those patterns And figuring out how that knowledge combines with the game's mechanics to allow them to overcome every obstacle So that's learn about a Intuitable AI is different though Intuitable AI is actually responsive It has actual decision trees running under the hood The simplest example of this is the enemy in an FPS that dives for cover when you throw a grenade This enemy won't ever dive for cover unless you do that It is responding to what you do Somewhere in the code there is a line that says something like ""If grenade is within damaging radius and cover is nearby, then leap behind nearest cover"" The NPC is making a decision based on what you did But because it's responsive it won't always be a 100% predictable Unlike the Shmup enemy who constantly zips to the same place and does the same thing The FPS soldier may leap to a different cover depending on where they are when you throw the grenade And once they're at that cover point well all bets are off Now the enemy has gone somewhere that the designer could not have anticipated them being And if you had thrown that grenade one second sooner they might have jumped somewhere else And if you hadn't thrown that grenade at all well who knows where they might have ended up This means that the shooter NPC needs a behavior tree In order to adapt on the fly to whatever situation it ends up in Often these trees are as simple as if out of cover run, nearest cover Or if in cover, pop-up every three seconds, shoot for one second then duck back in cover But the key to these behavior trees Even if they end up involving more complex stuff like squad coordination behavior or flanking movements Is that they need to be intuitable by the player Even though the player doesn't know exactly where the NPC is going to dive when they throw that grenade When they do see that NPC dive They should be able to understand what it's doing and why If they can intuit it then they can respond and play around the NPC's actions And that is essential if your NPC is gonna meet the second requirement That it creates interesting decisions for the player Your NPC behavior not only has to be learnable or intuitable It also has to highlight the core of your game Is it there to allow the player to make heady strategic decisions? Or to enable them to show off incredible feats of coordination and dexterity? NPC behavior also has to take into account where in the game it's going to be featured The earlier in the game the enemy appears the more room it has to give the player for error And the broader the players options in addressing it have to be Later in the game NPC behavior may serve to drive the player towards more interesting play styles or mechanics that they might have overlooked Overall though whenever you're creating a new behavior or a set of decisions for an NPC You simply have to ask yourself How does this set up an opportunity for the player to make interesting decisions within the game? Once you have learnable or intuitable behavior that is successfully creating interesting decisions Then comes the final fundamental design question How can you get the most bang for your buck? How can you deliver on these behaviors efficiently? Don't use enormous decision trees when a basic critics could get the job done just fine Don't try to model absolutely lifelike behavior when something much simpler would be more engaging for your players Don't create one super complicated enemy behavior set When you could be more easily creating two simpler enemies That would provide a wider range of options And make the player feel like there was more variety to your game This is how all game development works and the building behaviors is no exception Always ask yourself if the manpower and CPU resources required for the thing you're building could be better used elsewhere But for all of this, there's one thing that I've still not discussed And it relates to gaming AI's future So far we've talked about using NPC behaviors to increase the mechanical engagement of the player Their engagement with the play of the game But we haven't talked about the next frontier How do we use AI to increase emotional or narrative engagement? Fret not this is something that James is deeply interested in And something that he is actively working on in his consulting life If you folks are interested let us know we can definitely come back to this Until then see you next week!

11,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,26ZX7NbOhks,"The outcry around Star Wars Battlefront II kicked quite the hornet's nest. Even major non-gaming news outlets picked up the story, and as soon as that happened, politicians jumped on the bandwagon, seeing an easy way to score some political points. And, if you're not a fan of the loot box monetization model, that's probably been pretty exciting to see, which I can understand. But if I may pump the breaks just a little bit, we should probably at least consider the potential consequences of what we're asking for. After the Battlefront II debacle, a number of politicians came out saying that something must be done about loot boxes, and that they were gonna protect our kids from the horrible addiction of video games. But I want to specifically talk about Chris Lee, the Majority Whip for Hawaii. He has been perhaps the loudest voice on this, and he's not a bad guy. He's young, he's an effective politician, and it seems like he actually does know a thing or two about games. He took this on specifically because he thought it was an issue that will engage millennial voters, which, depending on how you view it, is either awesome because he decided to do something about an issue his constituents were vocal about, or a little cynical and dismissive because he thinks younger voters care more about video games than larger world issues. But in either case, the reason I bring up Lee is because he said that he wants to regulate loot boxes under Hawaii's gambling laws. This is basically the angle that every U.S politician has approached the issue from, and there are a whole host of problems with applying those specific laws to this issue. For one thing, gambling is illegal in a number of states. Not just to facilitate, but to participate in. This means that, under those laws, game makers aren't just committing a crime by selling these games, players are committing a crime by playing them. In some states, those players would be liable for felony level offenses, and that is not okay. Lee has also suggested that games with loot boxes be treated like gambling machines and be restricted to players 21 and up, which... look. Before we decide that somebody under 21 can't have access to a piece of art, you had better have very good data to show that that art is gonna do lasting harm. When I was growing up, people used to have bumper stickers that said ""I buy music for minors"", because the US government briefly tried to prevent anybody under 18 from buying music with explicit lyrics. That whole endeavor was absurd, and saying that nobody under 21 can play Overwatch because it has loot boxes in it is, to me, just as damaging. Now, to be fair, Lee specifically calls out ""Pay-to-Win"" loot boxes most of the time when he talks about this issue. But from what I've been able to find, nobody's really taking the wider ramifications of this sort of legislation into account. Ever since Magic: The Gathering took off, microtransaction games have avoided the gambling label because the system doesn't allow you to cash out. You cannot sell your Overwatch skins back to Blizzard, or your Madden players back to EA. Which, at least in the eyes of the law as I understand it, meant that they didn't have real-world value. This, effectively, made your purchase of a loot box or a booster pack less like placing your chips on red, and more like buying a raffle ticket. But if we did decide that loot boxes fit the legal definition of gambling, that changes a lot of things. Suddenly, non-transactable digital goods will almost certainly have to be considered as having real world value in the eyes of the law, and that creates all sorts of problems. Like, first off, banning players. I have seen so many player responses to bans over my career, and one of the most common, often from the most toxic, racist, or homophobic players is, ""You can't ban me. I have spent $300 on your game. You're stealing my money, and I am going to sue you."" Now, right now, that argument carries no weight. Almost all game EULA's have language that just says you can be banned for violating Terms of Service. No lawyer is ever gonna take up that case. But what happens when digital goods suddenly do have real-world value, and companies have to start worrying about being sued over bans? Will toxic players be able to, effectively, buy themselves immunity to disciplinary action? Will companies be even more hesitant to ban that one horribly toxic guy who's dropped 200k on the game because they know they'll be legally responsible for destroying 200k worth of that person's property. And what about shutting down servers? Once non-transactable digital goods have monetary value, how do you handle closing down a game server? Do you have to give all the players their money back? Could somebody sue to stop you from shutting the server down? And what about rollbacks? Let's say a dupe exploit is found in your game and players are duping gold left and right, just destroying the in-game economy and making the game experience miserable as a result. But if gold can be purchased in your game, if you erase all of that gold that people acquired unfairly are you liable for it? And what about the gold earned legitimately by players during the hours you're gonna have to rollback? And the legal questions just keep on cascading from there. I mean, every monster in an RPG has a random drop rate for goods which essentially makes it a walking loot box. If access to some monster is locked behind a paywall, is that gambling? I know that seems like a silly question but it does provide companies an easy way to circumvent loot box laws. Much like netmarble and Blizzard did to sell loot boxes in China by instead selling currency and having it come with quote 'free' loot boxes. If I can't sell you a loot box, but I can turn that loot box into a boss that drops random loot and make you pay money to enter the dungeon where that boss lives, is that a loot box? Cause that's functionally the model for almost every MMO out there. I mean each WoW expansion comes with new raids, and new raid bosses with better loot which can't be accessed unless you pay for access. Is it gambling if I make you pay a dollar every time you try to do a raid but not gambling if I charge you thirty-five dollars to be able to do the raid as often as you want? You see what I mean? There is a whole bunch of effects this sort of legislation could have on games beyond simply restricting loot boxes as a model. So we got to be incredibly careful about how we approach this legislation. Just like Mr. Lee himself has said, a change to these laws in just one or two states could have an enormous effect on the games we make. And of course this isn't to say we shouldn't look into legislating or regulating this stuff. We absolutely should. Requiring game makers to post the odds for their loot boxes? Great! Forcing game makers to put in a pop-up alert when you've spent X dollars in a week saying hey You've already spent $50 on loot boxes this week, are you sure you want to spend more? Also great! Making it so that at least once a year every item sold via loot boxes must be put on sale at a fixed price in the in-game store? Totally great. Not allowing kids under 21 to buy games with loot boxes in them? Not great. Potentially having consumers charged with illegal gambling for playing games with loot boxes in them? Definitely not great. All I'm saying is that we just have to be careful about these things. Good legislation takes a lot of time and thought and study and we consumers should be just as eager to see that time and thought and study happen as we are to decry the things we dislike. Before we go though, I just want to say we have a great deal of respect for Chris Lee here. I am legitimately glad he's interested in making sure that our laws keep up with our technology. We think he's done many admirable things, and we think it's excellent that he's created a public discourse around this. We disagree with the suggested implementation he and others have pitched, but at least he's listening. We should be having this discourse. And in fairness to him, we've put links to his videos on the topic in the video description below. I would encourage you to check them out, so you can get both sides of this rather than simply our side. And if you do, I would ask that everybody be respectful and go in with the mindset that this is a person trying to listen and trying to do something about our complaints. If we can start a true dialogue here, maybe together we can all find an answer that prevents loot box abuses without doing unnecessary splash damage to the medium at large. Oh hey, we got an update here. Since the writing of this episode, house bill 2686 was entered into the Hawaii State House, which would, if passed, make it quote 'be unlawful for any retailer to sell any person under 21 years of age a video game that contains a system of further purchasing: a randomized reward or rewards or a virtual item which can be redeemed to directly or indirectly receive a randomized reward or rewards'. So if you're under 21 in Hawaii And you want to try out Hearthstone or Madden or Overwatch or Counter-Strike or Call of Duty or PubG you might want to go pick those up now. Just cause it might become a lot harder to do that soon. Anyway. See you next week. "
12,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,4DynhzEQtog,"Let's talk about asymmetric level design, and the interesting case of Overwatch which for a lot of reasons has some of the most wildly asymmetric levels that I have seen in a multiplayer first-person shooter. [Intro music] Designing levels for competitive multiplayer games where the level design is asymmetric is a contentious thing. Even in games like MOBAs where the map is nearly symmetrical for both teams, minor minute differences, like which characters start near which monsters create a preference for players, and lead to players seeing one starting location as being more advantageous than the other. Meaning somebody's always gonna be unhappy. And it's a fine line for a designer to walk. Asymmetry provides variety and creates interesting tactical options for the player every time they play but it can also leave players just feeling frustrated and like the game is unfair every time they end up on the side they see as having a disadvantage. So first, let's talk about standard asymmetric level design. Usually in asymmetric games, as the designer, you create all sorts of ways to make the action flow through the map. action flow through the map whether it's Whether it's a team deathmatch or capture the flag a team deathmatch or capture the flag you'll notice that on any well designed map, the action doesn't just occur at one point for the entire length of a match the action doesn't just occur at one point for the entire length of a match. Instead, you'll find yourself pushing through different choke points or dislodging your opponent from different sets of good cover. or dislodging your opponent from You'll be taking different high ground areas or sniper spots as you go. you'll be taking different high ground Sometimes these are subtle: sometimes these are subtle maybe you Maybe you simply have to push the enemy back enough simply have to push the enemy back to move forward to the next bit of cover. Or sometimes these can be as drastic as pushing the enemy out of a set of buildings. But each time this happens, and players flow through the map, it does two important things. First, the players get to think through new tactical problems. Lines of sight are constantly changing, cover layouts change, height advantages change on different conflict points on the map. height advantages change on different This is interesting for the player! It's what makes the game feel vibrant and alive. it's what makes the game feel vibrant Second, it constantly switches which team or players have an advantage. Each new stopping point on the players' circulation through the map should alter who gets an edge from the asymmetric terrain which keeps the map feeling challenging but fair. There are a number of systems we use to achieve this: there are a number of systems we use to Baked into the level itself are conflict points. These are places everybody wants to be because they're objectives or because they're advantageous these are places everybody wants to be like bunkers, hilltops, that sort of thing. Players will naturally gravitate toward those areas and the fight will naturally erupt around them as players try to take control As a battle erupts around one of these conflict points it will naturally drag other players in because that's where the action is. Eventually the assaulting side will either push through eventually the assaulting side will or find the flank and push the possessing side back, bringing the flow of the game to whatever the next conflict point is as one side falls back and the other one surges forward. Or one of the sides may just give up the point as the fight becomes either no longer tenable or simply unwinnable. Either way, the conflict flows onto new areas. This is often augmented by the spawn system. There's a lot of different philosophies around how to spawn the player into first person shooters. You could spawn them at a fixed location for the whole match. You could spawn them at one of a number of fixed spawn points. You could spawn them near a teammate. You could spawn them away from any action that's going on. And there's reasoning behind all of these options. In fact, just talking about what the different spawning mechanics do might make for an interesting episode one day. But for right now, the important thing is that, excluding the largely outmoded idea of spawning the player at a single fixed spawning location for an entire match, all of these options help the flow of play and encourages players to move to new conflict points. If the game has power ups or weapon pickups, these too can be used as conflict points and a way to drive the players from point to point so that the map feels varied but fair. But however you do it, your built-in map flow also has to depend on two other crucial questions. As a designer building an asymmetric map, you have to ask yourself: Are the players' goals asymmetric and are the players avatars' asymmetric? Because both of those have a huge effect on map design. And here is where we get to Overwatch. Because in Overwatch, the answer to both of those questions is yes. (at least most of the time) In Overwatch, there are basically two types of maps: In one type, one team is assaulting, trying to take ground and the other one is defending, trying to hold ground. In the other type, both teams are fighting to control a central objective. Interestingly, the second game type usually gives us maps that barely feel asymmetric at all as the design involves only one central conflict point with a group of minor conflict points radiating out from it Which often represent different paths to the central conflict point. Note that this is the only map type where they use a single fully fixed spawn location implying that the designers felt that asymmetry had far less impact on this map type and that they didn't have to put as much emphasis on see-sawing between which team gets the most advantage out of the maps' limited asymmetry. So let's look at the attackers vs defenders maps, because those are wildly asymmetric. Intentionally so! The flow of each match through these maps is pretty evident. The designers channel the players' movements much more clearly than your standard team deathmatch shooter. And because the designers know the map flow, this means that they can develop a type that creates a specific tension and interest curve for their online FPS. At least, theoretically The first thing to notice on all of these maps is that the attackers have the initial advantage. The first point the defenders are tasked with guarding usually gives the attacker lots of alternate paths to flank from and a modicum of cover. And the choke points are either relatively easy to break or can be avoided by smart flanking play On top of that, any defender who gets taken out has to hoof it all the way from their initial spawn point at the end of the map back to the area their team is trying to defend while the attackers respawn much closer to the initial conflict. Even if the defenders and the attackers suffer equal losses the respawn distance advantage will push the attack forward. But as points fall or carts are pushed, the situation flips. The attackers' final goal usually sits at the end of one narrow corridor without any alternate routes to flank from and little cover to hide behind. And now the defenders have the respawn distance advantage as their spawn point is often right behind the goal Even trades now work in the defenders' favor as their fallen teammates return to the fight in mere seconds. When this all works, it creates wonderfully nail-biting situations where the games come down to the last second. It makes both the attack and the defense feel like desperate hard-fought struggles while at the same time giving each match a sense of motion and progress. First the outer defenses collapse, and then the inner defenses fall until the defenders are left performing a desperate last stand on a patch of ground designed for desperate last stands. But! When you have this massive asymmetry that channels players down a specific path rather than allowing them to flow through the level naturally, you create a much more difficult balance problem. Because normally, when a particular conflict point is a bit too unbalanced in favor of one side or the other, players will naturally move their focus elsewhere and conflict will start again at some other point on the map. But that's not possible in this case. Which means that the balance of Overwatch's attacker-defender maps needs be tuned almost perfectly. And some of them are! Some of these levels are masterpieces of multiplayer design but there are others where that balance is just slightly off. Where the first point typically falls quickly and then the match turns into a seven-minute grind fest where the attackers throw themselves at an overly secure final defense point. Because these maps are designed to flow down one specific path, there's no self-correcting mechanism in place to resolve the imbalance. Hopefully in time, the Overwatch team will be able to sand away those few remaining rough edges until all of the game's levels live up to that perfectly crafted interest curve. It's a daring and ambitious goal, one that has rarely, if ever, been pulled off. But they've got a lot of sharp people in that studio, so we'll see what happens. But Overwatch's asymmetry isn't limited to level design. Next week, we'll talk about the game's most prominent asymmetric feature: Its characters. See ya then! (boop!) [Outro music] "
13,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,4Kk_JImecgs,"Dear Max and Dave... ♪ [Extra Credits theme] ♪ For years in grade school, when I was right around your age, we had these exercises where they would take us to the library and tell us to research a topic, or give us research papers where we were supposed to find seventeen sources and list them in our bibliography. But for me, none of this ever stuck. No one ever really explained why you needed seventeen sources, or why you even needed two sources. Heck, nobody ever explained to me why we needed to research at all. Games taught me different. There were lots of games I had read the Prima strategy guides for, or dug through Nintendo Power to find out about their secrets, but when I got to high school, I started playing a game called EverQuest. Now, I spent far, far too much time playing this game, of course, but as I played, I realized that I could play better, level faster, and get better equipment if I didn't just play the game, but studied it. So, night after night, I would pore over webpages comparing leveling paths and investigating where to get the best gear for my level. I probably spent half as much time looking into the game as playing it! Because I learnt that I could play twice as effectively if I really learned what I should do. And, besides this, there was something exciting to the learning - to just going out there, and studying something that I was interested in, and forever having knowledge that I didn't have before. So I would go out with every free minute I had and hunt down all the information I could. I would cross-check leveling guides, bookmark the gear I wanted to acquire, and filter out all the bad and unreliable information that came with those early days of the Internet. Then one day, I was given this massive history report to do. And as I started looking into it, I felt so clever, because I realized I could use the same techniques to find out everything I needed to know for this paper. I could do it quickly, and efficiently, because I knew how to hunt for this stuff, unlike all of those who didn't spend their days researching stuff. And, man, I just attacked this thing. I dove into it, thinking about how quickly I was gonna to be able to rip through this thing and still nail it. Then, I stopped. I remember the exact moment - I had Soundgarden turned up to 12. It was so loud that I couldn't even hear my keystrokes, despite the fact that I was pounding away at my old, grey, monochrome keyboard on the Windows 95 box in my folks' basement. And there it hit me: This wasn't like what I had been doing for EverQuest - it was the exact same thing I had been doing for EverQuest! Playing that game had taught me to research. To really research. To understand how to filter the sea of knowledge that's out there and come away with what I need. And it wasn't just EverQuest - I did this all the time for games. I did it when I was trying to get your sister all the Pokémon in the very first version of Red, I did it when getting ready for StarCraft tournaments, in the days when Battle.net was a new thing, and I see you doing it all the time playing Minecraft. You go to wikis, you go to YouTube, and you hone in on exactly what you want to learn. You do the research you need to get the knowledge that's gonna make you more successful. We live in an incredible world right now, where anything you want to learn, anything you want the answers to, is available at your fingertips if you know how to look for it. Games will teach you just that. Games will teach you how to look - or, rather, games will motivate you to teach yourself that without you even realizing it. And this skill has carried me through my whole life - through college, through graduate school, when I went to get my first job as a designer, even when I write these episodes today! When I first needed to know how to start a company, you know what I did? I used the exact same skills that helped me figure out how to get through Lower Guck. The first time I wanted to build a computer for myself, I wasn't intimidated because I knew I could go out there and get all the information I need. I could find step by step instructions. I could get a broad overview. I could find out what parts were best for the price. And all that is no different than what you do to figure out how to make a cool redstone contraption. But perhaps the most important part of this is that games left me unafraid. They had armed me with this tool and told me that I could use it to learn anything, and in doing so put things that were mystical and out of my reach within my grasp. This may not resonate for you for years, but I have seen many of the people I know hesitate or simply give up on things they wanted because they felt like they didn't know how to do them. But for me, it was different. After all, if I can slay ogres and unearth ancient artifacts, [Outro music starts playing] why should I feel like I can't fix a car, or start a business, or tie a tie?

14,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,4Ozi-S4QMZQ,"When does a game become gambling? If you've been to a gambling expo in the past, let's say, two years, then you probably saw something interesting. Guitar Hero, Space Invaders, Candy Crush - skill-based games that allow the player to rack up winnings when they achieve a goal, or lose money when they fail. Casinos are turning to these skill based games, or hybrid skill and chance games, due to a demographic shift. You see, young people don't really like slot machines, so to attract them youths, the gaming industry well okay not the gaming industry you're thinking of, the other one that makes like slot machines and video poker and stuff. I mean technically gaming industry is the proper term but just for the sake of clarity I'm gonna call them the casino industry. Anyway, the casino industry is hoping that game based machines will pull in a fresh batch of young millennial gamblers. They've even rewritten gambling laws to accommodate new machines that rely on performance rather than mere chance. But it isn't just the casinos who are getting into videogame gambling. As you have probably heard, Valve is currently cracking down on third-party websites that leverage Counter-Strike GO weapon skin trading as a form of gambling. With all of these factors coming into play at once, designers have to start thinking seriously about how they want to approach gambling in games, even if, like Valve, they don't intend for people to use them for gambling. This raises a lot of ethical questions that the industry hasn't had to consider before, so let's go ahead and try to address it now while it's still on the horizon. First of all, just to say this upfront there's nothing inherently wrong with developers creating games for the casino industry. Gambling is legal in many places and provided developers go about it in an ethical manner and abide by local laws there's a lot worse things you could be doing as a high-tech company. In fact, when we started looking at this topic we were ourselves initially worried that the melding of video games and gambling might make kids more likely to form a gambling addiction later in life, but gambling addiction experts that we consulted shrugged off that idea. It turns out that gambling addiction rates remain pretty consistent either way, and though a childhood affinity for games of chance can predict future gambling behaviours, there's no evidence that these games somehow turn people into gamblers which I mean I guess that makes sense; it's not like everybody who spun the wheel in Candy Land became a roulette fiend, but there are still a lot of things to consider: the first is the worrying possibility of what may happen when we combine the incentivized feedback loop of games with the already addictive practice of gambling. We've talked about this a bunch of times already so I won't repeat myself talking about that danger. You can see our episodes on humane design, exit points, and the Skinner box if you want to dig into that subject more yourself. Suffice it to say that building a humanely designed casino game will be a very hard line to walk, but that's not to say that it can't be done. Second: if a designer decides to make a casino game, or adapt a game they've already made for gambling use, the casino version needs to be different in immediately obvious ways, by which I mean police should be able to easily tell them apart without any special training. We've already seen machines come out of China that are basically slot machines disguises arcade games and that's allowed unscrupulous arcades to double as gambling dens. Third: designers need to make sure that these games that they're making are actually games, not just glorified random number generators. One of the good things about casinos deploying skill-based games is that they provide inherent entertainment value. They aren't just mindless slot machines or roulette wheels where players get hooked on dopamine, they're more like poker: a thing you can enjoy in and of itself with winning money just being a fun bonus. It's better for the casino too. I mean, part of why Millennials hate slot machines is that they aren't inherently fun to play. But ok, enough about casinos. What about a normal shooter with loot boxes and item drops? How can a developer ensure that they won't end up in Valve's position where their game becomes an unintended venue for wagering? The simplest solution is to take the Overwatch or Hearthstone route where you don't let players trade digital goods from loot drops. Now I understand that suggestion may not be the most popular one because, boy, we dropped just as much money as anyone else trying to get that Mercy halloween skin, but that system does at least ensure that developers aren't exposed to legal challenges because no transaction between players - no trouble. But there are legitimate reasons to want players to be able to trade loot. After all, it creates a player economy. It fosters social interaction, and it gives loot a sense of value. Trading opportunities make it more exciting when a player hits the jackpot from a random drop, and it offers them some consolation if they get an item they can't use. So how can developers regulate trade in a way that isn't open to bad actors? Well, first let's review how skin gambling works. In Counter-Strike GO, players can obtain skins for weapons or characters via in-game loot drops, with certain skins being rarer or more sought after than others. Players can then trade these skins to each other, or buy and sell them for funds in their steam wallet. But, they can't sell them for real world currency. However, third-party gambling sites, unaffiliated with Valve, have offered venues where people can use these skins as casino chips, betting them on professional CSGO matches or even at simulated table games like roulette, blackjack and slot machines. When players win or lose, the skins they have wagered get automatically traded through steam via bots controlled by the third-party gambling site, which also offers to cash those skins out for real currency. Now, obviously this is illegal. And worse, a lot of underage kids got sucked into skin gambling. Valve is currently cracking down by sending cease-and-desist letters but there are other things developers can do to make sure that gambling doesn't become an accidental feature of their games. The first is to monitor transaction volumes, and flag accounts with substantially higher activity than the mean. Now sure, some of these will just be power players, but at least it narrows down the data set to help discover the bad actors. Developers can also track one-way transactions where a player sends skins to somebody while getting nothing, or something of negligible value, in return. If a developer can easily identify accounts that seem over-generous, they've gone a long way toward identifying who is giving or getting skins from an external bet. After all, power players are trying to make a profit, not give away stuff for free. Another avenue for shutting down the trade is bot hunting. Many gambling sites execute these trades via bots, and if developers can detect those accounts and lock them out, it will go a long way toward killing the site, because let's be honest, if players bid skins at one of these sites and then never get those gambled assets back because the bot accounts got locked, that site is going to lose its customer base pretty quickly. And while it is true that gambling sites will just turn to vpns or domain masking to create new bots, well, there are tools to counter that too. Just ask Netflix. But probably the best way to keep players away from gambling is by informing the public that many of these sites just aren't fair. After all, legal casinos are heavily regulated to ensure that gains meet payout standards but underground gambling operations? They can offer crooked odds. In fact, that whole Valve case first broke when it was revealed that the youtubers doing how-to videos about a gambling site actually owned the site they were promoting. Some even got the numbers ahead of time so that they could demonstrate how easy it was to get a large payout. And that revelation damaged those sites as much as any cease-and-desist. If developers are willing to talk about these sites in terms of consumer protection it might prevent people from going there in the first place, and prevent their players from getting burned at the table. Now, this is a rapidly evolving topic, and likely to shift in the next few years as gambling sites find ways around roadblocks, but it's important to keep it on our radar. The more games become an integral part of our lives, the more real-life problems they inherit. That's just the price of success. See you next time! "
15,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,569XsBCxkCE," Welcome to the third and final installment in our December series of your stories on why games matter. Today's is brought to us by Zhenghua Yang, who also goes by Z. Enjoy! Yesterday I spent three hours hanging out with some of my best friends whom I haven't seen for years. And today, with only three hours of time, I accomplished a major goal in life, and I feel absolutely amazing. What did I do? I played three hours of League of Legends. And that may not seem like a big thing to you, But to even be able to do that is unbelievable to me. Video games define our world. They have played a huge part in my life, and I would not be here today without them. It all started in my freshman year of college. The day before Halloween, I began having a steady nosebleed. Being the introverted nerve that I am, I continued to study for my midterm the next day while trying to plug it up with paper tissues. It wasn't until later that night that I knew I needed help: I continuously choked on my own blood trying to get some sleep. After a friend ardently urged me to go, I brought myself up to the college health center to get my blood tested. My nosebleed lasted 14 hours that day, and it turned out that the reason was that my platelets were at a mere 22 K per liter of blood, the normal range being 150 to 400 K. I was instructed to go home, get some rest, and come back the next morning for further monitoring. Halloween came and I went back to the health center first thing in the morning. The result was, unfortunately, not good. My platelets were now at 20k per liter of blood. Dropping 2K overnight. The doctor told me to go to the City Hospital ER immediately. As soon as I arrived at the hospital, the staff went nuts. Nurses would stab me with countless needles for blood testing and doctors would conduct interviews with classes of students following them around. I was confused and frightened. I finally called one of the nurses and asked them what is causing all of the commotion. He pulled out my paperwork and pointed to a number and my heart sank. It turns out that, due to the number being so low, the previous doctor misread my platelet count. It was not 20k that morning, it was 2k, and it was dropping rapidly. Within an hour I began bleeding out of my body, out of my nostrils, and countless bruises began to take form. I quickly lost consciousness due to low blood pressure. Hours later I woke up in a dark and gloomy room. A nurse walked in and explained how they were unable to find the cause of my illness. She told me I was gonna die in a few hours. She handed me my will and left me in silence. Miraculously, I didn't die that night. However, I ended up hospitalized for two straight years. From the age of 18 to 20. These were the two most difficult years I have ever had. Not because of the pain or because therapy was difficult. It was hard, because I had lost the hope to accomplish anything in life. I no longer had a future. I lost contact with all of my friends, I had people who later told me they thought I was dead. My family suffered alongside me. My parents didn't know what to do or how to make me feel better. We all lived with the constant danger that I could die at any moment. Through these two years, through my loneliness and despair, I turned to the one thing that gave me meaning: playing video games. I began playing all sorts of games: single-player games like Final Fantasy or Braid and multiplayer games like World of Warcraft or League of Legends. In these single-player RPGs I regained the will to continue living. Helping people and saving the world in games like Chronotrigger would give me greater meaning in life. Even though the game wasn't real, it was the closest I had to having any purpose to survive. Then there were the multiplayer games. With over 10,000 hours logged in mmorpgs I made friends from all over the world. These internet friends of mine didn't always even speak English, but they would check up on me, making sure that I'd been taking my medicine and asking me, if I'd been getting rest. Not only that, one of my online friends was a medical researcher and he connected me with some of the world's best hematologists. With his recommendations I met with doctors who gave me critical advice that kept me alive. The amazing thing is, to this day, I still don't know that friends real name. By playing video games, by gaining a new perspective on life I slowly began to recover. By 2011 I was able to go back to school to continue my education. However, I couldn't help that think back and ask myself: these games, like Final Fantasy and League of Legends, they weren't designed to help me and yet, they did. What if we began creating games with the intention to help others? That's when I began my career in creating value driven games. I started Serenity Forge, a game development and publishing company that focuses on meaningful games. I began by turning the story of my illness into a non-fictional visual novel called Loving Life and released it online for free. Since then we've created dozens of games and interactive experiences that would inspire art, foster education and promote health. Through my near fatal illness and my newfound passion in the game industry I learned a valuable lesson: videogames are no longer just toys for kids and we must begin treating them with a practical perspective. Games can teach practical skills, they can advance science, they can heal trauma and they can solve conflicts. Two gamers can play side by side virtually in a game of League of Legends working together to achieve a common goal. They don't need to share the same language, the same culture, even the same world beliefs. It doesn't matter if they're American or Chinese, Israeli or Palestinian. Our next Nobel Peace prize winners are no longer just gonna be the influential artists or the policy generators, but maybe, instead, it'll be the kid who's in a garage right now creating the next big game that brings the world together through play. When I was going through chemotherapy, when I was on my deathbed, I had no hope of a future in the end. In the end, video games saved my life, and they just might save yours, too. Thanks again to Z for his story and to all of you for watching! Extra Credits is going to go on a bit of a break to catch up with the family for the holidays and to get some much-needed rest. We will be back in mid-January with our regular content. Until then, I hope all of you have a wonderful holiday! Take care of each other. We'll see you soon! "
16,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,5DuDambEIMU,"In Japanese, there's a word called 'Ma'. It is space or rest. It can be seen in noh dramas, Japanese calligraphy or in the long white expanses of a zen garden. It's built into Japanese architecture and inherent in Japanese poetry. It can even be found in the long slope and shots of anime. But it's something that many games are missing, and it's something which a great many might benefit from. [Intro Music] Ma is a nearly impossible concept to translate because it's not exactly how we think of a musical rest or a blank space on a painting in the Western tradition. It's not just about having the negative space help define the foreground... ...rather It's about the negative space being one continuous piece with the image itself. Neither the blank space nor the filled space is the point of the piece but rather together they simply form the experience the piece provides. So what does this have to do with video games? Well... MA is about using the rhythm of emptiness or inaction to create uncluttered experiences. Think of it this way Clutter isn't about the amount of things in a space but rather how they're arranged. A room can feel cluttered if everything's just littered on the floor but the same room with the exact same things in it can feel wide open and liberating if everything is put away on shelves or nicely arranged. And this is Important for modern entertainment. In the film world you can think of Michael Bay as the ultimate in anti-Ma. More often than not there's too much stuff happening to continuously in his films, and when there are rests they feel... awkward. Like they're all in the wrong places. At times they feel almost stiflingly cluttered and that's unfortunately the direction we've gone with Triple A games But instead I would like to see these games fury roading it up, for lack of a better term. There's no less action and no less stuff going on in Mad Max fury road than any transformers film... ...but it is filled with Ma; with the pervading sense of slowness, that makes the action something you can really appreciate, and... something that's stays with you long after you've got out of your chair. That's because all experiences have two components: The objective component [What is actually happening in the moment], and... ...the subjective experience [the thing that the experiencer feels]. Take for example a sunset. Two people can watch the same sunset (that is to say have the same objective experience) and yet to one it can be a celebration of the wonders of life, and to the other it can be a sorrowful reminder of the ebbing away of time. But without Ma; Without space; that second bit (the subjective part of the experience) is impossible. Without Ma we don't notice the sunset at all. We rush through our busy day and don't give it a second glance. Much less have the internal space to process and create our own personal and subjective experience of that sunset. And the internal rhythm of arts rests and blank spaces; that internal Ma... ...can help give us the capacity to have that subjective experience. A Michael Bay film or the Call of Duty Infinite Warfare campaign throws things at us so fast that we're pushed through the experience. We get through it because it doesn't give us time to realize we might want to stop, but at the end of it we actually remember very little vividly. Now compare this with something like The Witcher 3, Prey, or even the most recent God of War. The ability of the designers to trust the player to handle a few moments with nothing, where they're simply riding across a beautiful landscape or stalking through haunted halls, sets the player up to be able to process what they're experiencing. This allows the game (even if just on a subconscious level) to take on meaning or to create some feeling in them, even if that feeling might simply be awe [surprised face]. But Ma doesn't simply take the form of time without action Games are complex things with many types of rhythms and spaces within them. If we think about Ma as the transformational power of emptiness, rests or blank space. Then we can see that any aspect of a game that has the possibility to be cluttered can be devoid of the minimalism Ma brings. Detroit is at its best in the one moment where it doesn't rush all over itself to tell you its narrative and instead just sets you down in a hellish graveyard. And in that moment. It's also the best at getting its narrative across. Destiny 2 is best when it focuses on simple shooting and doesn't whiplash between trying to be a serious space opera and a comedic sci-fi romp. When we talk about Ma part of what we're talking about is stripping away all that's unnecessary to make room for that blank space. That blank space will then transform what's left into something to remember, as we craft our games we must continuously ask ourselves: ""Why?"" with every decision we make, and unless we can really justify each thing we build there are definitely still pieces to be stripped away and replaced with an absence. Flower, Shadow of the Colossus, Nier Automata. These are all games about Ma. They're games about Ma for radically different reasons, but they're all games where the things left unsaid, the mechanics left out, the system's never implemented; make room for the player to fully experience them. But since Ma is about space, about a rest rather than action. It's difficult to completely define. The best definition that I've heard was one man who said that extravagance is complete silence, not a riot of color, not the gaudy gold's we sometimes associate with extravagance, but a moment of simple silence between the noise. And that's a lesson that many games, [cat mews, ""Hey, there""] And apparently Zoe [the cat], could benefit from today. We'll see you next time. [Zoe, the cat, purring] [Outro Music] "

These letters contain all that I have learned from playing games. All the things that have carried me through life thus far; all the things that have helped me along the way. I don’t know which you’ll need most, but I know that you love games, so I hope this resonates with you and helps you to see all the value in your passion. If anybody ever gives you a hard time and says that there is nothing to learn from playing games show them these. The first and perhaps most important thing that games ever taught me was to never give up. This sounds trite: it’s something that every storybook and every parent says, but the whole reason it sounds trite is because - in all of those forms - it’s a very easy thing to say but in real life it is often very hard to do. Only games ever hammered this lesson home for me. I was in my teens, playing at a Magic tournament. We were fairly far in, to the point where every win meant greater prizes. We were on the third of a best of three. Things had been close all game but I had finally started to pull ahead on the board. So I’m looking at what I’ve got, I'm pondering my turn… when my opponent suddenly throws down his hand and starts sweeping up his cards. He’d given up. And I was baffled. Between rounds, I sat there trying to figure out exactly what had happened. Sure, I had been winning that match, but not by that much... Then I saw it. My opponent had been right. I actually did have a play that would have won the game that turn... but the thing is: I don’t know if I would have seen it. It had just taken me minutes of pondering to find, and only when I had known there was a move to find. I might have thrown the game by accident if my opponent had just stayed in. And then it hit me.  Giving up is a zero EV play. There is no percent of the time where giving up is more likely to get you what you want than not giving up. The only thing to weigh is the cost of continuing, so if it’s something that really, really matters to you, there is just zero reason to give up. So long as you’re in it, there is always some small percent. Some answer, some way that you might be able to claw your way back. Nothing is ever over until the very end. And I’ve tried to live my life that way ever since. And it’s been hard. There are all sorts of times where you’re too exhausted, or too embarrassed, or just too afraid to keep fighting, But unlike a parable or a fable, games didn’t just teach me this; they force me to practice it constantly. Every time I know I’m beat, every time I want to throw in the towel, they give me an opportunity not to, and I know it’s the right play. I started keeping score. And it didn’t happen often, but I would say that, in one out of every hundred games I was just about to lose, my opponent would misplay and I would claw back in it. One out of every few hundred, they would just disconnect and I would win by default. And then there are the times when I would just get lucky and - simply by sticking around and giving luck the time it needs – it would win me the game. Overall, I would say that my win percentage on the games I play seriously is probably 1-2% higher simply because I never hit that concede button. And while 1-2% may not seem like much, you would be surprised at the work you have to put in to increase your win rate by an extra 1-2% in most of these games. And in life, where choosing to not give up isn’t simply committing yourself to the length of a match, but a matter of years, or perhaps decades, and where there are so many strange opportunities for luck to kick in, or for whatever’s keeping you from what you want to stumble, I think I’ve gotten a lot more out of life simply because every time I’m about to give up, I remember that match. Now there will be times where the cost of not giving up is too great, for you or those around you, but games have taught me that those times are far, far fewer than they seem. Thank you for watching, and for sticking with us for these 300 episodes. It is a joy. We’ll see you next week. [Music: “Hang in There” by YoshiBlade] "
18,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,9iUfVT0pgDI,"As last year was wrapping up, James was asked to share his opinion for some of those ""Hot Trends of 2016"" articles. These sort of predictions are inherently silly and the single best way to stick your foot in your mouth. But there were a couple of interesting things that caused James to think about that aren't really being discussed about in most of those pieces. So what the heck, let's talk about a few of them here. (intro) Now I'm not making predictions here because I have no idea what's going to happen, but there are definitely a few interesting things worth keeping an eye on during 2016. Things that have a chance to affect the industry depending on how they pan out. They're not the sort of things that we'll see an enormous impact from this year, but depending on what we see from them this year, we may be able to suss out some of the big things things that'll happen in the industry a few years down the line. I'm gonna start with the one that I'm personally most intrigued by, the portable Steam Machine. For a long time I've struggled to see a place in the market for the Steam Machine. There are people who are absolutely going to love it, of course. But for many of the people who are interested enough in Steam Games to pay for a specialized piece of hardware to play them, well, they already have. They picked up a PC that's robust enough that it can do more than just browse the internet and pump out Word documents. Which means that for a lot of the folks out there they really don't see the point in picking up something they could easily have just right now by plugging their current device into a TV. But the idea of a portable Steam Machine makes a ton more sense to me. I mean, there's a lot of PC games out there that would be fun to play on the go, but on the industry side it presents an additional benefit. It would allow smaller developers to crack into the portable market without sacrificing the ability to develop for PC. All you'd have to do is make sure your main specs are in-line with whatever the baseline Steam Machine portable is. And don't get me wrong, I love touchpad games, too, but this could mean that we finally see a portable market where it makes economic sense to develop for a controller-styled device again and one that doesn't have the strictures and hardware limitations of current Nintendo devices. Of course, much of this depends on how well the built-in Steam controller works on the go and whether the initial generation of games for the portable Steam Machine manage to build in a UI setup that's viable on both a standard screen and a tiny handheld one. Still, bringing the diversity and ease of development of the PC market to the handheld space could provide us with a host of experiences we've never been able to get on the go before. Or it could just tank. I don't know. Next, there's two really interesting questions coming out of China to watch this year. I think the big one surrounds the rapid acquisition of non-Chinese game developers by Chinese companies. Up until this point, there's been an almost mad dash for Chinese companies to acquire Western developers. But I think this year we'll see the natural coalescing of a clearer strategy for how to go about this, because there have been some huge successes that have come out of this mad dash, but also some major failures. The gold rush phase is clearly coming to an end and I believe we're entering a more strategic, more measured phase of acquisition. What this refined acquisition strategy will eventually become is unclear, but as we watch it begin to come together this year, we'll get some idea of both the amount of Chinese capital available in the future and the amount of control Chinese parent companies expect to have over their acquisitions. I think a good canary in the coal mine is going to be Riot. It'll be interesting to see how hands-off Tencent remains with Riot after the 100% acquisition that happened. So far, despite many articles warning of the influence of Chinese publishers, many of the Chinese acquisitions have actually remained more independent than companies acquired by major U.S. publishers like EA. And Riot has been so phenomenally successful that there's really no reason for a parent company to tinker with it. So, if we see any changes, it may be indicative of a shift in thinking about how foreign developers should be managed. Additionally, it's worth watching to see if Tencent tries to better integrate Riot with some of it's other services or tries to leverage the brand more heavily with toys, or films, or spin-off games, or games on other platforms. One of the possibilities for future strategy around many of these acquisitions is to take developers with a successful game and find additional ways to monetize them without messing with the game itself at all. Things that your average developer would struggle to do on their own. Ok, second: I think China has another potentially major seachange waiting in the wings for the game industry. For years, China's had a enormous internal game development market and we've seen this market affect the rest of the world. Many of our mobile free-to-play cues have been borrowed from that industry. But, with the recent lift of the console ban in China, comes the question of whether China will aggressively enter the console market from the software side. That could be big. Watch for the announcement of Chinese console studios this year and look to see if Chinese console products start to see release. If they do, it'll be a shot in the arm for the console industry and open up the question of whether Chinese games will stay locked within China or if efforts will be made to localize them and export them around the globe, bringing an interesting, new cultural perspective to the world of console gaming. Sorry, I know a lot of this has been business-talk, but many significant industry changes are driven by business in some way or another. Which brings me to our last thing. This year, keep an eye on the mega-acquisitions that happened over the last few years. The purchase of Minecraft for 2.5 billion and King for roughly 6 billion. Seeing how those have played out by the start of 2017 is going to be telling. Just to put it in perspective, the combined cost of those 2 game entities is slightly more than Disney paid to get their hands on both Lucasfilm and Marvel. That may seem ridiculous to you and I agree, but I'm also aware that I could be very wrong here. I think this is the year where we'll learn whether or not there is an acquisition bubble happening. I believe there is and, if I'm right, we're going to see the theoretical valuation of a lot of game companies crash over the next few years, making it harder both to get funding and to get a good deal on venture capital in the years to come. But then again, if King manages to control half of the top slots in the Apple store for most of this year, and if Microsoft manages to sell half a billion dollars worth of Minecraft spin-offs and add-ons, or if they announce a Minecraft 2 that somehow manages to eclipse the original, I may be proven incredibly and happily wrong, and we'll all have to rethink what game companies are actually worth. Anyway, I hope that at least makes some of the more innocuous-seeming game news a little more interesting this year. It'll be fun to come back to this episode a few loops of the Earth down the road and see if anything came of these possibilities. See you all next week. "
19,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,9knimHTnrgc,"Okay, the title is a tiny bit of hyperbole, but today I would like to make the business case for localizing basically every game that comes out on a console. ♫ Music intro ♫ This episode is brought to you by ancestry DNA. Go to ancestry.com/extra, or click the link in the description, to get a 10% discount. I am sure that you have all had that experience where you've heard about a game that came  out in some other region, and you were like: 'man, that looks so cool, I wish I could play that...' and often those games are the weird ones, the ones that are considered 'niche' because they so strongly hit all of the obscure and not-new-player-friendly things about a particular genre that you love. But, of course, because they are considered niche, they are the kind of game that never gets localized. But here's the thing about those niche games: those are exactly the type of games that get people to buy consoles. If you are a tactics game fan, and even one really great tactics game comes out exclusively for a platform; that is going to go a long way toward making your purchasing decision on what console you buy. So, here is the business case for localizing basically everything. All of today's platform holders (Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) spend tens of millions of dollars to secure exclusives for their consoles. And that's not just for Triple A games. Even smaller titles can cost multiple millions of dollars to secure as exclusives. After all, for the developers and publishers of those titles, releasing a game on just one single platform means selling to only a fraction of the gaming market. So, the platform holder has to provide financial incentive to do so. Now paying to localize games isn't cheap, but it is a lot cheaper than paying for exclusives. Which actually puts it in the perfect price range, because small to mid-size developers often can't afford to localize their games. They are spending all of their budget just on getting the thing made and out the door. This means that a platform holder (Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo) could offer those developers a deal where the devs can launch on all platforms in their native region, just like they normally would, but in return for six months to a year of exclusivity in other regions. The platform holder would pay their localization costs to get the game released in those other regions. It's a great deal for the developer because now they get to launch in more regions. And it's a great deal for the platform holder because they get a regional exclusive for pennies on the dollar. Now, there's two reasons why this hasn't been done in the past. The first is retail space. If you are a platform holder you don't want to be clogging up your section of the game stuff wall with niche games, much less paying to localize games that'll never even be given space on those already crowded shelves. And of course the corollary to this was you also didn't want to be printing discs and boxes for those games. But that problem is already basically solved. Digital distribution is ubiquitous and even the most die-hard fans of physical media would prefer having the option to buy digital copies of great niche games that have been localized their region. I mean, it's better than those games simply never being localized at all. Of course, there is still the issue of clogging up digital storefronts and running into a Steam situation, but part of that issue comes down to the fact that most every console digital store really needs a UX overhaul and better methods of discovering new things. Really if it turned out to be that big an issue it would be pretty simple to just add one more tab to the store called Great Games From Around the World and shove all of your localized exclusive stuff into that section. If one of them starts really taking off, then you can feature it in the more prominent part of the storefront. Which leads me to the second, and arguably much more valid argument against doing this, and the reason you don't see as many games localized today as you might expect. It's not that localization costs are prohibitive, especially if you aren't localizing voice work; the real reason is that, marketing these games to a new region can often cost ten times as much as the localization itself. But does it have to? For games that have already been published and hyped in another region, I would argue 'no'. Now I admit that I might be on some shaky ground with this argument, because I'm basically saying that you have to trust your most avid customers to actively keep track and pay attention to what you're releasing in their region, which, I know, that probably sounds like a terrible idea to any major publisher, but just hear me out for a second. James imported the Korean release of Demon Souls way before the official U.S. version came out in part because he'd been a big From Software fan from back in the King's Field days, but also in part because they had done a big Asian marketing campaign. From had gotten Demon Souls reviewed on a number of Asian region websites, and in a number of Asian language magazines Through the wonders of the internet that regions marketing push and news of the games positive reception trickled down to people like James This is the important difference I'm getting at. not marketing a game to every new territory you release in, isn't the same as not marketing at all. When a really good indie game gets lost on Steam, it's usually because there's been no good marketing push anywhere. No hype, no developer interviews on sites with a lot of reach, no community building on reddit, nothing. But when you've already done a major marketing push that's already out there, even though that marketing effort may be in a language foreign to most of the people in the new territory you're localizing to, if the game's good, fans of that genre will find out. They crave this stuff. They will translate those interviews and those articles. They will post those Famitsu review scores. They will transmit that knowledge through the player grapevine. That's the nice thing about niche markets. They are pretty ravenous for those weird games they love. Now, will you get as many sales as you would if you did a full marketing campaign? Certainly not. But as the platform holder localizing the game, you're only risking the almost-negligible cost of localization, and you'll still reach some of the most passionate players More importantly, you'll push some of them that much closer to buying your console. And these are the people who will be the loudest voices and your most ardent champions. They're probably the sort of players who get asked all the time by their friends 'which console should I get?' So winning those players over is worth a lot. That's even worth the risk of losing the tiny localization investment on most of the games you localize. I mean, heck, if I heard any one of you console holders say 'Alright, we're going to localize every crazy thing that gets made for this console, so get ready.' I would pick that system up in a heartbeat just for the opportunity of trying all those wacky games out. Think about it. See you next week!

20,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,A6PUReOuHVw,"I really, really like BioWare games. Actually, I love 'em. And I love the romances in them, too. But as I was playing The Witcher III, I was struck by how it posed to me a question that I've never been asked in a BioWare game before. And that got me thinking about why that was. What, from an interactive, storytelling perspective, let the folks at CD Projekt Red do something that I'm not sure you could do in a BioWare title? Oh, and, uh, if you haven't played The Witcher III yet, don't worry, I'm not gonna spoil anything and you really don't need to have played it to follow the episode, so, we're good. In The Witcher III, you have two long term romance options: Triss and Yennefer. Both of whom the main character has a lot of history with and both of whom he's been involved with in the past. His relationship with Yennefer is tumultuous. Burning. In some ways self-destructive but always passionate. His relationship with Triss is more tragic but gentler and less destructive. And now the player has to choose between them. For all the player's history with both of these characters that's not a choice they've had to face before. And this gave me pause. Not because it's something, we've never seen in a game before, but rather because of the subtleties defining the choice. As an example, in most BioWare games when I have the option to choose a character to get romantic with, I feel as though I'm choosing what I want most. It's almost like picking from a buffet. And that's fine but, as we've talked about before, that's not usually how actual romance goes. Especially when confronted with having to choose between two people who you love. Each of whom you've parted from due to circumstances beyond your control. And yet here, they managed to provide a perspective on the simple profundity of that choice. In The Witcher, Geralt's relationship with each of these women represents something in himself. Choosing which of these relationships to pursue isn't simply about what I want as a player but instead, on some level, it's a question of Geralt having to choose between who he is and who he thinks he wants to be. Yennefer is wild, and restless, and free - a mirror to Geralt himself. Triss is caring, and kind, and working to make the world a better place. She's the person that Geralt, below that rough exteriour, believes he wants to be. To love Yennefer is to be true to who he is. To love Triss is to become that better man he imagines himself being. Neither choice is wrong, but both options feel like they require giving something up. And the tug of war here is great, because throughout the game, Yennefer's interactions with Geralt are natural and flirtatious and unbridled, while the interactions with Triss are often more tender and more caring, but they aren't quite as natural for Geralt. And you can feel that, watching them. You can see him wanting to be with Triss while also wanting to be with Yennefer. This is a painful, but eminently human, eminently real dilemma. There is the person, who drives him crazy and the person, who is so much better for him, who he maybe should love. And in being presented with this more nuanced alternative the player is given a chance to make a far more interesting decision than ""Who do I like best?"". And in seing this dilemma play out, we get a deep and meaningful insight into Geralt and, perhaps more importantly in a game, we as players get to make a profound decision about who this character really is. Who my Geralt chose says more to me about Geralt than who my Shephard chose ever said about them. Which leads me to the truly fascinating part of this from a design perspective. For a long time, the prevailing argument has been that a blank slate character is best for truly interactive storytelling. The theory goes that it allows the player to imbue the character with the most of themselves and provides the most flexibility for the player to craft the character they want. But I think The Witcher calls that into question. By having a purely blank-slate to start from as is the case in many of the BioWare games, where you even choose the character's backstory, you may actually limit the narrative situations it's possible to present the player and thus limit the narrative choices you can give them. I can't put a character in a situation where they're torn between choosing the love for who they are or the love for they want to be unless the character not only has those aspects of themselves somewhat defined but is also the sort of character who would care about such things, and who would care about such a choice. By trying to let the player make all the choices about the character, we actually eliminate many of the most nuanced and interesting choices they could make, because the idea of letting a player make all the choices about a character is a fantasy in the first place. We've never actually done that. If we actually let the player make all the small choices that give a character CHARACTER, if we let them have truly unlimited choices in every situation to really create a holistic, rounded realistic person? We'd never build a game. "
21,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,BMYyO6Zd4b8,"A few weeks ago, we finally saw the official announcement for what we all knew was coming: the PS4 Pro, or as I like to think of it, the PS4.5. So what does it mean? Does it change gaming or is it just another weird hardware cash-grab? Before we can talk about anything else, we have to discuss the one thing that Sony won't actually say outright: the PS4 Pro is clearly part of their huge bet on VR. If you're wondering why they decided to up the horsepower of the PS4 at what seems like a sort of random time, I'm fairly convinced that it has to do with decisions made at the height of the VR hype machine. Probably around the same time that Sony decided to give the greenlight to Playstation VR. Because, to run the same games that we've been seeing on the PS4 through a VR headset, at the same fidelity that we get on a TV, requires a more powerful machine. If Sony was willing to gamble on VR enough to make their own headset, they would have to ensure that the VR experience on their console wouldn't just be plain worse than the non-VR experience. After all, if you're trying to play a first-person shooter that runs fine on your TV but runs at half the framerate on your headset because the console just doesn't have the power to render those head mounted dual screens fast enough, you're probably just going to take the headset off and go back to playing the game where it runs smoothly. And in the technological arms race that is console gaming, if you're predicting that VR is the next big thing, you can't be left behind. Hence, the 4.5. Personally, I think that console VR Is a very risky gamble. I'm pretty sure it'll be quite some time before it pays off, if it ever does, but that leaves us in a weird place because regardless of how quickly VR hits mass adoption, now we have two different machines claiming to be the same console and I think the unintended consequences there are huge, or perhaps I don't give Sony enough credit. Maybe they are the intended consequences, who knows? Now, Sony says that every game that runs on the PS4 Pro will also run on a standard PS4 and I am sure that they are absolutely going to enforce that, for a while. But the game development community always wants to play with every ounce of hardware they can get their hands on, and having a game with the best graphics, the coolest physics, or the biggest world, translates to more sales, so you can bet that developers are going to start building for the PS4 Pro even if they aren't allowed to make their titles run exclusively on it. After all, Sony has explicitly said that the PS4 Pro is being put out there to run your games better. So while games may have to run on both the PS4 in the PS4.5, nobody ever said that they have to run as well on both machines. Now, I've heard a lot of talk on the internet that this isn't going to happen because developers would never make two versions of their game just to get a little bit more power out of the PS4 Pro. It's just too expensive. And that's true, but it's a little bit of a misunderstanding of how game development works. See, we don't make a million different versions of our games to run on a million different specs of PC, for example. We make one game with some easily scalable parts, like clipping distance or lighting quality stuff that can easily be scaled down as needed. And the world of the PS4 and the PS4.5 is going to be the same. I think you can safely consider the PS4 games of the future as PS4.5 games with their graphics settings turned down a notch, because I think that's how most devs are going to think of them. So now the real question: is this a good thing? There are parts of me that actually want to say yes. In previous console generations, console architecture changed radically with each new iteration and the underlying OS of each machine changed nearly as much. This meant that it was incredibly difficult to do things like play games from the previous machine's library on the new powerful machine - which, of course, won't be an issue here. It also meant that companies had to manufacture a completely new machine every time, scrapping all of the efficiencies of their old production pipeline and resetting much of the economy of scale that comes with producing millions of console units. But here, Sony can instead simultaneously focus on making the PS4 cheaper to produce and making the 4.5 better. This essentially means that the original PS4 will shift to being sort of the entry-level console in the market. Don't have the money for a PS4.5 right now? Consider the PS4 instead. Or, maybe you're not yet sure that games are your thing, but there's this one game that all your friends want you to try. Well, pick up a PS4. It'll cost you less. I mean, I've known many people who didn't really play games, but then stumbled onto one PC game that they just loved, and the next time they wanted to buy a PC, they went for a much beefier gaming-focused device and soon started buying all sorts of games to play on it. Now, I'm not saying that the exact same thing is going to happen here. A PC is something that many people happen to have anyway, whereas even a starter PS4 is something that you'd have to be interested in games in the first place to get. But if Sony can focus on continuing to lower the price, It's quite possible that they could make the PS4 very competitive as a home media machine that just so happens to play games when you decide you want one. On the flip side though, I think we might start having a much mushier slide between console generations, because someday developers are just going to start making games that simply don't work on the old PS4, and yeah, there will be an outcry when it happens, but it's kind of inevitable. I mean, think of it like the PC market: at no point has anyone ever declared ""from this day forward this PC's hardware will be considered the minimum spec for all PC gaming and no new games are to be developed that require something more powerful to run. This is the floor now and forever. No one says that and it would be really weird if they did, but that's pretty much how consoles have worked for decades. Now, consoles like the PS4 might start working like the PC space, where you can keep playing new games on your original console long after the higher spec versions have been released, but as new games are made to take advantage of the new hardware, your PS4 is gonna start seeing longer load times and then maybe lower graphics settings until eventually, your poor little machine struggles to pull 30 frames per second on most games and you finally had enough and you decide to just upgrade. And in a lot of ways, this might actually be better for consumers than simply killing a console off every few years. After all, millions of old PCs can still run games like Dota 2 and WoW and Counter-Strike. Now, there will be a place for long term games like those in the Playstation universe, and a place for people who just can't afford to buy the latest gaming machine every time a new one comes out. But on the other hand, it's one more step towards consoles becoming more like PCs and one more step away from the simpler times when you put a cartridge in a box and it just worked. No OS updates, not even worrying about system specs. It's a trade-off. See you next week! "
22,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,BtY3Lto_lR4,"Previously on Extra Credits we talked about the unusual approach that Games Workshop was taking in licensing out their IP to different studios. This new strategy of theirs seemed like it would either revive the struggling company or fail spectacularly. Well, a year has now passed. And just a few weeks ago, James came to a realization: Every SINGLE game he was in the middle of playing was based on some Games Workshop IP. So I guess we better look at Warhammer again. We learned two things from James's ""accidental"" delve into the Warhammer universe. First: an intervention might be in order. But second: well basically that their plan worked; that the way Games Workshop has been licensing their IP seems to have been successful. So let's look at what they did and try to figure out why it worked. Just to recap though, what was this bold plan that Games Workshop had to license out their worlds? Basically, they licensed their IP to anybody with a pulse and a machine capable of compiling code. On its face, you can see how that might turn out very, very poorly. This could have ended in a mountain of bad games that sunk the value of their IP for years. Buuut, that didn't happen. They not only got a host of decent games like Blood Bowl and Battlefleet: Gothic Leviathan and Warhammer Quest But they also actually got a handful of really quality games like Mordheim and Vermintide and Total Warhammer (which, by the way, that is what that game is called, don't anyone dare try to tell me it isn't). But, OK, why did this work? Well, first of all, not all of the licensed Games Workshop games WERE hits, but I'm guessing you don't really remember those. You're probably aware of at least a few of the pretty good games I mentioned before, but what about Snotling Fling, Doomwheel, Storm of Vengeance If any of those do ring a bell, I bet you haven't given any of those games thought in a very very long time. And that is by design. The first key to the Games Workshop's shotgun approach to licensing seems to be Sublicensing Sublicensing is the fine art of taking a BiiiG property and breaking off all the little things that you might conceivably license from it as separate IPs. Often, this is done in broad strokes. Like how The Silmarillion is technically a different license than the Lord of the Rings. Or how all the Marvel characters were licensed separately and often to different studios. (At least until Disney consolidated them.) But the folks at Games Workshop are going buck wild with this. If you look at those subpar games that I listed before, notice how... two of those are licenses for just a single Warhammer unit. One solitary unit from a game with literally hundreds of them. That is like taking the Lord of the Rings license, and breaking off the... Farmer Maggot character into his own solo license for some studio to try to build a game around. It's kind of brilliant in a way. Because if you look at all the Warhammer brand games that have come out, it appears that Games Workshop gives the really small, inconsequential licenses to studios that they aren't 100% confident in. That way if the studio blows it, well... then Games Workshop just lets that game quietly vanish into obscurity and their brands doesn't take that much of a hit. But if I were to wager a guess, I would bet that they tell all of those studios that if they nail it, they'll be given a meatier piece of the Warhammer license next time. And this allows Games Workshop to try studios out. Embracing the successes and leaving the failures to wither without much cost. So that's what's happening with the small licenses. The medium-sized ones go to teams that Games Workshop knows can deliver, but they aren't mega studios. These mid-size licenses might be something chunky like a Spacemarine chapter, but just as often there'll be some expansion or a spin-off that has its own unique feel. These are your Blood Bowls and your Vermintides. This allows Games Workshop to get a variety of products, without those games competing too much with each other mechanically or thematically. And then the core licenses: 40k and Warhammer Fantasy Battle. Those go to the AAA studios who are able to go big and make stuff like Total Warhammer and Dawn of War. We should also talk about Games Workshop's marketing approach though, because they know that the popularity of their IP will automatically create some initial visibility for all of these games, without heavy marketing investment. And that allows them to wait and see how a title is initially received before investing more money marketing it. You'll notice that almost all of their low- and mid-tier licenses... They don't seem to get much of a push unless they look like they're gonna do really well. And even then, that push comes way later in the cycle than usual, sometimes not until after launch. Moreover that push comes through Games Workshop's existing marketing channels like their stores or their magazine, and not through Games Workshop spending any additional money. This allows them to save their marketing muscle for the titles they know are good, or at least the ones they know are gonna appeal to their audience. And they let the rest just quietly slide into oblivion. Because the Warhammer licenses are just that darn huge and widely known this approach seems to be working. And, actually, let's talk about that IP. One of the advantages things like Fantasy Battle and 40k have is that they are incredibly fleshed out properties. Between the games, the books, the game books, and the miniatures, Games Workshop IP has hundreds of characters and locations at their disposal, all of them packed with detail and flavor, and with a lot of established mechanics. This pre-existing depth not only gives Games Workshop the ability to sublicense down to the micro level like they do, but also provides a detailed blueprint for any company working with their IP, which reduces the risk of companies producing conflicting or disjointed games under those licenses. More than that though, this pre-existing depth also provides an interesting reinforcing effect to their shotgun-style licensing. Having such a broad and robustly built out set of universes means that each game can serve as a rabbit hole leading towards the others. It's a lot like the Marvel Universe effect: Each product introduces you to and gets you excited about some of the others. But the final piece of this puzzle is IP quality control. Not GAME quality control, mind you, quality control of the IP Itself. The quality of the games may vary pretty wildly, but IP quality control helps to ensure that everything published under that IP stays true to that IP. And Games Workshop is very good at this. I think GW probably realized very early on that they had neither the capacity nor the resources to micromanage every one of these projects into being good. But what they did have was a large number of people who are very intimately familiar with the worlds and the lore of their own tabletop games. And when you look at the slew of Warhammer titles that have come out, it looks like Games Workshop is putting that strength to use. Because even the bad Warhammer games still have that proper Warhammer flavor. Games Workshop may not be able to control the quality of all those games, but they almost certainly asked for final approval on how everything looked and felt. And this means that even when people hated one of those licensed games, that hate is much less likely to transfer over to actual Games Workshop products. Heck, if they're lucky, anybody who plays a bad Games Workshop license product will say to themselves: ""Well that was disappointing. I want to play a good game set in this universe."" All of which leads to more sales for their core games, more people knowing about their universe, and the value of their IP increasing. So it would seem that this shotgun approach to licensing where even the smallest dev has a chance at working with a tiny splinter of this major IP... It can be effective. It requires some very specific variables from the company and from the IP itself, so it's not an option for most companies; but it does mean that for a company like Games Workshop, licensing exclusively to AAA companies for enormous fees isn't the only option anymore. We'll see you next week. "
23,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,FzdylKgPjNI,"So, Japanese media has this, I guess, tradition? It tends to sprinkle in something that we don't really have a good word for in English, other than, I guess, ""perviness."" But, of late, I've seen a few Japanese games play with that tradition and try to subvert it. And some have done this really well. Some, not as much. [Intro theme] The Japanese language has a handful of words describing a concept that, again, we really don't have proper terminology for in English. These are words like ""hentai,"" or, its milder derivative, ""ecchi."" They essentially mean ""lewd"" or ""perverted,"" but they don't come with quite the same baggage that those words do in English. This hentai sensibility can range from relatively innocuous double entendres to the more disturbing or uncomfortable moments, like the accidental boob grab, looking up a girl's skirt, or spying on them while they're bathing, accidentally or otherwise. Now, obviously, Japan doesn't hold a monopoly on panderingly-sexualized content - we do plenty of that here at home as well - but this particular tradition has become a well-trodden trope in Japanese media, and Japanese games have featured their share of these moments. But, interestingly, I've noticed a few Japanese games lately that are consciously exploring this trope and subverting it: calling attention to, or steering away from, the leering and non-consensual aspects of this stuff, and instead using zany humor or context to make it easier for us to discuss and question the things which society has taught us are embarrassing to talk about. Today, I want to talk about two games: one that does this well, and one that does this poorly. Let's start with the example of this done well: Yakuza 0, of all things. I am as surprised as you are to be citing Yakuza for this, but it's their zany tenor and soap opera earnestness that give them such an ideal place to approach this from. Or maybe it was just that somebody on the dev team was really on the ball about approaching these pervy moments tactically. Very minor spoilers ahead. We have to start with Mr. Libido. In Yakuza 0, there's this collection mechanic where you basically collect trading cards of real-life Japanese porn stars. Very real women, who have little or nothing to do with the game, are turned into literal objects and then scattered around the town for you to find and collect. It's the exact sort of stupid, sexually-pandering feature that we've seen in numerous games before. But then comes the subversion. What do you get as your reward for collecting all these cards? Well, you get to interact with Mr. Libido, the game's most ridiculous character. Mr. Libido is a wacky, even more over-the-top than usual rendition of the pathetic horndog trope, and he is the game holding a mirror in the player's face to basically say: ""Congratulations. This is you."" All Mr. Libido wants to do is look at these cards and fantasize about the women on them, and the game is basically suggesting that if you, too, are all excited to collect these fairly tame images of real-life porn stars, you are Mr. Libido. It's a clever subversion that's funny, on point, and successful in ribbing you for spending hours hunting scantily-clad lady cards rather than doing all the other fun stuff the game has to offer. It's not especially mean about it, but, it's meant to make you realize how silly and juvenile this activity is, both in this game and in all the other games that feature this sort of thing. Then there's the scene where a literal child asks you to buy porn for him. This is played for humor, with the joke basically being, isn't it funny that a grown man is buying porn for a prepubescent boy alone in the street? So, okay, that's the pervy bit, but then the game actually goes and makes this a really endearing story that asks us to consider what actually matters here. Yakuza's main character, Kazuma, was an orphan. He grew up always being let down by adults, or feeling like they always lied to him, and he has carried that weight all of his life. When this child asks Kazuma if he'll buy a magazine for him, Kazuma naturally says, ""yes,"" on the condition that the child goes home afterward, cause the street's not a safe place for a kid alone. Then Kazuma realizes that the kid is asking for a porn magazine. The child doesn't even realize what the magazine is. He just thinks it must be amazing, cause it's the only magazine he's ever seen that people apparently think is important enough to protect by sealing in plastic. Then, after Kazuma tries to convince the child that he shouldn't get it, the child starts to cry, and talks about how grown-ups always lie to him. So now, this semi-pervy scenario has turned into an interesting choice: do you let this child feel the same hurt that Kazuma grew up with, or do you just get him the stupid magazine? In the end, Kazuma decides that it'll do far less harm if he just buys the thing for the kid. Better than teaching him that adults can't be trusted. Oh, and then actually procuring the magazine is this adorable little stealth mini-game, because your main character's embarrassed to be seen buying porn. Then there's the dominatrix. This one's really just about bringing in aspects of sexuality that not everyone might feel totally familiar or comfortable with. Now, usually, these scenarios are played for laughs, as an opportunity to mockingly say, ""Isn't this weird? Everyone laugh at the weirdos."" But that's not what's happening here at all. The humor here plays completely differently. The comedy here is, instead, that the professional dominatrix is simply too shy and polite to be good at her job. In fact, that's why she took the job: to be more outspoken and confident. So, your character has to let her practice her craft on you until she gains the confidence to do it well. And the best part of this is that it humanizes her. They're not making her a one-dimensional character played off for comedy, because, boy, isn't the idea of a woman dominating a man funny, ha ha ha? And they're not mocking her for being a sex worker, either. Instead, you get to see her insecurities. And the humor is in the fact that being a nice person in this scenario means participating in BDSM roleplay and giving her tips on what you think a male client might want from a dominatrix. Instead of framing all of this as disgusting or weird, this sequence makes BDSM and everybody involved seem human and normal. And there is plenty more of this in Yakuza that I could talk about, like the host cafe mini-game where they try to humanize some of the hosts, or the 30 or so ultra-softcore live action videos that they made specifically for the game, which are just embarrassingly bad, though I'm not sure that the subversion's quite so successful there. But there's one other game that I wanted to bring up here: Persona 5. Again, some pretty small spoilers here. Now, I have spent a lot of time with the Persona games, and Persona 5 is great in a lot of ways, but, I think they stumbled pretty hard in playing with this trope. And it's really a bummer, because they start out so strong with an arc that's cognizant of the worst aspects of this trope. The boss of the first dungeon is the signature hentai character: the leering man who runs around in his underwear. And the story surrounding this dungeon revolves around sexual harassment, physical and sexual abuse, and sexual coercion from a position of power, and it treats all of those evils with the gravity they deserve. But, then, in the very next dungeon, the game just completely faceplants by having this whole bit where one of your characters is being pressured into doing nude art modeling. And the whole situation is presented as, ""Isn't this funny? Cause she's gonna have to get naked even though she doesn't want to."" This is the same character that was just the victim of threatening sexual advances from her teacher. It is cringe worthy. There's even this moment where her two male friends tell her that she should just go through with it. They even pressure her into doing so for the sake of the team, rather than finding some other, alternate solution to the problem. Heck, your main character's even given a dialogue choice where all of the options basically boil down to making her feel bad if she doesn't strip. Then there's this other moment where you find out that your homeroom teacher moonlights as a hostess, and your main character functionally threatens to blackmail her for sex. And, of course, there's an option to romance her without any discussion of the power dynamics in a student-teacher relationship, or, what, even in many Japanese prefectures would be considered an underage relationship. It makes everything that happened in the first castle just feel like lip service. Like, the team wanted their game to deal in serious issues, to impress us with how aware and conscientious it was with these things, but they didn't have the dedication to properly explore or subvert those old tropes every time they fell back on them. Persona 5 ends up being a perfect example of the other side of this coin, of the awful stuff that your game can unwittingly normalize if this hentai sensibility goes unexamined. Again, there is a lot to like about Persona 5, but it's really important that we don't just shrug off that kind of gross misstep. If nothing else, Persona 5 shows us just how very aware we have to be of what our content is actually saying. And, don't misunderstand me, I am absolutely not suggesting that we should be afraid of using sexual humor. There is a fine and longstanding tradition of bawdy comedy that goes back just about as far as humans have had the ability to write. Some of the best of it even forces us to examine ourselves and really carefully think about the moral systems we may have grown up with, leaving us to either question them or knowingly embrace them. But there's a fine line between racy humor and leering objectification. Yakuza 0 convinced me that this type of hentai humor can be used for good, and Persona 5 showed me just how valuable it can be to start a serious discussion about the harmful side of such behavior, even though it it stumbles into glorifying that same behavior barely hours later. Overall, games like these have made me cognizant of just how careful with we have to be with this particular aesthetic, to make sure that we aren't celebrating sexual acts without consent, violations of privacy, or pressuring people into sexual things that they're not comfortable with. That's not a thing you want your game to normalize. See you next week. (End music) "
24,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,GOVrmfXolQg,"So, for a few months now, we've been fascinated by what's going on with the Games Workshop licensing. James talked about it a bit on James Recommends back when that was a thing, but it's so interesting from a games business perspective that we figured we talk about it here, and a special thank you to our pal LeeLee for returning to help as our guest artist this week. Yay LeeLee! For those of you who aren't in to Games Workshop games like Warhammer or Blood Bowl or 40k, don't worry; this episode is less about specific games and more about one's approach to taking physical IP and making it digital. What's really fascinating here is that there are basically two main ways to think about licensing, and Games Workshop has moved from one of those ways directly to its polar opposite. In fact, it has done so so drastically and with such rapidity that it makes it the perfect example case for us to follow. Now I should say before we dig into this: we are not here to make any judgments on the Games Workshop games. James swears that if he retires before he dies we are all going to have an EC Blood Bowl league. And we aren't here to judge their business practices either. They know their business far better than we do, and they may well be making the right calls. This is just a look at a rare in-practice example of two different theories on licensing. So let's look at that example. Now, a lot of this is educated guesswork, but here's how I see it. Throughout the 90s, Games Workshop dabbled in licensing their games, mostly working with SSI Mindscape until the demise of SSI around 2000. These were the halcyon days of tabletop gaming. Magic the Gathering had vastly expanded the playerbase, hobby game stores were popping up everywhere, White Wolf had brought darker, grittier experiences to the fore, it was a golden time for Games Workshop, so their core business was clearly their focus. Now it's my guess that back in the mid-90s, Games Workshop gave SSI Mindscape a fairly exclusive license to their two main universes, Warhammer and Warhammer 40k. But when SSI Mindscape fell apart, the license probably reverted to Games Workshop, and they realized that the value of their intellectual property had grown a great deal in the last half dozen years. So they went out looking for much bigger game companies to partner with, and here is where our story begins. Many of you probably remember the Dawn of War series, and perhaps even the elegantly titled Warhammer 40k Space Marine for the Xbox 360 and PS3. Now these were some decent games, some better than others, but all with fairly high production values, and all seemed to at least be trying to do more than simply cash in on the Warhammer license. They were also all THQ games. When Games Workshop got their license back from SSI, from the looks of it, it appears they made an exclusive deal with THQ, handing them the keys to ""the Warhammer 40k universe"". (And note that I say ""universe"" here, because that's going to come up again later.) Now there seems to have been some sort of agreement that the strategic goal here was to grow the value of the core Warhammer 40k license by turning out solid games, thereby benefiting both companies in the long term. The games were an end in and of themselves, rather than just an advertising vehicle  for the other Games Workshop products. The games could be revenue generators  for Games Workshop by themselves, and if they were good enough long enough, they could probably lead some players back toward the tabletop games. OK, now hop forward 10 years. THQ collapses for a host of other reasons. This time, though, Games Workshop takes the exact opposite ideological approach to licensing. You may have noticed the recent slew of mobile and downloadable games that have been tied to Games Workshop franchises, all of them from different developers, all of them with wildly varying standards of production and gameplay quality. Instead of giving an exclusive license to one developer and setting a high bar of quality, Games Workshop now appears to be aiming broad. Remember how I mentioned that the THQ license was probably for the Warhammer 40k universe? Well, it looks like they've been chopping up the license, no longer handing out the universe as a whole, but rather licensing specific campaigns, marine chapters and tabletop game spin-off separately to allow more game companies to work on their products at once. So why the about-face? From a consumer perspective, it may seem like having a smaller number of developers who the license holder can work with to ensure very high quality standards is the way to go. And from a long-term IP value perspective I'm inclined to agree. But we might be wrong here. Which is what makes the Games Workshop licensing so fascinating. Watching how things turn out for them will inform our thinking on licensing in the future. So back to the question: Why the about-face? Well first off the Hobby game market simply is not as strong as it was back when Games Workshop made their deal with THQ. Games Workshop has been struggling a bit of late. Their stock has been in a slump, and they've had some shake ups in management. This undoubtedly plays a part in the recent change in their licensing approach. And one potential answer is that they need to bring in some short-term revenue. Giving out as many licenses as quickly as possible to teams who are working on games which can be developed in as short a time frame as possible certainly does more for short-term revenue than working with one large partner who might not get a game to market for two or three years. But let's look at the other ramifications. Part of this strategy could be a return to using video games to drive their core products. If their table top sales are slipping, the idea may be simply to use the video game tie-ins as advertisements. If you can get as many disparate games out there as possible, and if they represent a broader swath of the products you sell, you may be able to bring more people into the core games you yourself develop. Even with a bad licensed video game, you may get players who say: ""I really love the world, but I just wish this game was better."" Who then stumble upon the better games that title was based on. And, in the long run, they may just not care about the value of their IP in the video game world as much. The bad products may reduce the value of their IP on the video game side of things, but if you're Games Workshop and you decide that video games just aren't your core business, and they're not where you're going to pivot to in the near future, then you don't really care about reducing the value of your license there. And licensing the game to other people, even at a cut rate, is essentially getting them to make big interactive ads for you on their own dime. It might also function as a vetting process: if you don't know what developers you want to work with in the long run, you could always let a few dozen of them take a crack at your license and use that to find the best ones to work with in the future. This is actually kind of brilliant but my worry here is in how the sub licenses are divied up. After licensing so many parts of the Warhammer and 40k worlds, I have no idea if they have the legal capacity to give an exclusive license to that universe anymore if they find a developer they really want to work with. This decision could also be based on confidence in their core audience. They may have decided that no number of bad video games is going to make a Warhammer table top player stop playing the tabletop game. Therefore their risk is essentially zero. And if any of these games bring in a new audience or turn out to be a miraculous hit, then win-win for them. Or, last possibility, they might just have come to the conclusion that the shotgun approach is simply better: that the bad games won't stick in people's minds for very long but the great games will; so if they'd just fire off a ton of games, they're more likely to get a few surprise hits, and the value of those surprise hits will outweigh the loss of any horrifically bad games that happen to get churned out, because a hit will be seen by a lot of people while the terrible games will probably only in bitter of a few. So whatever their reasoning, this new, broader, slightly less quality focused approach is not arbitrary. There is rationale behind it. And this is why I'm so curious to see where it leads them in a few years because I really don't know what tactic is right. And this experiment comes at an interesting time, a time when major license holders like DC and Hasbro and Lego have come to realize that their brands NEED games that are about reinforcing how awesome the brand is. Is that better achieved by opening up the fire hose? Or by carefully hand-picking the developers you're going to work with and choosing what products ever see the light of day? To find that out, I think we had all best keep an eye on Games Workshop. See you next week! "
25,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,HU7lCCmOdgk," Sometimes we spend so much time making games talking about games and making shows about making games Not to mention history mythology and sci-fi shows that we forget to make time to play games so today for extra credits's 400TH EPISODE I know it's crazy!

26,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,HjGTQrsUOKM,"Hello, everybody! Happy holidays and welcome to this little holiday special. ♫ Intro Music ♫ As per usual, the extra credits channel is going to be taking some time off for the holiday. This has been our busiest year by far and a lot of us are beyond exhausted. So, as of the 20th (give or take), we're going to be taking a break until mid-January in order to recover. Now, I know that's a long hiatus, but fear not! It turns out that this internet is full-to-bursting with intelligent and/or entertaining people whom you can enjoy in our absence, and I have put together a list of them for you: three of them, in fact. Today, tomorrow, and the day after, I'm going to list off just some of my personal favorite channels, writers, critics, and entertainers on YouTube and the internet at large. Now, a lot of these recommendations are hardly obscure: chances are you've probably heard of many of these people, and you might be fans of them already, but I'm willing to bet that there will be at least one name on this list that you have not heard before, and some of these channels definitely deserve more traffic than they're currently getting. So, if you find yourself missing the games discussion, design analysis, and whatever else it is we do at extra credits, I recommend trying some of these on for size. I'll be putting links to all of these down in the description. Here we go! First up: Game Makers Toolkit If you like Design Club, you are going to love Game Makers Toolkit. This exceptionally well-produced video series by Mark Brown takes a practical approach to studying game design: breaking down and studying design elements from various games, and seeing what can be learned from their successes or failures. Sometimes he'll focus on a specific aspect of one particular game, like Super Mario 3D World's four-step level design philosophy, or the value of repetition to a game like Hitman. Other times he'll take a common design concept or a problem and examine how different developers took different approaches to solving that same problem. For example: how do different games handle their health mechanic, and how do those various approaches influence how the games are played? How do different games handle death and failure states, and how does that fundamentally alter the gameplay experience? He's also started a mini-series on the evolution of dungeon design in the Legend of Zelda series called Boss Keys. It is a massive undertaking, but it has been fantastic so far. Really all of his videos are great, so just-  just go watch everything. How Did They Do That? Have you ever wondered how certain classic games achieved their impressive-for-the-time graphics and technical tricks despite major hardware limitations? You're gonna like this series then. There aren't a lot of episodes, but each one clearly and concisely explains the tricks and the technology that these early 3D games used to look as cool as they did. You want to know how Banjo Kazooie's dynamic music worked? Or Final Fantasy VII's pre-rendered backgrounds? Or Link's expressive eyes in Twilight Princess? How about the irregular gravity in Mario Galaxy games? Learn for yourself, and learn it from an Indie Dev who would know. Errant Signal As valuable as the traditional buyer's-guide format of game reviewing is, this is the sort of literary critique that I've been excited to see more of in recent years: the kind that's less concerned with whether a piece of art is worth your money, and more concerned with what that piece of art says, and what cultural significance it might have. Chris has been putting out videos for about five years now, digging into Triple-A and Indie game alike, and I always leave his discussion feeling like I understand the game just a little bit better than I did before. These are a few of my personal favorite episodes of his, but go dig into his backlog yourself: just click on whatever topic grabs you first. Noah Gervais I only recently discovered Noah's channel, but I absolutely adore his long-form franchise retrospectives. Noah's standard approach is to take a bird's-eye view of a series, looking back on a franchises entire history: examining where each game stumbles or triumphs within the context of the larger body of work; seeing how the vision and execution of a series of games evolves over time as technology advances, as creative leadership changes hands, as audience tastes change. And this guy is thorough. He will spend an hour and 15 minutes on the System Shock and Bioshock games; an hour and 45 minutes on the Mafia trilogy; two hours contrasting the single-player campaigns of the Call of Duty series; two-and-a-half hours discussing the Mass Effect trilogy. Every episode is equal parts retrospective nostalgia and fresh insight. And I just love his presentation style as well: the way he does his opening titles, the little recording and editing imperfections peppered throughout each video, the cadence of his narration... Aesthetically, it's reminiscent of every contemporary literature professor I had in college, and, it is just so charming. So: pick an episode about a series of games you like, put on some tea, and settle in for a thoroughly pleasant time. Super Bunnyhop Like the previous two channels on this list, Super Bunnyhop deals in game criticism and editorial, but the format of his content is not so easily categorized Peruse his library of episodes and you will find a pretty wide spectrum of gaming-centric essays, from reviews, to retrospectives, to some pieces that border on journalism: like this episode on the creative talent developing Sonic Mania, or that one episode investigating Konami just as their working relationship with Kojima was falling apart (which Konami infamously tried and ultimately failed to remove from YouTube). Some of my personal favorite episodes include: this one examining the first level of every sonic game, this look at Bloodborne through the lens of Lovecraft, and this massive series of critiques on the Metal Gear games (because he's a huge Metal Gear nerd and I think I might be too, and this Metal Gear Solid 3 one in particular is just one of my favorite things... I-  Man I love that game). Watch his videos: he's good. Innuendo Studios If you've seen any of Ian's videos before, I'm guessing you either saw his video about Phil Fish and the consequences of internet fame, maybe this series about the irrational swell of anger directed toward prominent feminist voices in the game community, or possibly this excellent video explaining the beauty of Smash Bros Melee as a spectator sport. (And if you haven't seen that one, you really should 'cuz it's- just- it's- excellent.) He's got a lot of other great videos too though, and they don't have nearly as many views for reasons that I do not entirely understand. Like this video on the role of Kenny's character in the Walking Dead games, or this examination of Davey Wreden's The Beginner's Guide (which might be my favorite video from Ian, so far). Give him a look! And finally for today: Ask A Game Dev This one isn't a Youtube channel but rather a daily Q&amp;A blog written by a game dev. veteran. As you probably well know the gaming industry can be frustratingly opaque sometimes, but because this blog's writer has chosen to remain anonymous, they're free to speak candidly about how games get made, and why the industry does what it does. What's a typical day like for a developer? How do you become one? What's with the season passes, pre-orders, and microtransactions in Triple-A games? What is it that makes games cost so much to make? And why is the game industry so darn secretive to begin with? Ask a game Dev answers all of these questions, and many, many, many more in detail every week. They're pretty great. Go read some. Well, that ought to do it for now. Join me tomorrow and I will have a fresh batch of new recommendations for you. Until then! ♫ Music ♫ (“Russian Bonetrousle” by Jose Daniel Ruiz) "
27,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,JnP2boSC-FM,"Why are there no great video game movies? This is a question we hear a lot, and given that we're less than a year out from an Assassin's Creed movie, and man, only a few months away  from a Warcraft movie, we're probably going to be hearing this question asked a lot more in the near future. Or, maybe one or both of those will turn out to be really good. I mean, stranger things have happened. [Intro Music] Now, film is not our main area of critical expertise, So, we have called in our good friend, Movie Bob, to give us his thoughts. Today's episode is pretty much thanks to him, and I highly recommend checking out his channel after this. I'll link to it at the end. The problem with questions like, ""Why are there no great video game movies,"" is that they don't really have one answer. Making any movie is really, really hard work, regardless of whether it's an original idea or an adaptation. And even projects that sound absolutely perfect on paper frequently turn out to be... not. At first glance, the most obvious answer would seem to be That games and movies are just too different as media. Interactive versus passive storytelling, Player focused versus audience focused, Linear versus open narrative progression and so on. But while I'm sure that that has some to do with it, I actually don't think it's the main issue. And honestly, I think it's somewhat overstated. I mean, yes, games work differently than movies do, but so do books, and plays, and songs. And they have made plenty of great movies out of those. Heck, they've even made movies out of board games. Not many good movies, but still. Basically, if there is a story being told, or even just a compelling visual or a theme that a story could be married to, You can probably make a movie out of it- if you want to. And that's probably the more pressing concern. Not enough of the people with the money or the power in the film industry to make these kinds of decisions are familiar enough with the games medium. Remember, video games have only been widely popular in mainstream culture for a relatively short amount of time, especially in the West. By contrast, ""The Lord of the Rings"" was one of the most popular works in western literature For nearly half a century before it got a proper movie. It's easy to think of modern Hollywood as just going down a spreadsheet And looking for whatever might make money, But a lot of it still comes down to directors and producers and studio executives Making decisions based mostly on their own instincts and personal preferences. Like, here's a good example. When Tim Burton's first Batman movie came out in 1989, it was a massive box office hit. And that told Hollywood that comic book superheroes were something audiences wanted to see. But instead of responding with movies about, say, Spider-Man or Wonder Woman or Captain America, Studios greenlit features about older, By then, less popular characters from the pulp and the newspaper strip era, Like Dick Tracy and the Shadow and the Phantom. Why did they do that? Well, possibly because the folks in charge didn't really know much about comics beyond the fact That those were the kinds of comic book heroes who had made money as movies in the past. But of course those new versions performed mostly poorly when they came out. Meanwhile, some studios did try to look for what was actually popular. But since they were mainly working from sales figures rather than first-hand understanding, They passed right over the properties with proven long-term viability, In favor of heroes who turned out to be short-lived fads. In other words, it's no accident that we didn't get the present day renaissance of comic book movies Until a generation of film professionals who grew up during that mediums popularity explosion Was firmly established in positions of industry power. And as the gaming generation comes into its own, it's pretty likely that video game movies will at least try to follow a similar trajectory. So the question then becomes: When it's time to get serious about making video games into movies what does that actually mean? And not just in terms of which games do we make movies out of, But in terms of what kinds of movies do we wanna make of them. What story do we wanna tell, and how? Because one thing that does set games apart from other media Is that the story isn't always the core of the appeal. And I'm not talking about a lack of originality or complexity either. Even some of gaming's simplest stories endure Precisely because they're grounded in classical narrative frameworks, Like a mission to rescue a loved one from captivity, Or the relationship of children and animals, Or tensions between humanity and our technological creations, Or war, or revenge, or family. No, I'm talking about how caring about the story isn't always necessary to love a game. Like how many people played through the early Zeldas without really embracing the mythos. Or how you can become a master at ""Street Fighter"" Without ever bothering to learn why any of these people are punching each other. This is a strength to the accessibility of games But it has also contributed to a skewed hierarchy of priorities in design culture Where some of our most visually unique or mechanically satisfying games Find themselves stuck with stories mainly cobbled together from retreads of earlier familiar media And that presents a challenge for any movie adaptation. Look at how ""Resident Evil"" movies had to invent an entirely new main character just to help differentiate it From all the previous zombie and monster movies the games had liberally borrowed from. But even that doesn't necessarily have to be a hindrance. You see, there actually has been at least one good movie based on a game: ""Clue."" Now, if you haven't seen ""Clue""... well, go se ""Clue."" It's a really, really great comedy, and the cast is terrific. But what's truly impressive about the film is the way it manages to faithfully adapt the source material, Even as it transforms it for an entirely new medium. ""Clue"" is a relatively simple board game where players take turns trying to solve a mystery, Through process of elimination and educated guessing. And in order to keep things compelling, the board, the pieces, and the overall scenario, Are all based around tropes and stock characters familiar from old detective stories, Which effectively means that simply playing a game of ""Clue"" tells a story, Complete with a hero, a villain, a supporting cast, an inciting incident, and an ending. And one of the things that make the ""Clue"" movie so unique and great is that it pulls from the very mechanics, The very play of the game by being a movie that was released with multiple different endings, Making it a dynamic mystery in fashion of the game itself. It takes all the names and ideas and iconography that make the game memorable, Recreates a sense of why the game is fun in the first place, And (where necessary) it adds a few elements to round things out. It might not be a perfect model for every situation, But it's at least a blueprint for how this idea could be accomplished. But here's another thought: What if there is something about a game worth adapting outside of its story or characters? We know that cinematic techniques like atmospheric music, And manipulation of camera angles and shot composition have all been used to enrich games. But why can't the same be true of techniques unique to our medium? Consider, for example, ""Call of Duty."" No, for real. Hear me out. People may enjoy ""Call of Duty"" singleplayer campaigns, but basically nobody plays the series for the storylines. In fact, a big chunk of the fanbase is primarily or only interested in the multiplayer. But that franchise has an enormous presence in the popular culture, Even among people who don't play or follow games. And that presence is that ""Call of Duty"" is synonymous with war from a first person viewpoint. So why not make that movie? What if ""Call of Duty: The Movie"" didn't just slap the franchise branding onto a generic military action film? What if it instead used the stylistic perspective associated with the games To tell a war story in first person through the eyes of an individual soldier, To put the audience directly into the experience of armed service. And not just for combat scenes, like the games, but also for smaller experiences: basic training, deployment, briefings, patrols, long nights of fear and uncertainty, brief moments of levity, The making and losing of friends, victory, defeat, pain, loss, injury, maybe even death. Think about the intensely human drama and nerve-wracking thrills that a film could create By showing you that from directly behind the eyes of someone experiencing it first-hand. But also, think about what that could say and mean to a civilian audience That's increasingly disconnected from the duty it asks of those who do enlist. In the rights hands, something like that could not only be powerful cinema, But also, thoughtful and important. And those are two words not often associated with that franchise. But that's just one idea. For all the talk of games and movies being rival media, Or a bad influence on one another, At the end of the day, not every one of them's going anywhere. They share the same culture, and despite differing approaches, They ultimately share the same goals within that culture. To entertain, to inspire, to enlighten, to provide an escape, and sometimes, even to teach. And they both have a lot to learn from one another, Far beyond merely borrowing each other's characters. I believe we're only just beginning to see a future where both mediums have evolved and transformed In fascinating ways, through an exchange of influence and ideas, And they're gonna be thrilling, informing, and telling a story using ways we can hardly begin to imagine today, And I believe it's gonna be a truly exciting time to be a gamer and a movie lover, Even if you gotta endure a few more bad movies to get there. Thank you again, Bob, for the help with today's episode, and I will see you guys next week. Thanks for watching! [outro music plays] "
28,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,NEpeGSFQ1tM," Last week, we talked about Overwatch's asymmetric level design, and all the complexities of balancing an attacker versus defender type map that funnels teams down a carefully designed path. But you can't talk about asymmetric balance and Overwatch without bringing up the other major factor at play: Overwatch's asymmetric heroes. Overwatch's characters are wildly asymmetric, with a huge variety in play styles, offensive abilities and mobility options. So not only do Overwatch's designers have to design their levels around the asymmetry of attack and defense, but they also have to build them so that there are interesting tactical options for every character. Pharah and Winston need walls to leap over. Widowmaker needs advantageous sniper positions to grapple to. Tracer needs good flanking routes. Reaper needs good flanking positions to teleport to. Lucio and Genji need walls that are tactically useful to traverse. The snipers need good sight lines, the offense heroes need useful cover, the turrets need good defensive points. There are so many factors to consider! And once the designers have created these features, they also have to make sure that none of them are exploitable by characters that aren't supposed to get to them. And then the designers have to do that for both teams, so that whether you're on attack or defense, no matter which direction you're headed on the map, there's always interesting map features for every character to take advantage of. When this is done well, it makes every character feel special and unique to play. When you're at one of those points that only your character can really take advantage of, it feels downright heroic. But in terms of design this comes with a cost: more complexity. Map knowledge is important in all first-person shooters. It takes the player longer to learn asymmetric maps, because, well, there's just more variations in the map to learn. In Overwatch, this is only compounded by the variety of characters and movement styles that the maps have to accommodate. Of course, that's not to say that this was a wrong decision by the design team. In fact, it's part of what gives the game its depth. But this is one of the trade-offs you have to accept with this type of wildly asymmetric design. This also raises another interesting question, though: will Blizzard have to revamp these maps for every character they create? What if some new Overwatch hero has an entirely different mobility style that allows them to traverse each map in ways that no other character can? Every map in the game would probably need at least some slight tweaking, to make sure that this new hero had plenty of traversal options without being grossly overpowered. That makes character creation even more expensive, and that expense would only be compounded by the release of additional maps down the line. Of course, there are other ways to limit this, by creating characters that have roughly the same movement styles and roles as existing characters, but that kind of clashes with one of Overwatch's greatest strengths, which is character diversity. Ultimately, this added development cost isn't necessarily a bad trade-off, because interesting maps are a huge part of what makes interesting FPS gameplay, but the extra cost built into every character does mean that new characters will probably roll out more slowly. Finally, there's one more way character asymmetry can affect a map design: conflicting player types. What do I mean by this? Well, as a designer, You always have to consider who's actually playing your game, and Overwatch presents a particularly thorny problem. Because someone designing those maps has to ask themselves: ""Am I designing this for pickup groups, or am I designing this for pre-made teams?"" Because there's a huge difference in designing a play space that's fun for a well-oiled machine, versus one that's fun for a grab bag of randos. One of these teams coordinates their composition and positioning with great care. Their Torbjörn has a turret in the optimal position at the match's start. Their Reinhardt is already standing by to block incoming sniper fire, while their Widowmaker is watching the sky for any of those pesky enemy Pharahs who might be considering raining down some unwelcome justice. Meanwhile, the other team has three Reapers, two dangerously unqualified Hanzos, and one poor Mercy who somehow has to keep this school field trip alive. These are very different teams of players, and they require very different map design approaches, and you can feel that tension in Overwatch's map design. Because Blizzard can't really afford to leave either group behind if they want Overwatch to compete with the other big FPS games on the scene, like CS:GO or TF2 or Call of Duty. That said, I do sense that Blizzard is leaning more towards producing for coordinated teams, perhaps with the hope that some meta will take hold, like it has in the MOBA world, or even like you see happening to a much smaller degree in TF2. Or perhaps their hope that they can use the character difficulty level to solve this problem, and simply build more interesting uncoordinated brawl spaces for the simpler characters. In the end, though, Overwatch is an interesting game to study as a designer thinking about asymmetric map design, because that team clearly has the resources to do this right, and they've sort of turned all the advantages and disadvantages of asymmetric map creation up to 11. They've created maps that use the inherit imbalance of asymmetric map design to create interesting tactical options and varied combat situations, AND to try to create an actual design interest curve for their levels. But they've created an even harder balance challenge for themselves in the process. They've built in further asymmetries to provide amazing opportunities for each character from each side of the map, but in doing so, they not only made themselves vulnerable to the possibility of more game balance landmines, but also made the process of future character creation slower and more expensive. AND on top of their map asymmetry, they've embraced the asymmetry of player types, and built an amazing tactical experience for a fully assembled group into the very maps they make, but that inevitably means they're sacrificing focus on the pick up group experience. I trust Blizzard's capacity to walk the fine line that they've created for themselves, but succeed or fail, I think the rest of us have an incredible amount to learn as designers from Overwatch. Thanks for watching, we'll see you next week. "
29,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,NQAKOdZw7F8,"A few weeks ago, James was reading an article on a psychological study concerning the concept of 'enclothed cognition'. Basically, the idea that we think differently based on the clothes we wear. And it sparked all kinds of interesting thoughts on how we might apply this to games. So today, we are going to talk about what our characters wear, might affect how we play. (intro theme plays) Alright, so, enclothed cognition. What is it, specifically? What was this study James saw? Well, it was a psychological study where they took people and tested them on how well they were able to focus under differing conditions. But interestingly, the variable they were studying was: ""What happens if you hand people a lab coat, and them make them solve problems?"" And they found that wearing a lab coat actually increased people's ability to focus. Although it also decreased their lateral problem solving skills, which is rooted in yet another fascinating study which we should talk about later sometime. Being curious about these results, the researchers started to dig in and test another element of the human psyche: How we understand the clothes we wear. When people would enter the lab, the researchers would tell them that the lab had recently been under construction, and that they should wear a coat to protect their clothes. They split the people into two groups, and handed them each the same type of coat. But then they told one group that this coat was a doctor's coat, and they told the other group that it was a painter's coat. And they found that only the group which received the ""doctor's coat"" actually had the increased focus, decreased lateral thinking result. Now, I don't know how much I buy into this study's conclusions, not because the researchers didn't do a good job or because their work was flawed, but simply because the topic hasn't been studied broadly enough yet. Still, I found it fascinating to think about in terms of games. I mean, we project onto our in-game avatars, so what impact does our avatar's attire have on us and how we play? The more I thought about this, the more I realized that I think it has at least some impact on me. If I've got a group of playable characters and one of them looks like a sniper, like, say, they're wearing a ghillie suit or something that just feels sniper-ish, I'm more likely to play like a sniper when I use that character, even if they're mechanically identical to all the other characters. And if I'm playing a character with a big, heavy suit of armor, I'm more likely to play them like a tank, or even use them as the tank for my party, even if that other character that I have in the party who wears the long, flowing robes has the exact same stats and is just as viable to be the tanking character, I'll still probably choose the armored-looking guy every time. It just feels right. In fact, as I kept thinking about this, I was hit with another revelation: When I play XCOM 2, class specialization wasn't the only variable that defined how I played my characters. At the beginning of my playthrough, I got this sniper character two just totally looked like a sniper. You know those trope-y, professional assassin characters you see on TV? The one who are, like, clean-cut to the point of sociopathy, probably wearing slightly nerdy glasses and, due to all sort of weird biases I don't want to sidetrack into now, are often European? Well, this was that guy. And over the course of the game, I realized that I actually played him differently than any of my other snipers. I played him more methodically, with more attention to detail. I ended up even not giving him any of the pistol skills, which is not how I usually build my sniper characters. All because of the way he looked. And what's even crazier is that eventually, when he proved himself to be one of my most awesome soldiers, I literally had him put on shades, and it totally changed the way I played him. And I didn't even realize I had been doing that until I read this article. As game designers, we've long known about the indicative value of how we dress characters. We use character clothing as part of the UI, to indicate to players that ""this character is a sniper"" or ""this character is a tank"". But I've rarely heard discussion on whether this might psychologically affect how a player actually plays the character, in a way that goes beyond simply understanding the character's intended strategic role. This is potentially important if we're looking to increase immersion, because when players take on the role of their characters or play them as more than simply game pieces, they end up more immersed in the experience. It also might give us a subtle psychological lever, to help players get into the mindset we want them in, or to play the game in ways that might be more engaging to them. It also means that cosmetic character changes may be about more than simply expression. That's still probably the most important aspect of aesthetic choices in games, but it'd be fascinating to see a study on whether players play differently after they make certain, purely cosmetic changes to their characters. Lastly, it means we need to be aware of how our players interpret how their characters are clothed. As the second study showed, context matters. If people think they're wearing the coat of a wall painter, it affects them differently than if they think they're wearing the coat of a doctor. What might that mean in the fantastical realm games often inhabit? Suddenly, it might make quite a difference if their player contextualizes their character's getup as an Imperial Guardsman from 40k rather than the outfit of a marine from Aliens. So if you've got the budget and the resources, it might be worth asking play-testers about how they understand what their character was wearing. So when designing characters and outfits, it might be worth thinking about how you want your player to play, and keeping this idea of enclothed cognition in mind. Or it might not. There is really no data about this for games yet. It's a fascinating idea to explore, though. Now, because I'm curious, feel free to tell us below if you feel like you've ever had this experience yourself. Thanks for watching, we'll see you all next week. (music plays) "

Today, we've got to talk about ladder systems because humanity literally spends billions of hours grinding on videogame ladders, and yet they don't make any sense. This is in part due to where they came from. Many video games use a modified form of the ELO rating system, a ranking system invented by a chess master named Arpad Elo and first implemented in 1960 by the United States Chess Federation. This is important since Arpad Ehlo was trying to solve specific problems related to chess with his system, some of which work incredibly well in the world of video games, while others not so much. One of the things Elo was trying to solve was the fact that you can't really rate how well someone performed within a game of chess. It's impossibly difficult to look at every move in a chess match and to say how close each move made was to the quote, ""best move"", so you can't rate people based on how skillfully they played the game. Instead, Elo wanted to create a statistical system for comparing the only thing he felt you really could compare: raw wins and losses. This transfers over remarkably well to the world of competitive video games. In most video games finding an algorithm to automatically judge how well players played within a match is an impossibility. Not only are there too many factors to judge, but you'll never find a system that all of your players agree with, so implementing these types of systems will often just lead to more toxicity in your forums and in your game. But these systems also lead to a bigger problem: stat padding. Any system that tries to rate individual performance within a game often encourages players to do things other than win the game. After all, that player who wandered off to rack up kills while the flag is getting captured or the team is losing the base? Hot take! Not actually the best player in the game, which is why these systems that try to judge in-game skills as part of how they rate players create terrible environments for team play. But that leads us to the other side of the Elo rating. While Elo does help us avoid players just trying the stat pad, the Elo system itself was specifically designed for a 1v1 game. It's great for things like solo fighting games or Hearthstone, but in team games where you're not always playing with the same teammates, it starts to break down. So Microsoft created a system called Trueskill that a number of other games have since emulated. The idea of Trueskill is that it's supposed to aggregate  the approximate skill of the team as a whole and then distribute points to players based on individual skill rating. The issue here is that it treats the problem of why we can't just use an Elo system for team-based multiplayer games as though it were simply one of point distribution, and that's just not the problem with our current ladder system and team-based multiplayer games. The problem with ladders is that they feel...awful, from the highest ranked players to the bronzest of the bronze tier, everyone complains about ladders, and with good reason. They are an endless treadmill with very little reward and a lot of built-in frustration. So let's talk about that. Every game is an opportunity for disappointment, but not every game is an opportunity for an equal feeling of reward. If you're playing to the best of your ability, but your team just isn't working together, it can feel incredibly frustrating and disappointing, and while the person who blames their team for a loss is usually wrong, for the sake of designing a ladder system, it doesn't matter, because right or wrong, when players feel their team has let them down, they still feel frustrated and unhappy, and anything that leaves players feeling miserable is just bad design, and the way we design ladders just compounds this feeling by adding stakes to the game. Watching those hard-earned numbers go down feels awful, especially when you don't think it's your fault, but when you win, meh, you watch a number increase by a few points. Sure, sometimes you have a glorious game where you carry hard and have an amazing tale to tell your friends about, but that has nothing to do with the ladder itself. The ladder system didn't help create those moments, enforce those moments ,or reward those moments in any way, so the only times when a ladder win feels incredibly rewarding is when you get to a new tier on the ladder, and that's so infrequent in most games, it's almost shocking. There is basically no other area in game design where we'd let players literally go months without a real reward, and yet for many players, it takes months of their lives to go from bronze to silver or silver to gold, and somehow we're still okay with this. How do we solve that? More micro rewards and rewards that stay with you even if you lose your rank. They don't have to be great, just small prizes every time you go up 50 points, a few in-game coins, a skin, or a card back, and for people who qualify at a high rank, when they finish their last placement match, just shower them with all the tiny gifts they would have earned along the way. This will encourage people to play ladder, and the cost of doing this for a company making team-based multiplayer games is far, far less than the cost of people cycling out of competitive or actually quitting the game because they find the ladder so frustrating. Also giving players a small amount of currency or a loot box to open every couple of wins, regardless of whether those wins are in a row or separated by a pile of tiny losses is probably a good idea. It encourages players, and it reminds them that they do actually win from time to time. That's something that can be really hard to remember when you're on a losing streak. Next, we have the point system itself. It encourages a sort of gambler's conceit. Every game is sort of a wager of points. When you're losing, you want to keep playing just to get back those points you've lost, and when you're winning, you also want to keep playing because you're on a streak. This encourages people to play well past the point that they're playing at their best. In a team setting, this is the complete opposite of what we want because one frustrated or tired player negatively impacts the experience of everyone else on their team. This system is why today's ladders feel like a horrible treadmill. It's hard to 100% fix this problem, but at the very least, you can pop up playtime notifications for players or periodically tell them their win rate over the last hour in the hopes that people will realize when they're too tired to keep playing competitive. Lastly, and perhaps most importantly, team-based games are about teamwork. Scott, que the sign. That's how a team works. No matter your individual skill, a coordinated and cooperating team almost always beats a disjointed or bickering one, but very few games actually teach or encourage teamwork in any way. As awful as it sounds, things like a team play tutorial before you can actually participate in a ranked game might go a long way to help alleviate the grind. Also, anything you can do to lower toxicity creates a more team-oriented environment and a space where people actually want to get on the mic and talk to each other. We're out of time this week, but this is just the tip of the ladder iceberg. If a lot of you are interested, we might talk about it again. But we had to at least touch on it now because there's something underlying this whole thing that's a lot more important than just making our ladders better, it's the fact that if we make our ladder systems less unpleasant, a lot less people are going to get angry or frustrated playing our games, and less angry and frustrated people means less toxicity and a better experience for everyone, and that's what every game designer wants.

31,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,S8ma4QM2tyE,"The only light is the glow of the monitor. The only sound is the game's gentle music. It is 3:00 AM, you've got class in the morning and you should stop. But you're so close to getting that next level. [Extra Credits theme, ""Penguin Cap"" by CarboHydroM, remix of ""Bob-Omb Battlefield"" from ""Super Mario 64"" plays] We've all had that moment where we should stop playing but then we tell ourselves... ""Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh..."" ""I'll just keep going until I hit that next level."" ""I'm almost there."" Why do we that? Is there any advantage to doing it right then  at that moment? Rather than just getting that level the next day? Would you really lose anything by taking care of more important priorities now, and just getting that next loot box tomorrow instead? No, you wouldn't. It's a trap. I don't know if this scenario has a proper term in psychology, but James and his designer friends usually call it: ""The Arbitrary Endpoint Trap."" Arbitrary endpoints are things which seem like something you should wrap up before ending the session, even though when you finish these things doesn't really impact anything. It's kinda like when you're about to set down your book for the night, but then you notice that you're ten pages from the end. so you decide... ""AHHECK,"" ""I'll finish it tonight!"" Just for the sake of finishing it. And sometimes, this can actually have a negative impact on the experience. Keeping with the book example, you have invested 12 hours of reading to reach the end of this story. And you probably would've gotten more out of the conclusion if you had read it when you weren't half asleep and exhausted. Or, as another example... James knows a person who always... ALWAYS finishes all of the food on their plate, even if, by their own admission, it makes the experience of dining less pleasant. And in games, this is often one of the things that keeps us playing LONG after the game stopped being ""fun"". I mean, have you ever had an amazing session of Overwatch and it has just been... A BLAST But then you realize you're starting to feel a little bit sluggish, and you can't really focus on it 'cause you've just played so many rounds. You're about to quit; you're feeling pretty satisfied with that session. But then you notice you're only a game or two away from your next level. So, you slog your way through two more matches, just to get that level, and then you quit. But you don't really feel better for having done it. In fact, now you even feel less happy about your play session overall. Why is that? It's because you were no longer playing for the fun of the game. You were playing to finish a task. Worse still, that task was totally arbitrary; it was of your own making. No real benefit was gained by completing it right away. Why do we do this to ourselves? Well, because humans are hardwired to finish tasks. If we see a clear goal, and if we've already put some time in, if our sunk cost is already high, and achieving the goal's not too far away, we will usually just muscle through it, often without reflecting on why. Weirder still, if nobody gives us a goal for an activity, we will often just make one up. That is how we work. Now, I should point out that, in games, as with most things in life, not all endpoints are arbitrary. If you push yourself to just get to the next checkpoint so that the game saves and you don't lose your progress, that one's not arbitrary. It might still not be the smartest idea, and it really shouldn't be happening in modern games anyway, but in that scenario, there is a legitimate reason for handling that task before stopping. When I talk about arbitrary endpoints, I'm really talking about the endpoints which the player invents for themselves: the ones that don't actually serve as an endpoint, or need to be reached before quitting. They only exist in that annoying little part of your brain that says, [High pitched voice]  ""No, you can't stop yet, you're not done."" But the real trouble comes in when that pesky part of your brain is used against you, by less than scrupulous game designers. Now, I'm not talking about levelling systems, or even most achievements. Yes, those are extrinsic goals, and yes, they are there to get you to play longer. Yeah, they're often just Skinner Box traps. But at least they CAN serve some in-game function. Maybe they're creating a progression curve, or encouraging you to play in interesting ways. But even when those features are only there to manipulate you into extending your playtime, they are designed to do so in the long-term. They want to keep you coming back to play week-to-week. They're NOT designed specifically to keep you up at night. But if you look at a lot of Free to Play games, especially in the mobile space, they lean HEAVILY on Arbitrary Endpoint Traps. You see, many mobile companies have come to realize how important it is to keep a player's attention for a certain number of minutes the first time they sit down. The exact minute-count is different from game to game, but, especially for large games where they have TONS of data on player behavior, They will have that statistic down to a SCIENCE. After all, there a MILLION free games out there, but if they can manage to keep a player's attention long enough for them to figure out what makes the game fun, [half-whispering] or, more cynically, if they can keep your attention long enough for Sunk Cost Fallacy to start to sink in, odds are pretty good that that player is gonna keep playing, and the dev won't lose them to one of their competitors. So if you fire up a new Free to Play game, and the game keeps reminding you of how near you are to getting that next achievement, and ESPECIALLY if they have several progress bars counting up at once, so that you're constantly like 75% of the way to finishing...SOMETHING, THAT is what they are trying to do. They are trying to feed your brain arbitrary reasons to keep playing just a little bit longer. It's not just that the game is promising you rewards for progress. After all, if that was all your brain wanted, you could just put the game down whenever and finish getting those rewards next time. No no, it's REALLY that those designers are trying to serve up a constant stream of new, arbitrary endpoints for your brain to latch on to. Now, hopefully, KNOWING this will help you to avoid such traps. Even more, I hope that knowing this will make it easier to notice when you're building those traps for yourself, just so that your gaming time can be more enjoyable. Quit while you're still engaged. If the only reason you're still playing is just to finish your game chores, [outro music starts] That's a PRETTY good sign that's it's time to call it a night. See ya next week!

32,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,UBzBJPBcJ8E,"It would be immensely helpful if we could measure the impact of games in the classroom to assess their effectiveness as teaching tools. Fortunately, somebody went and did that already. ♪ [Extra Credits theme] ♪ Over the course of his work with Games For Good, James has often spoken with the folks at Filament Games, a company that not only creates educational games, but actually works on the much harder task of making games that are classroom ready. Now, here on Extra Credits, we often talk about what good  games could do in the classroom, but they're actually making games that live up to the almost impossible standard of fitting the curriculum currently mandated for schools, so that a teacher could use them  in the classroom right now, today, without worrying that it might  not meet all the required standards. Last time James talked to them, he spoke about how important getting real, concrete data on the efficacy of games in the classroom was to his work, and, to his surprise, they told him that they had  recently finished just such a study. So it is with their help and thanks to their hard work, that we are able to talk about it on the show today - to spread the word and, hopefully, to encourage others to pursue similar studies. In a previous episode about games' literacy in the classroom, we discussed the barriers that exist to widespread classroom adoption of games, focusing on the importance of promoting literacy and game mechanics and terminology to educators. Today, I want to focus on what happens  when we move past those barriers, and explain why games are so important  for education in the process. The first and most obvious answer to the question of: ""Why games for education?"" is that the current educational environment  practically begs for games content. Trends like the mandate for 21st century skills, one-to-one programs, the maker movement, project-based learning, and personalized learning are all concepts that are complex enough  to deserve their own episodes, but, in short, each of these trends is  oriented towards preparing students for a working world that demands teamwork, an understanding of technology, and self motivation. And there's tons of research to show that learning games work, but games are only a part of the equation. Teachers are the other core piece. There was a great article on this in the Journal of Educational Psychology, but, short version: When we think about games in the classroom, we *have* to think about teachers, because teachers are designing  the experiences their students have every day. It's up to the teacher to create or  select instructional tools and decide how best to incorporate them into their lessons. These decisions are as important, maybe more important, than the qualities of the particular tools involved. Using games can improve learning under a variety of circumstances, but the greatest games have been achieved by teachers who surround students game experiences with additional support and instruction. So, for the folks at Filament, curricula was the first and most obvious feature to wrap around the games, making it easier for the teacher to bring games into the classroom by providing teachers with an obvious place to insert games into their current curriculum. Then, to couple that with the other advantage games have for teachers, their next priority feature was metrics. They created a way for teachers to get a more in depth look into how each student was learning. After all, normally a teacher only gets to see the end result of the student's homework. But games can record everything along the way, providing a lot more information about how and where a student may struggle. Then, with all of this in place, they reached out to Sun Prairie School District in Wisconsin, which deployed the Filament Learning Games library across their entire district. They worked with Mary Headington, a fantastic teacher who was eager to help them study how one game from the Filament Learning Library made a difference in her classroom. Because, truth is, even though we all believe - and I would even say know - that games have incredible potential as learning tools - I mean, James has seen it, Filament has seen it - without hard data about they can be applied *right now* in classrooms, it's really hard to get major institutions to adopt them. Besides, without this data, as much as we know that games can help, we don't know exactly how to refine our games, where our assumptions may be wrong, or exactly how we can better integrate games into the classroom. So getting that data is what Filament set out to do, which brings us back to the study with Mary Headington. The game she used is called Planet Mechanic - a sandbox light simulation of the Sun, Earth, Moon system, in which students can manipulate planetary bodies to see the impact those manipulations have on the ground level planetary conditions. Students can adjust features like atmosphere, tilt, rotation and lunar cycles to change temperature, atmospheric pressure, and time on the planet. These are concepts that are pretty challenging to grasp without a tangible representation, and the game makes them more digestible and accessible to students. For her study, Mary had all of her students take a pre-assessment to test their current knowledge of the content in the game. She then split her students into three sections: a section where students would only play the game, a section where students would only receive traditional instruction from her, and a section where students would play both the game and supplement that gameplay with traditional instruction. Each section used the same amount of class time, and the sections that received direct instruction from Mary were tasked with a variety of supplemental activities. Students viewed interactive visualizations, drew diagrams, and used hands-on models of the Earth and Sun to reinforce their learning. And afterwards, all three sections took another post-assessment. The results might surprise you. The scores of students who only played the game were almost flat. The average grades for this group went up by .1%. Students who only received traditional instruction fared considerably better, scores went up by an average of 6%, showing strong growth between the pre- and post-test, thanks to Mary's skilled guidance. But the students who played the game *and* received traditional instruction? For those students, the average scores went up by a whopping ten percent - a full letter grade. So what does this indicate about  the place of games in the classroom? These results verify that the teacher's role in guiding the classroom is as crucial as ever, with the games acting as a force multiplier for her instruction. This is how we need to view games for learning: a pedagogical force multiplier. I guess I should explain that. A force multiplier refers to some factor that increases or multiplies effectiveness. In the context of the classroom, a learning game takes the content we deliver to students and amplifies their engagement, investment, and retention. The results of the study are clear: without the educator's critical role in the classroom, the game as a stand alone tool doesn't suffice. But, with an educator's guidance,  the game helps the educator to exceed the results that they would get in the absence of that game. And Mary had her own thoughts to share on what games accomplished for her students. She said, ""Games are never going to replace the teacher. But games *are* changing how the teacher teaches. Traditional instruction focuses on providing students with the information we want them to know and then delivering it in a controlled manner. But in this study, we witnessed students struggling with the concept and then determine what they needed to know. They then used this information to direct their own personalized learning."" This looks different for each student. Some students chose to conference with the teacher. Some looked to classroom resources and Internet links, while others went out on their own in search of the information. These skills teach students *how* to learn, as opposed to being told *what* to learn. If we provide situations for students to continually practice these skills, especially in a game environment, we will find that their motivation and thirst for knowledge increases. Teachers are finding that education is becoming more of a partnership with the student. and games foster that dynamic. As we move more and more rapidly toward a future that suffuses technology into every aspect of our lives, the idea that video games can serve as a foundational tool for instruction will become increasingly mainstream. Filament is trying to do their part to lay the groundwork for an era of classroom content that includes video games by default, but they need help from the communities that serve as stakeholders for school districts. If you want to see your local school district adopt a game based learning program, get involved and advocate for more forward facing programs in your community. Schools really need that community support to justify the hardware and software purchases that equip their students for the future. If they're past the hardware adoption point, and are ready to look at content, point them to the Filament Games District Implementation Guide. We've put a link down below. It's a free resource that helps administrators wrap their heads around adding game based learning to their curricula offerings. It's a pretty easy argument to make. [Outro music starts playing] Our success as a country depends on a well functioning and effective educational system. It's on us to fill that system with forward facing programs like game based learning that help to maximize our students' acheivement and to pave their way to success in the modern world. Thank you for watching, and we'll see you next week. ♪ [Outro music] ♪ "
33,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,UCj8llyzfWo," There you are, playing the PvP in your World War II shooter, and all of the sudden, you're a Nazi. You didn't ask for this. You didn't choose this. Yet, there it is, and it's treated no differently than playing a British soldier. This is bad on so many levels. No one should ever have a random chance of fighting for the Nazis, and we should never express that there's no meaningful difference between Nazis and Allied soldiers, or that they're functionally interchangeable. And before anyone equivocates and says not all ""German soldiers in WWII were Nazis,"" if they were wearing the swastika, and are functioning as an arm of the Nazi government, then unless the game goes out of its way to tell you specifically, that your particular character is not a Nazi? Then they're a Nazi. In that multiplayer shooter, when it switched you to the German side, did it go out of its way to tell you that the person you're playing was pressed into service under threat of their life? Yeah, that's a big old ""Nope."" Oh, and on a similar note, let's please stop forcing people to play as terrorists, as well. There you are, playing your modern shooter, and all of a sudden you're a terrorist. You didn't ask for this. You didn't choose this. And yet, second verse same as the first, there it is. I mean that's literally the name of your side in the game. We can do better than this. Even if you put aside all of the people who have had traumatic experiences with these groups, who have lost loved ones to terrorists, or who have had generations of their families wiped out by Nazis, no one should have to put on the costume of an ideology they find abhorrent, without actually opting into it in your game. And by making people do so, we get them to stop thinking about it, to stop thinking of the meaning behind these things. We normalize them. We make them just window dressing for entertainment. Those uniforms, those symbols, become things that no longer inherently revolt us. They reduce our visceral reaction to seeing the embodiment of these ideologies. Now, does this make us totally ignore the history that comes with them? No, but for some people it moves them from the territory of ""revolting"" to just ""edgy."" It makes scrawling a swastika on something, changed from ""unthinkable"" to just ""dangerous."" It means you might not take iron crosses all over a website as a warning sign that you should immediately leave. And if you don't leave, you might start reading and buying into hateful ideas there. It seems like such a small and simple thing, but it's things like this that erode our safeguards against dangers we've sacrificed so much to fight. By the time you've played a hundred hours of being a Nazi, their voice stabs become memes and in-jokes with your friends. By the thousandth time you've respawned as a terrorist, you're either celebrating them or making fun of them, neither of which helps the global crisis we have that takes thousands of lives every year. So what do we do? That's easy. Don't make them morally equivalent. Don't make there be no in-game moral difference between your Nazis and your Allies, between your terrorists and your counter-terrorist squads. Frame PvP as a training exercise, or simply take one of your non-odious sides and recolor them so that it's red vs blue, rather than Axis versus Allies. A good example of a game that does this is RainbowSix Siege. All of your bomb defusion, and hostage rescue multiplayer, with no normalizing terrorists. In fact, by having all of the characters as counter-terrorists, training for a possible threat, it highlights how real and present of a threat that is. And if you decide that you need to have both sides be playable, don't make them interchangeable. Don't have players randomly spawn in as one or the other. Allow players to choose which side they're on. Now, of course, this has all sorts of in-game problems, such as creating shorter wait times for fascists, but you know what? Those wait times could be artificially extended, if it meant players had an active choice in what teams they would represent, if you're saying we need people playing Nazis in our games. And if you're going to say, ""but we need it for historical reasons,"" then your game better actually be historical. You can't really just hide behind the fact you called your desert map El-Alamein and say ""but its historical!"" If that were the case, you need your PvP to at least represent real historical events, and be a realistic take on those battles. Once you make both sides balanced, it's also no longer historical, and you can't really say that you need Nazis anymore for historical accuracy. Oh, and once you let players get cool weapons that weren't actually at that particular battleground? It's also no longer historically accurate, and you can't declare that your game will suffer if you don't put players in the jackboots of the Third Reich. And once your map is something carefully designed to have good gameplay, by a team in a room in San Francisco or LA, and it's not a faithful reconstruction of the actual places the historical events occurred in, you can no longer say, ""We need to have players take up arms in service of terror or hate."" And look, we're not saying we can't have games about WWII or about terrorism. We're not even saying we shouldn't make games where you play as a Nazi or a terrorist, but what we are saying, is that the fact that you're playing as a Nazi or a terrorist in a game has to mean something, and it can't just be a skin. It can't be something that a game randomly drops you into. And really, if we are saying anything in this episode, it's this: games can do better. And in this particular case, it's not even that hard to do better, and it's no more costly to do better! All it requires is that we in the game industry be cognizant of the world around us, and what these symbols were drawing on mean. That we think as we're building, not just about the game we're working on, but about the world as a whole. If we can do that, we can take a big step forward for the industry. We can stop helping to normalize Nazis. "
34,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,UDtlizfYPUM,"Last time, we discussed many of the dangers that real-world games have to design around in order to be safe and enjoyable for everyone. This time, let's have the much more fun discussion about all of the amazing things bringing games into the real world can do, if we design for it. *intro music* First off, we can get people to notice the world around them. This may seem like an odd thing, given how many complaints there have been about Pokémon GO players being oblivious to their surroundings, but these sort of games can highlight what a magical place we live in. It's so easy to be too caught up in our daily lives to notice some of the amazing things about the places we live. Just the other day, James was playing Pokémon GO and it drew his attention to a mural that he'd never noticed in his own neighborhood. It showed him something new about his town and helped him to appreciate the place more. But we can integrate this into design even further: If we were to simply divide up the globe into reasonable sized chunks, say, half a square mile [1,3 m²] or so, and give players a small bonus if they visit every location in an area, it would encourage people to see everything around them and help make sure that they got to see some of the more obscure sites and hidden gems. More that that, if you can work things, like links to Wikipedia or even small sourced blurbs about some of the more famous locations in your game, you can give people the opportunity to self-educate. With a little bit of effort, every walk can become a small walking tour. Or what about historical locations? Like not just the places where a historical site or a landmark still exists today, what about the places, where some historical event once happened or where some significant thing once existed? If, as a company, you're willing to put in the time to include those, it could give the player a window into another world. One, where the very ground they tread on takes completely new significance. Of course, it would be difficult to have these specific locations affect gameplay in any way, because locations are user-submitted and the developer often just won't know that much about them but for a large enough game, having special rewards or events that at least fit the theme of some of the most well-known sites around the globe seems like a way to enhance the game experience while getting more people excited about our shared heritage. These games also, by their very nature, get us excited about going outside again. I had mentioned making the player notice the magic in the real world, but these games also make the real world magical. Things you never look forward to doing like walking the dog or running errands become joyful activities. There is value in that, which shouldn't be dismissed. And then there is the fitness side of things: Pokémon GO actually does a decent job of getting people out and walking but there is even more potential there. I'm certainly not a fitness expert, so I'll try not to speculate too much here, but a game company could easily work with people who are fitness experts, in order to encourage players to walk an optimal amount per day or even to encourage running in a way that's thematic, fun and, at the same time, very healthy. I mean, imaging having to run a half mile [0,8 km] in seven minutes in order to get away from a dragon. Or to catch some elusive, agile monster. And if technology akin to the Fitbit ever becomes a standard feature of your phone there's a whole host of things we can do to get people to enjoy excercising enough to lead fitter, happier lives. There are also economic benefits to getting people out more: My local coffee shop has a PokéStop right next to it. They basically leave an active PokéLure on it 100% of the time. And every day, I see people just sitting there hanging out, ordering coffee, doing work and catching Pokémon all the while. Forbes did a whole article on how to use Pokémon GO to help your small business. And I love this. Niantic gets to make money on all these businesses buying lures and small shops get to make their locations more appealing to customers which is way more cost-efficient than say, repainting or installing fancy lights. But there is also potential for partnerships with large cooperations, which is a bit of a danger. I worry about the day when people-placement becomes a thing and cooperations like Walmart or Starbucks can pay to have unique Pokémon appear in the middle of their locations. These sort of partnership deals threaten the magical nature of the game reduce the player to a commodity and encourage game companies toward predatory practices. It's a dangerous can of worms to open, but realistically there's just no way to avoid it, if games like these get big enough. Depending on the game though, there might be ways to inoculate the audience against this with some subversive design. At least a little. As a side note: If you ever wanted to walk a dangerous line you could use the phone camera's inherent ability to scan barcodes and use barcodes as a random number seed to generate items in-game. On the one hand, the designer in James just salivates at all the cool things you could to with that, but on the other hand, it's just rife for abuse and someone's gonna do it sooner or later... But Pokémon GO has shown, that these real-world games have a thousand other positive effects, that I couldn't have even predicted: Animal shelters are organizing days for people to take the animals on Poké-walks, The national parks in the US have seen a massive uptick in visitors, and even in those cases, where some unfortunate person finds a dead body or something because they were out looking for Pokémon for one: It's good somebody found that body and two: Sooner or later some Pokémon explorer is gonna find a person who's not dead, who's injured or lost in some remote area. And a life is gonna end up being saved because Pokémon or some game like it has encouraged people to go outside. But I think the greatest possibility and the greatest danger lies in truly opening up the platform. Imagine if you could design adventures or dungeons for your local park. Or create a module for your neighborhood that anybody could run through. It would require a game with far more mechanics than Pokémon GO to work, but I think that day will come. And the idea that turning the places we love into magical adventures for our loved ones or into romps through history for our students is an enticing thought. It's something that I hope to see come to pass. Unfortunately, there is a design hurdle, that I can't work my way around: The possibility for a poorly designed level or a troll designer causing people to get hurt. My hope is that somebody is gonna find a solution though. Possibly one of you! Because I would love to be playing that game in five or ten years time. Anyway, I hope that you've enjoyed this look at the potential in real-world design. See you next week! "
35,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,VAXj30kNwfo,"Welcome back to games you might not have tried everybody ♪ It's been a long time since we featured a bunch of console games on here So let's do that today, like always all of these games are interesting They're not necessarily all good But they do all show off some intriguing facet of design or tell a story in a new and novel way they've all got something we can learn from but Sometimes that means that we recommend them here with the hope that some other team will learn from them and then deliver on that Potential in a more polished or effective way also since we're talking about console releases here these games aren't necessarily obscure They're just the kind of game that might have passed you by amidst the tidal wave of hits we've been seeing lately So caveats aside let's get to it Let it die This is a new James favorite right here It's grasshopper studios at their best it has that wonderful punk-rock In-Your-Face feeling that most studios shy away from to play it safe. It's over-the-top Ultraviolence supports the feel of the world and the setting rather than simply being there to pander to Player's bloodlust It's got an intriguing story and the world that you'll want to know more about Its combat may not be on a dark souls level, but it'll still have you white knuckling your controller most of all though, it's got Microtransactions done right the game is a roguelike in which you try to ascend this tower full of enemies and it's entirely free to play but Being a rogue-like you have to survive long enough to make it back to an elevator Or you will lose all of your progress which can be just as harrowing as making it back to a dark souls bonfire But if you do die the game gives you the option to pay Roughly the equivalent of 25 Cents to get back up and keep going just like an arcade They give you a few credits for free every week and back when James was playing a ton of it he found himself paying maybe 75 cents a week for continues. Usually due to stupid mistakes or overconfidence now I'm a hundred percent willing to pay 75 cents a week for something that gives me hours of entertainment and return. I wish more games would approach free-to-play like this Oh and somewhere buried in the Playstation store menus There's a one-time for a five-dollar starter pack that gives you several months worth of starting credit So you know if you like the game? That's probably worth getting Yakuza 0 If the two times we already name-dropped this game weren't recommendation enough. Here is the official games you might not have tried endorsement We've wanted to recommend the yakuza game forever, but none of the games were ever quite there. This time though I feel like they nailed it Yakuza 0 presents an interesting take on open-world design instead of giving a huge open space with vast swaths of empty landscape They have a very compact open-world with something interesting to find every few feet. More than that the story is awesome the side stories are some of the most endearing you'll find in modern gaming, there is so much style to everything and their representation of 80s Japan is phenomenal there are also so many many games that I don't even know how to describe them if you want to play shogi or mahjong there are full and complete versions of each of those games in there you want to do some batting practice? Bowling? Race slot cars? Sing some karaoke? Those are all in there And I am only scratching the surface Heck there are fully emulated sega games packed into this, not to mention a real estate minigame and running a nightclub minigame that each have their own storylines And you could easily pour hours into each of those if you wanted. So if you're looking for a fun tough guy with a heart of gold story that is dripping with style. You can do a lot worse than Yakuzo 0 Oh, and it's a prequel, so it's the perfect place to jump into the series Everything What do you want to be name anything? Literally anything Okay, this game is batty You can literally be anything. You want to roll around as a goat? Gotcha covered; plop down a level and you can waddle around as a beetle or as a patch of grass Pop down one more time now your must drop down one more and now you're playing a bacteria or maybe go the other way go bigger become a continent or a planet or a Galaxy there are literally hundreds of things to discover and become all accompanied by the pseudo mystic lectures of Alan Watts One of the first things which everybody should understand Is that every creature in the universe that is in any way sensitive and in any manner of speaking conscious Regards itself as a human being. Of course as you've probably noticed to include basically everything that's in this game They had to cut some corners on the animation. It's art in the gameplay, but come on. It's everything It's not only that every little organism which exists depends on its total environment The reverse is also true that the total environment depends on each and every one of those little organisms so that you could say this universe consists of an arrangement of pattern in which every event is essential to the whole thing. NieR: Automata I guess games that let you do a lot of things has sort of been a theme today and NieR: Automata is no exception Sometimes this game is an open-world action RPG sometimes it's a single stick shooter sometimes it's a twin stick shooter Sometimes it is a pig riding simulator, but most of all it is a tragedy. It may not seem that way at first But it's got more Heartbreaking moments than the rest of the triple a scene delivers in a year and these moments aren't the sort of forced Tearjerkers that you see in so many RPGs where a character you love Sacrifices themselves for the greater cause. These are smaller tragedies tragedies that feels much more real Tragedies that really stick with you. Did you play NieR? Okay then you know what I'm talking about. And if you haven't played NieR, go play NieR too. Sexy Brutale If eight hours of murder and mayhem sound A-okay to you? Then let's talk the Sexy Brutale. Now this isn't the type of mayhem, and murder you might be expecting though This is really the Groundhogs Day of murder It's sort of an adventure, puzzle, stealth game where you're trying to stop a wacky series of murders in a mansion where you can hop back in time and while some of the ways hopping back in time work can be a little irksome (like having to re-pick up all the things you just picked up). It's actually the generous approach to stealth that intrigued me with this one. The rewind mechanics take away some of that arbitrary punishment feeling that a lot of stealth games can give especially if you're the impatient type. Now this game is not without flaws but if you're looking for an adventure with a solid Morbid writing that revels in its Poe and it's Edward Gorey, you better check out Sexy Brutale And finally Resident Evil 7 Granted I know it's a little weird to put a game that sold umpteen million copies on this list But this is about games you might not have tried, and I know that. I almost didn't try this one. What can I say, I had gotten a little tired of the action shooter series that Resident Evil had become. But if you have the same reticence that I did don't fear or do fear because this is the first Resident Evil game in a long time that returns to its horror roots. Moreover it does so in an interesting way. I was amazed that to see a Japanese studio totally nailed what I call appalachian horror. This weird American sphere of primitive, almost atavistic families isolated in the vast backcountry of the United States and in an interesting twist that I hope doesn't spoil too much they managed to slide in just the slightest bit of commentary by having this family We're supposed to be afraid of not actually be degenerate or evil until they come into contact with a certain unambiguously evil megacorp Resident Evil is good again y'all. Make some time for it And with that I will leave you hopefully something here will help you get through those summer doldrums. See you next week "

AAA games should not cost $60 anymore. And I'm going to spend the rest of this video explaining why. The price for a AAA game was set at $60 right around the launch of HD consoles: The Xbox 360 and the PS3. That was around 2005 and the price hasn't shifted again since. But the value of the U.S. Dollar certainly has. The rate of inflation over the last decade has averaged out to roughly 2% per year. According to the best figures I can find, that means that the value of goods has inflated 25.34% since we started selling games for $60. And let's just round that down to a flat 25% to keep the math simple. So due to inflation alone, AAA games should be selling for $75 right now. But obviously, inflation isn't the only factor in play here. AAA games are all competing to have the best looking game on the market. And that graphical arms race gets way more expensive with each new console generation. And, sure, we have found a lot of clever efficiencies along the way to reduce costs. I mean, heck, we treat third-party game engines like middleware now, and that saves tons. But even with those savings, I would estimate that AAA games cost somewhere between three and four times as much to make as they did back in 2005. So... does that mean games should actually be costing somewhere between $225 and $300? Fortunately, no. Things aren't quite that dire. It's pretty hard to pin down exact numbers on this, but the game playing audience is a lot bigger than it was in 2005, too. Like, several times bigger. And that means that there's a lot more customers to sell to, which helps to make up for that higher production cost. And can result In even bigger profits, IF you manage to make a huge hit. Unfortunately, when you're counting on that higher number of sales to make a profit, if your game flops... Well, you're gonna be losing an impossibly large, possibly studio-sinking amount of money. But, since we're just focusing on what the average retail price of a game should be, let's just ignore that increased risk factor for now. Based on what we've seen firsthand working in this industry... (much of which is under NDA, unfortunately) ...if I had to make a gut estimate - and understand this really is just a rough guess... I would say that the actual retail price of a modern AAA game, without any additional ongoing revenue sources to support it... ...should probably be as high as $85 to $90 new. Now, understandably, that number freaks the industry out. Who outside of Australia is gonna pay $90 for a video game? I mean, we all saw what happened to the Neo Geo. And this fear has been compounded by the success of the mobile game market... ...which has sort of trained consumers to think that games should be astonishingly cheap. I mean, for a tablet game, $10 is considered expensive. Even if that same game would cost $30 on the DS or $40 on Steam. For that matter, Steam Sales have been training us to expect cheaper games, too. And so the industry has kept that $60 price right where it is. And, I mean, maybe they're right to do so. A lot of people got pretty bent out of shape when the price got bumped up to $60 back in 2005. And there is something about the number 70 that just feels like... [breathes in sharply] Yikes, that's a lot of money. Industry wisdom really may be right here. Maybe raising that standard price any higher than $60 WOULD lead to a drop in sales. But! By not raising prices, we've sort of put ourselves in a tough spot. If we are gonna cover our development costs, reduce the risk of catastrophic losses... ...and show our shareholders the return percentages they're expecting, we've gotta do something to increase revenue. And we've tried to do that in a lot of different ways, to varying degrees of success. First, we tried increasing revenue by selling DLC. But fans got upset if we sold that DLC at launch, and they didn't buy it if we released the DLC later. Next, we tried designing games to be perpetual experiences. Games that you would play all year long, Because then, we could sell map packs and expansions over that game's longer lifespan. But supporting those games long-term turned out to be pretty expensive too, and it didn't really work for every kind of game. Besides, players can only actively keep up with so many perpetual games at once. So, all of those perpetual games have to compete for attention and the audience just gets locked down. It's like the MMORPG flood all over again. And so, now we are trying the next thing: loot boxes. We'll come back to the specific topic of loot boxes in a couple of weeks, but this is basically where we're at. And now, we as an audience have to decide what we want. Are we okay with paying more for these games at retail? $70? $80? Maybe even more? The data suggests that the answer is no, but if that's the case... Well, we're gonna have to learn to live with loot boxes or microtransactions or whatever other model the industry attempts next. And by learn to live with, I don't mean put up with predatory crap. I mean, we're gonna have to find a way to reward developers for making good supplementary income systems... ...that aren't overly aggressive or in any way required to play competitively. Monetization systems that leave you satisfied and actually increase your enjoyment of the game you're spending dozens of hours on... Even if you choose to spend very little. But make no mistake: those really are our only two options right now. Because, like I said at the beginning: AAA games just should not cost $60 anymore. See you next week! "

38,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,XWgc20zbRXk,"Welcome back to design club, A show in which we analyze the design of a particular game level or mechanic and this time we're diving deep. We thought it'd be fun to do something similar to what James does when he gives design workshops for developers so for the next five days we're gonna pick apart the first floor of the Durlag's tower dungeon from Baldur's gate Yep, just the first level. We're gonna go room by room and look at exactly how every piece fits together to create the player experience. Why do five entire episodes just for one dungeon floor you might ask? Well because to this day Durlag's tower stands as one of the finest examples of dungeon design in all of gaming. This media may have changed a great deal since 1999 but the design principles used here are timeless, whether you're building dungeons for a 2D game or a 3D game, a modern RPG or a retro throwback. But we can't just jump right into the first floor of the dungeon below Durlag's tower just like that. No no no no. Frst we got to talk about how you get to Durlag's tower. Because we're a dungeon is located and how you're guided to it is a big part of how we experience the dungeon itself first let's look at where Durlag's tower is located in the world of Baldur's gate. Right over here. Now this is important because Durlag's tower is part of an expansion and while most of the expansion content is way off on the other side of the map, the designers made a conscious choice to place this tower pretty solidly between your starting location and two of your first main objectives, and because of the way zones are linked in Baldur's gate you're pretty likely to stumble upon it early in the game. This is important for two reasons first because the way in which the player discovers a dungeon affect their experience of it. Now a lot of games would probably give the player a quest or an objective to guide them to the dungeon and that's a perfectly fine approach but maybe not the best one. Hand holding the player right to the front door doesn't exactly create a sense of wonder. Instead if the player can be made to stumble upon it on their own so that they have this moment of finding something unexpected and incredible in your world, or if they can be made to feel like they've discovered this mysterious place by piecing together vague hints and clues, the mere discovery of the place will be a much more powerful experience, the trick is to design in such a way that almost a hundred percent of your players will stumble across your dungeon without the hand-holding. That's why Durlag's tower is placed here. The second thing you'll note about the placement is that, since the player's likely to discover this place early on, they'll be pretty low-level when they do. Now the dungeon itself is actually one of the most challenging locations in the entire game and at first blush it might seem like it would make a bit more sense to put the tower maybe over here near the other late game content. But as an experience that would feel a little gamey. The world feels a bit more holistic if there are difficult areas scattered all around the world, rather than all clumped in one location. Additionally placing Durlag's tower near early-game locations makes the tower aspirational. You discover it and it seems pretty cool, and you try going in and you probably get totally wrecked and you think to yourself: Hmm, I bet that there's some cool stuff in there, I can't wait to come back and thrash this place later. And when you do come back 5 levels stronger it feels just great taking down enemies that were terrifying threats a few levels ago. Imagine if you hadn't discovered this place until later in the game when you are already strong enough to tackle it. These guys would just feel like normal enemies then. Now of course the reason that most games don't do this is because having the player died to something they had no idea they weren't ready for often feels unfair, like the game is cheating. This begs the question why doesn't it feel unfair when Durlag's tower does it. Well to answer that let's jump to the map entrance. Immediately upon entering the zone you meet this guy right here, and pretty much all of his dialogue tells you that this place is bad news. Notice how this guy also happens to serve as a merchant. There's a reason for that. For any lengthy dungeon, especially if your game limits the amount of stuff the player can carry, it's essential to find a way to give the player easy access to a shop keep. This will radically reduce the amount of time spent fiddling with the inventory, and radically increase the time spent actually playing the dungeon. And actually playing the dungeon is what everybody wants, player and designer alike. Next we have what I call an anticipation space. The player has just been warned by that friendly merchant don't go this way or you'll die, but then nothing... This builds the tension and then BAM! The bouncers of Durlag's tower show up. You know those you must be this tall to ride signs? These guys are that. In fact these two enemies are far more difficult than what your initially going to encounter in the tower itself. Now this is the opposite of how we usually build the game's difficulty curve, but it's actually a perfect choice in this specific case. Because if you're gonna put a challenging area in a low level section of your game, it's super important that you prevent the player from spending hours frustratedly trying to beat a challenge that's simply impossible for them. These two incredibly difficult enemies act as gatekeepers by putting them out front, the designers know that if the player gets past these guys, whatever level the player might be, they're ready. They are skilled enough to enjoy the rest of the dungeon. After these gatekeepers we have a long, narrow, seemingly empty path with nothing at all. At first this might seem like wasted space, but it too has a purpose. See the designers know that some clever players are going to try to attempt to just run past those gatekeeper monsters instead of fighting them. And that would be a problem, because like i said earlier it's super important that the designers know with absolute certainty that the player can actually defeat the gatekeepers before they take on the tower. So this space is designed to trap the player and make sure that even with Baldur's Gate plunky pathfinding, the enemies have ample time to kill most of the player's party if they try to just run past. Now note that there actually is one trivial enemy along this pat, right here. This enemy is not meant to be a challenge. He's here simply to run interference, to slow down any underleveled players who might be trying to run past the gatekeepers. Also note the enemy type it's a doppelganger. Even with this throwaway enemy, the designers didn't miss an opportunity to do a little foreshadowing. The entire design of the outside of the tower functions as one big gate. If you can get past all this, you're ready. Now i should note that there is one minor quest in the game that's meant to lead you right to the tower if you're one of the players who bought the expansion after you already beat most of the game, but it's clear that the designers were anticipating that many future players would stumble on the tower in the course of normal play, so I'm just gonna move along just note. that even though they tried to make sure that 80-plus percent of their players would find Durlag's tower on their own they, did include a minor hand-holding quest well after the point in the game that players should have found the tower, just to make sure that the other twenty percent players didn't miss out. And now at last we reach the tower itself from here we can go either up or down, and if i had infinite time to make these I talk about the upper levels of Durlag's tower and how they are used to build the players curiosity about just what happened in this strange tower and why the place now lies abandoned, but there is just so much designed to dig into in the dungeons lower levels I'm just gonna dive right in. Join us next time as we get to the real meat of their legs tower and discuss how encounters are built how traps are placed and how treasure is stored. See you next time!

39,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,Z3QsCy4ekWk,"Prepare to be spoiled if you don't want Prey spoilers this is your chance to bail and go play Prey it's really good. I'm serious as soon as the music Finishes playing I'm going to drop like the biggest spoiler this game has I am buying you time right now and that window is closing This is it here. We go three two one Prey ends with what seems like the stupidest most ""videogamy"" moral choice ever it literally reads kill everybody or take your brother's hand on the surface that seems so ludicrous and so typical of badly done video game moral choice moments that it's easy to dismiss But it's actually not quite as simple as it may sound because that ridiculous choice is actually just part of a much larger ethical journey that prey has been working the player through from the opening minutes At the outset of the game, you're presented with a psychological test And it seems like a throwaway exercise a nothing moment filled with the kind of pablum pseudo psych questions that you would see shared by your more pretentious friends on Facebook or on a Voight-Kampff test But what you may not realize in that moment is that prey the game is that psychological test the whole experience is designed to mirror the test both in fiction and for the player Let's look at that test for a moment. It's questions can be summed up as One: how open are you to new experiences? Two: Say you're sentenced to death for something you've done How do you feel Three: Which is more important the good of the few or the good of the many? Four: which matters more to you your personal well-being or the well-being of others These questions are all very easy to answer in the abstract you probably already have an idea of how you would answer them But the genius of Prey is that after it has you answer those questions It is going to force you to act them out for real or at least in a simulation and in doing so Prey is going to force you not only to question the answers you gave but to reveal your true answers through your actions The in-game quiz itself is a pretty big hint to Prey's larger purpose But what's astounding? Is that prey makes this even more overt by having that simulation actually be the in-game story? After the credits roll Prey reveals that the whole game has actually been a simulation designed to test an alien creature to see if it has the right psychological makeup and that creature is you. You have literally been playing that creature the whole time which means that you as the human being playing this game are a creature taking a psychological test in the form of a simulation in which you inhabit a creature taking a psychological test in the form of a simulation So let's see how the game forces you to address each of those questions on that test Question one: how open are you to new experiences? This one's fairly straightforward. In a mechanical sense, there's usually many different ways to solve any given problem in this game Did you actually seek out alternative solutions? Or did you just use the same solutions over and over again shooting or hacking your way through everything? shooting or hacking your way through everything? Question two: Say you're sentenced to death for something you've done How do you feel? This one's a strangely specific question And it's actually the premise of how the player is supposed to understand the story for most of the game Early on you meet basically a robot version of yourself who tells you that you have to destroy the station you're on and That you are going down with the ship that you have to do this because of the things you've done It is made explicit that this is a death sentence and that you are the one who has to carry it out Why do you have to carry it out though well because past you decided to secretly conduct very dangerous experiments Experiments that might endanger mankind itself. Why did you do it? In flashbacks your character gives several justifications But they all boil down to ushering in a new era for mankind. To create a future where as a species we are something greater, something more And that brings us to question 3. Which is more important the good of the few or the good of the many? On the test this was phrased as a hackneyed psyche hypothetical: a runaway train is bearing down on five people tied to a track. You can cause the train to switch tracks But there's one person tied to the second track - so what do you do? For many people this seems like just a simple equation You switch the tracks and do the least harm. But that is the very justification that the trans star employees have used to justify all of the horrors you find on this station. All of this killing in thename of science all of this torture and inhumanity All of it was justified by saying that it was the sacrifice of a few to save millions of lives. To make all of humanity better The entire game is built to point out that the question of the good of the few versus the good of the many is a fundamentally flawed question that it can't be reduced to an abstract equation the reality of that question is so complex and when somebody tries to make that decision from a removed abstract point of view, terrible realities can ensue. To drive this home the game makes it abundantly clear Just how difficult it is to make that choice as an abstract calculation when in a real situation Throughout the whole game over and over and over you are told that if even one of these alien creatures gets to earth, mankind is doomed, billions of people would die and yet I'll bet a lot of you who played this tried to find a way to get people safely off the station before you blew it up I bet that seemed like the right thing to do saving those people but in doing so you put everybody on earth at risk. Any shuttle any escape pod leaving that station could easily house one of those shape-shifting aliens They could take the form of a seatbelt or a clipboard or a coffee cup in terms of pure calculation You can't risk that it is ridiculous to try to save a handful of people from what can be thought of as the world's most infectious disease if it means risking the whole planet below And yet without even thinking it's easy to prioritize the people standing right in front of you. These people with faces and names over the unnamed and unknown masses Which leads us to the last question. Question 4, which matters more to you Would you put the good of the many over the good of yourself? Here we come to the end of the line. The question looked so silly at first Choosing whether to take your brother's hand or kill everybody Because in the light of the rest of test and in light of everything you've experienced on the station, that question has become about whether there is inherent worth in humanity. Whether we are redeemable The philosophy that Prey explores is a very bleak one. It presents us with aliens the typhon And we are taught to think of them as the enemy as violent ruthless killers Then we're told that the typhon lack empathy they lack compassion It's not that they suppress empathy but that they simply don't have any understanding or capacity for it they may not even understand that they're killing people when they transmute us or incorporate our consciousness into the coral they weave But do you remember when you were first told this truth about the typhon? It was amidst some scenes of the most compassionless human acts amid scientific tests carried out on living human beings. It forces us to ask who is worse these aliens who kill with no capacity for empathy or human beings who have that capacity and yet ignore it to do terrible acts. There's this one moment where a man an ex cosmonaut whose only crime is disagreeing with the government is sealed in a test chamber. He pleads with the characters He tells them that he signed on for this to see his daughter that they promised that he could see his daughter Meanwhile the scientists just read over the Diagnostics for their tests Then they begin. They dropped one of the Typhon into his chamber and watch as the creature devours him It is not quick or painless you hear his screams And the only point to this test was to see if the creature would metamorphose differently using an old subject rather than a young one. It seems so arbitrary an experiment done Just because they could like a child poking an animal with a stick just to see what it'll do and that whole experiment was ordered by the character you are currently playing Your character might be the worst person on this station the one most willing to expend others lives the one most certain that the ends will justify the means And so we arrive at that last choice Do we kill humanity or embrace it? Ultimately it's asking us if we can look at our human tribe objectively and really see the darkness in us see a darkness, darker than those inky Typhon Darker than those living shadows that walk the halls of Talos one If we can, then and only then will we have the perspective to make this choice We can condemn humanity knowing that mankind often casts aside the compassion we've been endowed with to achieve our goals or we can spare humanity declaring that so long as we have the capacity for compassion within us, we have a chance at redemption Therein lies the genius of prey it begins by asking you simple ethics questions And then proceeds to make you put the lie to each answer you gave Thereby forcing you to actually examine those answers I said I like to try new things and yet I fell back on guns and hacking most of the time I said that I would feel confident in the worth of my choices Even if society condemned me for them But when push came to shove I scrambled to find a way out to find a way to escape this space station I Said that I would put the good of the many over the good of the few and yet I fought to save Talos one's occupants breaking quarantine and potentially exposing earth to the most dire of threats I said that I would choose the good of the many over my own And yet I left that station alive and in the end I chose to take my brother's hand And I'm still asking myself Did I do it because I believe in humanity? Or did I do it simply because I am human and I need to believe that there is some good in this species Otherwise what hope is there for me? Thanks for watching. We'll see you next week "

The games we have now are inherently connected and almost as a matter of course they see us playing with people from all around the globe Shouldn't it be even easier to bring us together with these? It should be, and I have heard plenty of stories about times where it has been One that always sticks in my mind came from a young woman James met at a convention, who told him that she was never very concerned about international affairs That she just wanted to go to school and play her games, and let the rest of the world sort itself out But then one day, one of her World of Warcraft guild mates stopped showing up to raids A week went by, then two And then she started asking around to see if anybody knew this person Finally, she found out that they lived in Iraq Noone quite knew what happened to them but she kept hearing that they had been caught in a blast from an IED This was a wakeup call to her She started to get involved and by the time James met her she was one of the senior staff for a congressional campaign By just being exposed to one another By interacting and learning about eachother's lives We can see the similarities between us, and find compassion through sharing play In our games we can connect in a much realer way than by seeing some abstract statistic on the news Or, as is the case for many by simply hearing the opinions of those around us And in our modern world of esports we may yet be able to carry this further Actually sending teams around the world to be watched by tens of thousands as they compete By having exhibitions and competitions where our most famous esports stars engage with players from around the world and interact with them with respect and dignity We can connect to people and cultures we might never otherwise get to interact with We can come to understand them, not as foreign, but as human In all of the ways that they are both similar and unique And with professional players being traded across borders and with all regions being watched internationally we can create heroes and sports stars who don't look or sound like us Who young people can look up to regardless of what nation they're from But for all of this hope, there is still a downside Everybody watching this knows that online spaces can just as easily serve to reinforce stereotypes and serve as gathering points for the bigotted and the closed minded Where in the past, professional athletes competed with each other as professionals with sportsmanship and dignity Today we take the competition directly into our own hands sometimes forgoing that mutual respect that comes from two professionals competing at the top of their craft Private competition can just as easily devolve into toxicity and counterproductive antagonism If we want to use this incredible tool to its utmost, We have got to be more vigilant against this As an industry, we have got to more carefully curate the spaces we create and give our players the tools necessary to build communities and as individuals, we need to be ready to reach out to those that we encounter in our games that come from around the globe To be that welcoming voice so that we can learn just a little more about them Even if it's just learning what brings them to our server and of course, I'm not saying that professional sports are perfect either, Gender balance and sexuality and a whole host of major issues still persist, even in the Olympics where they've had a committee specifically built to address problems like these since the 90s and yes, I admit that I am painting a very optimistic picture here but, We have been handed an incredible tool in online gaming and we can use this tool that we all enjoy so much to communicate, to create shared experiences and through doing so, to foster understanding It is just on us to reach out See you next week! ♪ ♪ ♪ [English Subtitles by Assume Correct] ♪ ♪ ♪ "
41,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,auDqJuVE7Xc," Every year, right around GDC, I see a number of articles titled, ""The future of the Games Industry is..."" ""...fill in the blank."" These usually come with big sweeping predictions, like... ""GameStop will be dead by 2017"", or... ""We'll be playing all of our games on VR headsets..."" ""...while suspended from wires in a human Hamster ball to give us the illusion of lifelike motion."" ""Gray is the new brown,"" and so on. Lots of grand, far-reaching claims that are more possibilities than certainties. So instead, I'd like to make a handful of smaller predictions today. These aren't huge trends that are going to radically change the way you play games. They're not as sweeping as the mobile revolution, or even the growth of eSports. Rather, they're subtle shifts in the way we think about making or selling games that will quietly, but indelibly change the way we create and experience them. PREDICTION # 1: More games coming from Asia. As the Japanese market struggles to realign itself and search for new customers... As the Korean games industry continues to grow in the competitive and online world... As the Chinese industry moves to console and continues to increase production costs... The amount of games from these countries that end up translated and in western markets will continue to grow. Specifically, experiments like Xenoblade Chronicles and the re-release of Suikoden 2 on PSN... ...have shown Japanese game developers that there's a market for these games in the West. And the AAA game industry in Japan is currently in crisis mode as game budgets begin to eclipse what the domestic market can bear. This upheaval is starting to force companies to take a gamble and over the next few years... One of the clear gambles we're gonna see the Japanese market take is an attempt to maximize revenue in the West. Korea, on the other hand, has been a growing force in the game industry for a decade now. But as western players become more comfortable with microtransactions - a monetization method Korea pioneered, by the way... And as the United States and Europe develop the infrastructure to really support high-level competitive gaming... We're gonna see more Korean games enter the US and EU marketplaces. The Chinese game industry is actually quite large already, but until now, it's been primarily focused on the mobile space and MMOs. With the end of the console ban in China and the success some Chinese companies like Tencent already had in the US... We're gonna see Chinese companies not only try to acquire western developers... But also try to launch larger Chinese games outside of the local market. Keep an eye out. PREDICTION NUMBER #2: More satisfying short play sessions in AAA games. I don't mean that our 80-hour RPGs are going anywhere. Just that developers are starting to focus more on making sure the player gets something satisfying out of 30-minute chunks of gameplay. Rather than having to sit down for two hours at least to get through a dungeon or resolve the next plot point. The AAA game industry has actually learned a great deal from the mobile space over the last few years... And one of the positive things we've adopted is the tendency to start thinking about session length. As the audience for AAA games gets older... And as even our younger players have more and more options available to them for what to do with their time... Designers can no longer get away with expecting the player to play for a minimum of an hour or two hours in one sitting. And don't worry: this doesn't mean that those games we love playing for hours on end are going away either. I'm just saying that in the future, you can probably expect to be able to get a more satisfying experience out of your game in just a half an hour session. Shadow of Mordor is actually a good example of this. You can totally binge on it for hours... But there's always something rewarding to do, even if you've only got thirty minutes. PREDICTION #3: The death of the in-house engine. There's long been a debate within the AAA industry as to whether the flexibility and the power of a custom built engine... ...outweighs the cost savings and production streamlining of just licensing an existing engine from somebody else. What the correct answer was generally came down to the needs of the particular game. But it looks like we might have finally crossed a threshold where the vast majority of the time, even for AAA games... Licensing an engine is the better choice. The power of today's engines is just unbelievable. What engines like Unreal and Unity provide out-of-the-box is almost mine-shattering to anybody who started development in the PS2 era. But it's not actually an advance in engine power that's really changing things. It's advances in usability, coupled with how ubiquitous these engines have become. Because these engines have become easier to use and simultaneously, more people have gotten experience using them... Building your game in one of these pre-made engines not only saves you the cost of developing an engine... ...but also the cost of training, new hires and how to use it. Now you can get everything and everyone up and running way faster. Not as much knowledge is lost when people decide to change jobs. And teams can work together more efficiently than ever as more people have a solid understanding of the pipeline. What does this mean for consumers? Well, not a whole lot, really. This one's more of an industry-facing change. At most, you can expect to notice each of these engines individual quirks a bit more frequently. Today's engines have become flexible enough that it shouldn't affect what types of games get created or what ideas get released. But it might constrain design in some small, small ways. PREDICTION #4: More spin-offs using existing assets. Assets, or stuff like 3D models, and textures, animations, sound, just all the stuff... ...have become a larger and larger percentage of game budgets, in both the AAA space and in the mobile and tablet worlds. And the companies have started to look for ways to offset these costs. One of the ways we're gonna see more often in the near future is the creation of spin-off and ancillary games... ...that use previously created assets, originally developed for tent-pole AAA titles. Say you just built a 50 million dollar Assassin's Creed game. Why not reuse some of those assets to build another smaller title? Perhaps a side story for the series, at a much lower cost? Still got a bunch of low poly assets from one of your last-gen entries in the series? How about using them to make an Assassin's Creed tablet game? Or what about audio files? There must be tons of great music and sound-effect in that series archive by now. I bet they'd sound great in that Assassin's Creed mobile game you're developing. Beyond this, we're also gonna see more digital backlighting. Did your studio just build a huge open-world game? Why spend a ton of money remaking all those rocks and trees for your next title? Why not just drop in the rocks and trees you've already got, especially if you're working in the same engine? Buildings, weapons, furniture, all sorts of assets can be reused this way. And if your company happens to have three different first-person shooters in development at the same time... Heck, you might even be able to get away with sharing some of the generic enemies. This is the sort of thinking we're seeing more and more of. I know these may not be the most exciting observations about things that are changing in the games industry... And hey, maybe later we'll put together an episode about some of the larger changes that are happening. But in a season where GDC, PAX East, South by Southwest and all these other conventions tends to stir up a lot of noise... We figured we'd just take a moment to talk about some of the changes that might easily fly under the radar. While a lot of the big predictions tend to highlight things that never really materialize, or that fizzle out... It's the small changes like these that are really happening, that slowly shift what and how we play. See you next week. "
42,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,dW-gw5fS6jw,"When I was young, the only way to play a game with a friend was to be sitting on the couch next to them, or gathered with them around the table. You had to be sharing an arcade cabinet, or hanging out at your local game store. You played face to face. Today, this isn't the case. [Theme Music] Today almost no triple-A game comes out with local multiplayer. And even those that do often consider it an afterthought. A secondary mode to online play and the truth is, there is a good business reason for this. I mean, I am pro-local multiplayer but I won't sugarcoat it. Companies long ago learned that they lose very few sales by not including local multiplayer. First of all, very few people won't actually buy a game simply because it doesn't have local multiplayer. But they may grumble about it, they may be unhappy, but if it's game you're jazzed about or a series that you love, in general you'll probably suck it up and play over the internet with your friends. Second, the amount of sales they lose is actually offset by the number of sales they gain. I mean if a game has local multiplayer that often means that two or more players only have to buy one copy of the game to play together. But if a game doesn't have local multiplayer, every single person who wants to play has to actually buy a copy. So all of your friends have to buy it, if you want to play together and the company has managed to sell two or more copies where they would have only sold one. Now there are some counter arguments to be made to that logic. For one, local multiplayer makes it easy to introduce new people to a game. Local multiplayer games are also better candidates for DLC as there will be some friendly peer pressure to pick that stuff up. But those aren't the reasons I'm going to talk about because I think they're less important and ultimately less convincing. For all the business reasons to remove local multiplayer, there's one compelling reason to keep it. Local multiplayer made us better people. I think some of the toxicity that we so often wrestle with today comes from the fact that we no longer play games face-to-face. It was a lot harder to curse somebody out or to fling racial epithets at somebody when you were sitting right next to them. It was harder even to be mad at the them, much less stay that way. When we played with each other in a real proximal sense, we got to know each other and we had to accept each other as human beings. Other players weren't just faceless entities on the internet, they were people, just like you. Empathy was practically unavoidable. I mean, sure, there would be those times where a heated match got a little bit ragey, but that rarely lasted long. And more often grudging congratulations on a win or a heartfelt ""maybe next time"" on a loss were readily given. And when all was said and done, you broke bread or probably pizza, and whatever frustrations there were slipped away. And some of my best friendships were formed in that environment. Sitting around a table playing Magic or D&amp;D, spending hours trying to grind through Gain Ground on the Genesis. And man, so many hours in Golden Eye. And while I have found great people and made great friends playing online. It's never quite as natural or as easy as it was over a game of Smash or Mario Kart. Now sometimes when I've brought this up, I've had people push back and say, ""Dude, look at the fighting game community, its all local play and there's a lot of toxicity there!"" And yes, there is toxicity in parts of the fighting game community and there's work that needs to be done there, but I've also seen the fighting game community especially in local tournaments be one of the most welcoming and open groups I've ever encountered. I've seen old hands happily take their time to train new players. I've seen lines of race disappear. I've seen people from all walks of life bond over those machines. And way back before there was a pro scene, when you had to put a quarter on a cabinet to play; it was an even more welcoming community. Crushing losses and frustration just melted away in the face of our shared joy in these games. Luckily, today's indie community has started to create more of these experiences. Maybe out of nostalgia or maybe out of an interest in exploring the unique type of play that comes when people play together in a room. or maybe even just so they don't have to deal with the problem of rendering two perspectives on a screen, when you're already pushing a machine to its limits. These have been great to see and I hope its leads to a resurgence in these types of games in general But as we see local multiplayer falling out of the Triple A space, I just wanted to take a moment and say that for all the expense, for all the hassle of putting in local multiplayer, it does have a value that's not so easily quantified. And not every game should have it, in fact most games probably shouldn't. But for those that it's perfect for, it's worth remembering that it makes our community better as a whole. It helps to forge friendships and create bonds. But more than that, it helps to remind us that we're all humans. That on the other side of that wire is not just some faceless bot or some outlet for meanness and frustration and rage. It's another person who loves the same thing you do. I'll see you all next week. [Outro Song] "
43,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,kNscZCrke4k,"James has a very strange supposition about how to teach game design to somebody who's never done it before. And I don't mean teach in the casual sense, I mean like teaching in a formal setting at the university level, because as many schools as we have out there offering game design programs, most of them are still trying to figure out this problem: how do you properly teach game design? ♫ [Intro Music] ♫ James had so many students come up to him and say ""My schooling didn't really prepare me for the life I wanted. It didn't really prepare me to be a game designer"" and it's led him to wonder if perhaps we need to take a whole new approach to how we do this. More than this though, it's also the fact that he's had more and more professionals come up to him lately saying that when hiring for junior positions, they don't put any special emphasis on people who have a game design degree because many of the people they've hired from game design programs haven't proven to be better candidates. In fact, they've often proven to be less adaptable than those with other educational backgrounds. Overall, it's really made him question how we go about educating designers, and after putting a lot of thought into it, the strange hypothesis he's come up with is that we are perhaps teaching too much game at game schools. I know that sounds odd, but hear me out. We learned long ago that we shouldn't just teach designers tools and software, game engines and 3d software; a game designer should be able to pick those up on the job. Every company I've ever worked for has had its own unique scripting language, or at least its own crazy additions and modifications to the tools they use, so simply learning a piece of software isn't enough, because tools change constantly and they're not universally applicable. If you've learned Maya, but then you find yourself working on a 2d mobile game, well, Maya's not gonna do you much good. If you learned Unreal 3 a mere half decade ago, that knowledge is practically worthless today. So much of the industry has moved on to other engines and even those using Unreal now are working with such a radically different version that what one might have actually learned in classes on Unreal 3 doesn't have a lot of application today. And most schools have realized this. They stopped just teaching tools long ago. Instead, they went on to teach courses like level design and game balancing. But here's the thing: level design and game balancing are actually just tools as well. They aren't fundamentals. They aren't the key skills that a designer needs to be a good designer. James talked about this at GDC, and in preparing to do so, he asked many of the professional designers he knew what they really look for in a fellow designer, and it basically boiled down to these things: First: communication. You need the ability to express the design to members of all the different departments clearly and concisely. Second: collaboration. You need to be able to work with people from many different fields and with many different mindsets. The ability to take feedback and to really incorporate it in your design. Third: a love of learning. You need the ability to be able to pick new things up quickly because different projects will require developing an in-depth knowledge of different things. You might have to learn about the flowers of the English countryside or the weapons of World War II, not to mention figuring out the scripting engine and the pipeline and the peculiar quirks of whatever team and studio you're working with. And a designer needs to love doing it to really do the kind of deep dives that allow them to add the little touches that really make a project special. Fourth: scope. You need to be capable of creating realistic design plans and the willingness to cut even the parts you personally love the most in service of the project as a whole. Fifth: logical thinking. You need to be able to build and work with logical systems, as that's the foundation of most game systems and scripting languages. Sixth: lateral thinking. You need to be able to see problems from a new perspective, and find answers outside of those that are traditionally used. Seventh: a breadth of knowledge. This is the only one on this list that I think is debatable, but most designers I know like to see potential applicants have knowledge of things other than just games, as this gives them a greater field to draw from when solving design problems, which in turn leads to better solutions. And if you look at this list you'll see one commonality: none of those things are really game specific skills. It doesn't matter if you're coming in as a level designer or a system designer, I'd rather see that you have good communication and collaboration skills, a sense of scope, and the ability to learn quickly, than to have a level design or system design course on your resume. So as utterly batty as it might sound, in a world where we only have a very limited number of courses to prepare you to be an effective designer, I would rather see us cut the game specific courses from game design degrees if it meant us being able to provide a better grounding in the rest of those skills. If James had to make a guess he would wager that a well formulated game design course would actually look a lot like this: First: a hardcore focus on the liberal arts. And when I say hardcore, I mean challenging to the point where failure is not uncommon. It would include a grounding in the philosophy and literature that makes up the Western tradition along with a focus on Psychology and Mathematics. The variety and volume of the material here would hammer in the ability to rapidly assimilate new materials, and the courses would be taught in a discussion format with regular papers to train up communication skills in both the verbal and written medium. All rote tests and quizzes would be abandoned, as this education is far more concerned with how the students are using and playing with the ideas they are exposed to than with their absolute retention of the details therein. Additionally, the pillar of mathematics in the course would be strong with at least one math class per semester. This encourages logical thinking and give students the one almost universally applicable design skill. Next, one to two courses in formalized logic would also be a possibility as this also reinforces the logic training and makes the jump to scripting easier for designers who don't have much experience with scripting languages. And then, anchoring the program, each semester would have an underlying mega course project course that all students must take where they actually make games. Every semester, month in and month out, every month they're there. The best way to learn to make games is to make them. This course would be given at least twice the credit hours of most courses, and students would be expected to spend a fair amount of time outside the class on this course. In this course, the students would work in teams, preferably interdisciplinary teams if the school can support that, to create a game that integrates an idea or topic from the other courses. This would build collaboration skills, teach scope, and build lateral thinking muscles as the constraint of having to incorporate elements from their core liberal arts courses will force them to rethink traditional game genres, or force them out of established genres entirely. Such a degree would probably preclude large class sizes and would require someone with a fair amount of development experience to mentor the students in the project course, but if that could be achieved, it would produce far more adaptable designers that are far better prepared for the industry and far more desirable as potential employees. Way more so than those that simply have a smattering of game balancing courses to their name. ♫ [Outro Music Begins] ♫ Anyway, I hope that sparked some ideas. ♫ [Outro Music Continues] ♫ Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next week. ♫ [Outro Music Continues] ♫ ♫ [Outro Music] ♫ "
44,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,ntpZt8eAvy0," Quality Assurance is a frequently misunderstood, often maligned branch of the games industry. But more goes into testing than even some industry folks realize. Also. This is Josh. He's doing the art today, so say hi. Intro Music From the outside people often mistake game testing for playing games all day until something breaks. But really much of the tester's job happens outside the game itself. To do this topic justice we have brought in veteran QA specialist David Guilland to help us explain the various kinds of quality assurance jobs out there, QA's future, and how games testing is a literal science. First, let's talk about how testing works. The simplest way that a tester finds bugs is the same way that players do: they play the game until something breaks. This is called ad hoc testing and it's what most outsiders imagine the entire QA job to be, but this type of testing is actually fairly rare. QA folks don't just play games aimlessly. They go in there with a laser focus on specific scenarios. If they're testing an RTS, maybe they'll be tasked with using every unit on every map. For a shooter, maybe they'll have to fire every gun and make sure it goes pew pew. But breaking the game is actually where the job starts. Once a tester finds a bug it's important that they be able to describe exactly what happened, where, and when. But even more so it's important that they be able to explain why. And while it is impossible for a tester to have a master level understanding of the game's programming, scripting, and art, most of the time you can use deductive reasoning to come to a pretty good guess as to why a bug might have occurred. Enter the scientific method. As a tester it is your job to gather evidence, form hypotheses, and then test those hypotheses until you can formulate a working theory of that bug's source Imagine you're testing a level. You jump over a fence and you see an enemy. You shoot it in the foot and... the game crashed. All right, why exactly did the game crash? Was it jumping over the fence that did it? Maybe that was a place the player wasn't supposed to be able to reach. Or maybe it was something to do with the enemy AI Or one of literally hundreds of other systems that could easily crash even a simple game So you start to gather evidence. You try to repeat exactly what you did leading up to the bug as closely as possible, just like when scientists repeat experiments to gather more data. Then, once you've done that for a while and can reliably reproduce the results of your experiment, in this case the game crashing, you can then try to isolate which variable is responsible. So you mix things up a bit. Maybe you shoot the enemy with a different weapon, or you lob a grenade instead so you don't have to jump over the fence first. Your goal is to find the shortest, most precise number of steps that will reliably reproduce the bug. These are what are called ""repro steps"". Then once you have those, you can file a bug in the database where it'll be handed off to somebody on the development team to fix. Then eventually, once the dev has checked in a fix for the problem, that report will come back to you as resolved, at which point it's up to you to go verify that fix and either close the ticket, or send it back to the developer to be fixed again. So how does one get in to quality assurance? When it comes to breaking into the industry most of these discipline specific episodes have focused on the skills needed for that discipline. But this one's gonna be a little bit different. See, just landing any games testing job isn't super hard. Heck, some testing labs out there will hire anybody who can pass a drug test. A lot of these employers will promise an exciting industry job, saying, ""Come on, play games for a living!"" before dropping those new hires in front of a game and just expecting bugs to pop out this is kind of like being offered the role of a swashbuckling pirate, only to end up chained to an oar and rowing for eternity. Do not work at these places, I promise it's not worth it They may seem like a good place to get your foot in the door, but they often don't give you any of the skills or connections you'll need to be successful in a long term testing or game development career. Besides, QA doesn't have to be a miserable job. Testing is probably the most varied discipline in the games industry, and the best way to find a gig you're happy with is to connect with the right team. A lot of people make the rookie mistake of applying only to studios that make their favorite games. But imagine watching your favorite movie two or three times a day every day for a year I don't care who you are, no one like Star Wars that much. Prioritise team over title. You'll be glad you did. Better still, find a QA job where you'll be working in the same building as the developers. Half the job is really about communicating, and being able to meet with developers in person will let you create the working relationships you need to be truly productive. Unfortunately, QA is often the first group of people to be outsourced to another office, or even another country, especially as dev teams become increasingly globalized. This results in a lot of developers never getting to know the people who send them bugs, and even viewing them in an adversarial manner. If you've been working 60 hour weeks for three months trying to implement a feature, only to get sent a bunch of bugs from some anonymous tester living in a city you've never heard of, it's pretty easy to start getting irritable. Likewise, it's easy for testers to start taking it personally when developers or producers decide not to fix their bugs. Obviously development resources aren't infinite and everybody's got deadlines, But testers can grow attached to their bugs in much the same way that developers grow attached to their own work. And if you have spent days perfectly reproducing and documenting a problem that the developer then says they won't be fixing, it's easy to get cranky. But that's just a bug in human nature, so try not to be that coworker. Anyway, now that you know what a QA person does and how to find a good QA job, Let's talk about the future of testing Games QA is shifting very quickly right now. Some studios like Valve don't even have dedicated testers. Instead the developers spend a portion of each week playing the game, discussing it, and calling out any bugs they see. It's always been a standard part of the development process to a certain extent. But it's increasingly becoming part of the quality assurance process at other studios as well, both large and small Combine that with the increasing use of automation and testing and I suspect that those large testing pens I warned you about earlier will start looking a lot smaller in five to ten years. Now don't get me wrong, there will probably always be a handful of dedicated testers working on any large project. But the brute force demand for armies of inexperienced testers is likely going to decline with time. But, that said, it's still a great time to hone your skills and become one of the experienced testers, because QA can be incredibly rewarding Taking a level or a feature you've been assigned and working to make it as polished as it can be is often just as fulfilling for the tester as a bit of brilliant design, code, or art can be to a dev. QA is a difficult career. A lot of testers either transition to different game dev disciplines or leave the industry entirely before too long. But if you find a good fit on the right team, this game career can be as rewarding and satisfying as any other. Thanks again to David and Josh for the help, we'll see you next week. Outro Music "
45,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,r9ExIKYZd6o,"James had the strangest experience with Yakuza Zero. The game was about 30% cutscene the way he played it And. he. didn't. mind? ♪♪ Cutscenes have long been a whipping boy of game design. We joke about Kajima and Naughty Dog games just being movies. We groan when any game is released with cutscenes that you can't skip. In fact, among designers, cutscenes have been seen as an inherently flawed design element for so long, That it's sort of become a mantra. ""Cutscenes are bad, or at least lazy, game design."" ""Never do in a cutscene what you could be doing through gameplay"" And, I get where that's coming from. But if I may just pump the brakes for a moment here, I think it's important to take a step back here and remember that nothing is inherently bad game design. Anything that we can do within a game is a tool. One of many in our designer's toolbelt Now, some of those tools may have incredibly limited applications, And some them can be disastrous when used wrong, But that doesn't mean that we should throw them out entirely. I mean even something as seemingly bad as terrible ragdoll physics Can be harnessed to give us something like Goat Simulator,™ Ant the entire genre of ""comedy physics sims"" around it. So everything has it's uses. With that in mind, I think it's time we take a second look at cutscenes, and just for the sake of clarity, Let's define the cutscene in this case as: A portion of a game where control is taken away from a player so that a video can play out. Maybe it's pre-rendered, maybe it's all happening in-engine, but the player is just sitting and watching, pressing no buttons while a little movie plays. Now, for one thing, I think there's a case to be made for the merit of the film-game hybrid like Metal Gear Solid™, or Uncharted™. we readily embrace book-game hybrids in the form of the visual novel, so why shut the door on games built with cutscenes as part of their core experience? But, I realize that's sort of sidestepping the whole discussion. So, let's just tackle that designer mantra head on. ""Don't do with a cutscene, what you could do with gameplay."" Alright, but what if a cutscene CAN do something that your gameplay can't? Think back to what cutscenes did for us in the old days. Why did we start using them to begin with? Well, in an era where real-time graphics capabilities were incredibly limited, cutscenes allowed us to show things that we could never do justice to in-engine. But lets go a little deeper. If you go all the way back the the days of Final Fantasy VII™, The game that launched a thousand cutscenes, What did those cutscenes often show? Well, sometimes they showed establishing shots of your location. Other times they highlighted key story elements, but most often, they showed you action. Mako Reactors exploding. Cloud jumping on a train amidst a hail of gunfire. Your party making a daring escape as a city collapses around them. They show the characters doing amazing things, way cooler than anything that happens during gameplay. And that trend continued as the series grew. Cutscenes showed your characters rail grinding down airship cables, fighting in epic battles, or matrixing their way through train cars full of heavily armed guards, and the goal in all of this was to give the imagination a crutch. After all, final fantasy combat wasn't super exciting to look at. But when you pressed the buttons to choose attack commands from a menu, this was what you were supposed to imagine. When you used your small handful of moves over, and over, and over again to fight back waves of generic enemies, You were supposed to envision it as the sort of action spectacle you saw in those cutscenes. Cutscenes attempted to bridge the gap, To help you imagine a spectacle that the game just wasn't capable of. But this sort of backfired. As players, you watched those cutscenes and you think ""I wanna do that, I want this game to be that"", Creating this expectation of the gameplay experience, and setting you up for disappointment every time you went back to... this. So we started trying to figure out: ""How do we make our gameplay look like this?"" We tried turning action cutscenes into Quick-time events, to make them at least somewhat interactive. We started making heavily scripted, action set piece sequences to help make certain segments of our gameplay feel like those cutscenes looked. Even Final Fantasy™ has strived, and succeeded to a degree, in making their gameplay combat more like the spectacle you saw in their cutscenes. Heck, NaughtyDog has nearly perfected the art of transitioning between cutscene and gameplay, So that the player is given control over as many of the exciting action moments as possible, without breaking the flow of things. Slowly over the years, we've tried to transition all of that cutscene action spectacle, into gameplay action spectacle. We've been reasonably successful in this effort over the years, and I think it's been a change for the better. In fact, I am prepared to go out on a limb here, and say that, in most cases, We should not ever be using cutscenes for action sequences. Sure, sometimes those scenes are cool, but they just invoke in the player the sense of wanting to do rather than just see. Which of course leaves us asking: ""What should we be using cutscenes for?"" And to that, I answer, The thing we used them for originally. That which our gameplay or graphics cannot do. So, let's go back to Yakuza Zero for a minute. Playing the game, you might notice that many of the cutscenes aren't just action sequences. The game lets the player handle all of the action stuff. It lets them do the flips and the kicks and the punches  and feel like a yakuza while doing it And why not? Today's games can deliver on action spectacle like never before. No, Yakuza [Zero]'s cutscenes are saved for the quieter moments, moments that show off subtlety of character that we simply couldn't as clearly express through gameplay. A flicker of a facial expression, or, drawing attention to the way someone nervously adjusts their tie in a tense conversation. Yakuza [Zero] uses its cutscenes to round out and fully realize its characters in ways its gameplay cannot. Without cutscenes, the Yakuza Zero experience would actually lose a great deal. And that, I believe, is the way that we should treat the cutscene going forward Not as the shortcut to spectacle but to subtlety. Because quiet character emotion can be incredibly difficult to deliver on within the confines of gameplay. At least, right now. And in those places where our gameplay cannot deliver, Sometimes the humble cutscene might just be the best tool for the job. Always be wary of accepting conventional design wisdom as design law. Don't just write off a potentially useful tool as inherently bad design, or as a lazy way to approach problems just because it's fallen out of favor. Instead, ask, ""how can this be applied?"" and ""In what scenario would this tool be ideal?"" Sure, conventional wisdom is often conventional for a reason. Cutscenes may be a terrible choice in many cases, but if we just throw out a tool like cutscenes entirely, We only hamstring ourselves. See ya next week! ♪♪ "

Download the game for free at the link below and use the code ""EXTRATANKS1"" for a free starter pack. So let's take a look at these two titles. Dragon Quest was the first major JRPG, and the series as a whole pretty much wrote the book of the genre as we know it, not to mention had a pretty sweet Nintendo Power magazine tie-in from when I was a kid. While the original DOOM popularized the FPS genre in pretty much the same way. Dragon Quest I was released in 1986, while DOOM I was released in 1993. And Dragon Quest XI and the new DOOM released in 2017 and 2016, over thirty and twenty years later respectively. But both of these games look, But both of these games look, feel, But both of these games look, feel, and play But both of these games look, feel, and play very much like their original releases. And that is a good thing. Because both games know exactly what their audience is looking for from them. And they focus on delivering that specific experience in their own way, rather than pivoting to follow industry trends. If you look at any critical review of any Dragon Quest game, one of the most common complaints you'll read is: ""The games don't change much"". But ask a Dragon Quest fan what it is they like about the series, and one of the common positives they'll cite is: ""The games don't change much""! The series has resisted the urge many other franchises feel, JRPGs in particular, to constantly change up their mechanics, in an attempt to attract a larger audience. These changes are usually things like adding more action and eye-popping visuals, rather than enhancing the narrative that narrative and fantasy that made the genre so popular in the first place. DOOM, on the other hand, engages players in a completely different way than Dragon Quest. Because DOOM is about intense, awesome fire fights and gory spectacle. But the series was bogged down for years by focusing on elements that weren't really core to that experience. Next-gen lighting effects, Next-gen lighting effects, piling on plot, Next-gen lighting effects, piling on plot, and hit-or-miss attempts at survival horror. But when it committed to delivering a new game that hearkened back to the original DOOM from 1993, it allowed the series to once again focus on what DOOM does best: Giving you a shotgun, and pointing you towards, *Metal* T H E   L E G I O N S   O F   H E L L !!! *heavy coughing* 'Scuse me. These two games stayed their course, without tacking on all of the these that many other franchises have tried to cram in, for fear of being left behind. They both have many modernizations, of course, which are essential to allow an audience seven gaming generations later to enjoy the core experience these games introduced so many many years ago. But at a fundamental level, they remained committed to what made the games that launched these series so compelling. For the perfect foil for Dragon Quest, you need look no further than its distaff counterpart: Final Fantasy. Both series became popular due to the strengths of their narrative, but Final Fantasy has suffered when the teams behind it maybe started to focus on the wrong things. Gaming is a tough industry that's always been hit-driven. And it's easy, especially when building a big-budget game, to look at what's been selling well recently and think if you don't give players that experience then no one will buy your game. As the ever-growing pile of Battle Royale shooters can attest to. I mean, seriously, Zoe can't swing a dead person without hitting a new one of those things. Of course, sometimes, change is for the better. Mixing up genres or livening up old ideas with new twists has led to many advances in the media. But it's important to evaluate if those new ideas complement the existing game mechanics people love and expect from a franchise, or are they just thrown in because other games are doing them? DOOM's use of light RPG progression, for example, supplements the main action. By getting the player's incentives to experiment with different weapon types, it forces the running and shooting game to be more varied and interesting. Throwing in a modern cover  system, on the other hand, would've slammed the brakes hard on the fast-paced gameplay that makes DOOM feel like DOOM. And likewise, skill-heavy real-time combat in Dragon Quest XI would've caused a huge shift away from the chill vibes and accessibility  that Dragon Quest games are famous for. Unfortunately though, unlike Dragon Quest XI and DOOM, all too often games from established franchises do get rebuilt around new trends and end up disregarding the original elements that fans loved about the series. Innovation is vital in our industry. and you've heard us champion it here again and again. We need to experiment to find new kinds of games and new ways to play. But, it's important that it's actual innovation, based out of a desire to create new experiences, and push boundaries of what we can do in the media. And not simply tacking on mechanics from the latest hits on the beloved franchises, because we think having ""Battle Royale"" as a bullet point will add to sales. Remember why people loved your series in the first place. Build on that! You might find out the the best way to do that is by expanding the gameplay with all sorts of new elements. Or, you might find that the best way to go is just to stick to your guns and deliver more of the same. Not the DOOM guns specifically, mind you, I meant retaining the game's original spirit, which, uhm, in DOOM's case, those specific guns they're still sticking to are in fact the guns they are sticking to. But, uhm, boy, I think I just [inception-ed?] my example here, uhhh... Zoe, spin the top for me, I'm gonna go lie down. [DON'T LEAVE YET!] But BEFORE I do that, I'd like to to once again thank World of Tanks for sponsoring this episode! They've been sticking with their guns both literally and figuratively with their game for over eight years now, and, TANK-fully, eh? they are showing no signs of slowing down. *WoT gameplay* So if you'd like to get in on some o' that action, download the game for free at the link below, and use the invite code ""EXTRATANKS1"" to claim your free starter pack!

47,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,sumZLwFXJqE,"MMOs suffer from a strange problem, at least in a real world economic sense. Everybody is printing money all the time. For years, every massive multiplayer game has struggled with this. And as any old school MMO player will tell you, the results were as devastating as they often were hilarious. But of late, games have stolen a very real world economic solution. We've covered this a bit before, but basically every time you kill a monster in an MMO it drops money or a piece of loot that a vendor can conveniently convert to money for you. This money doesn't come from anywhere. There's not a limited supply of it at all. Rather, it's just magically created every time you win a fight. And with hundreds of thousands of players killing monsters 24 hours a day, 365 days a year that's a lot of money being constantly added to the economy. Imagine what this would do to a real world economy. Imagine if rather than your central bank having the exclusive right to print money and keeping careful tabs on how much money is out there, everybody was just printing money all the time. You would hit hyperinflation pretty fast The value of the currency would plummet and the loaf of bread that costs five dollars one day would cost 50 the next week. And then 5,000. And then people would just stop accepting money for bread altogether. Your currency would be effectively worthless. And that is exactly what happens in most MMOs. In Asheron's Call, the in-game currency became so inflated that shards were used as money. In Diablo 2, stones of Jordan rapidly replaced gold. And in Gaia Online, the currency became so worthless that the company started offering to donate two hundred and fifty dollars to charity every time the players threw away 15 trillion gold. Players just abandoned the designated currency and chose a different, more restricted currency because they could no longer trust the initial game currency to retain any value at all. And this has a devastating impact on these games. It makes the game less approachable for new players. It means that returning players come back to a now worthless bank account. It makes it harder for players to exchange goods, and in some poorly supported MMOs, it's even rendered the in-game auction house unusable. So of course, there were all sorts of ways we always used to try to design around this. We would put money sinks in the game. Things like auction house fees, vendor-only consumable items that were practically necessary to play. Guild dues, or even property tax for owning in-game real estate. Those sinks were designed to remove currency from the game. When you paid for any of those items or services, the money you paid with simply vanished, which theoretically would have a deflationary effect. But as we all know when it comes to MMO players there is practically no money sink you can build that's going to exceed how much people are willing to grind. And even if you could get close, well that could hurt your economy, too. And honestly, it might make your game less engaging to play if the player feels like they're spending all of their time just paying fees. It's not really why we play games. But lately it seems like designers have discovered another solution. A reserve currency. In the real world, almost every nation holds onto a bunch of currency from other countries to serve as a reserve currency. This reserve currency is used for international transactions, but far more importantly to us, it's used to anchor the local currency. Because, after all, if you have 500 billion dollars in the bank and you tell everybody that they can trade 50 of your currency for one u.s. dollar well then the least your currency is worth is 2 cents. It can't go below that so long as you've got some of your reserve currency left. If your currency starts to inflate, then people start to trade in your local money for the reserve currency, effectively creating a floor for what your currency is worth so long as you still have a supply of the reserve currency. So how does this work in MMOs? Well of late, many MMOs have started to allow players to buy things of real-world value with in-game currency, like Plex in EVE Online. Many of the free-to-play MMOs have gone one step even further and let players buy their microtransaction currency -- the currency that has to be bought with real money -- from other players for currency earned in game. By tying the in-game currency to real world currency, which has real value, the in-game currency now can't lose all of its value. But that alone didn't end up being enough to prevent hyperinflation in a lot of these games, so two other aspects, somewhat lifted from how real world reserve currencies work, were put into place in order to overcome the infinite money printing that MMOs naturally engage in. The first is illiquidity. In the real world, reserve currencies can't really be traded among the local populace. Like if you go to China, even though the Chinese keep huge amounts of US dollars as reserve currency, you can't really simply trade US dollars for things on the street. You usually need to convert your money into yuan first. And while clearly this is not a hundred percent true in the real world because the real world basically breaks every rule at some point, you can make it a hundred percent true in games because you set the rules of that world. You can prevent players from trading the purchased currency. Players can convert their earned currency to purchased currency, but that currency can't then be traded to players except by converting it back to earn currency through the same system. The purchased currency can only ever be spent. You know what, this would actually probably be easier to follow if I had named these currencies and gave some examples or something. So, let's call the currency you earn in-game by killing monsters and stuff silver pieces, and the currency that you've gotta pay real money for, those are diamonds. In our hypothetical game, you can use the game's currency exchange to, let's say, pay 10,000 silver pieces to buy a hundred diamonds. Once you've done that, you either have to spend those 100 diamonds in the in-game store, thereby permanently removing those diamonds from the economy, or you can just sell the diamonds to somebody else for 10,000 silver to get your money back. You can't ever use diamonds to buy things from players. Like, you can't offer to buy somebody's Epic Sword of Awesomeness using your newly acquired diamonds because if you could do that, diamonds would just become the new currency and people would abandon silver entirely. But, because there's a whole host of items that you can't buy with diamonds, even players with a lot of money to spend on the game still need to earn that in-game silver, and thus will trade their diamonds for it. In our real-world analog, buying something with diamonds is basically like buying something from a foreign market. That money leaves the economy, but in return you get a good or a service that you couldn't purchase locally. But clearly in this scenario, if silver is added to the world faster than diamonds, the price of silver to diamonds will inflate. Creating a reserve currency might help you avoid the problem of silver becoming totally worthless, but you haven't yet prevented crippling inflation. To do that, you need to take one more step. And that is setting a maximum limit on how much a diamond can cost. Back when we used the gold standard in the real world which we talked about a little bit in this Extra History series on paper money, and gold was used as the reserve currency internationally, nations would just set a fixed price for how much an ounce of gold was worth. They would say, alright the government says you can always trade 23 US dollars for an ounce of gold. And all of a sudden, the very least a dollar could be worth. Or put another way, the most it could inflate to is 120 third of an ounce of gold. Now in the real world, there's all sorts of problems and complications with this that involve the limit on the gold supply and how hard it is to respond to economic shocks when you have declared your currency worth a certain amount of gold, but we don't have to deal with any of that in games. And this form of currency reserve was really really good at one thing: keeping inflation down. Now, because money is still being perpetually printed in your game, you are still gonna need money sinks. And even with those, because there are items that simply can't be bought with diamonds, some inflation is going to occur. But, with these systems in place, instead of hitting hyperinflation, you'll get something much closer to the rational real-world inflation that comes with an expanding economy. And while there are a million other complexities with reserve currencies that I've not been able to even scratch the surface of in this 10-minute video, and because there's other weirdness with MMOs that throws a bit of a wrench into the whole thing, this stuff isn't a magic bullet. It's not a perfect solution. But by stealing one of the quintessential economic tools that makes our real-world run, we are one huge step closer to solving one of the oldest problems in MMO design. See you next time! "
48,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,syXYISF82k8,"Tabletop role-playing games allow us to step into a realm that's not our own. They can be exciting and thrilling, letting us push our boundaries and explore things we'd never get to experience in real life. But sometimes the thrill can turn to a bit of a chill as events of the story end up making other players uncomfortable, which can ruin everyone's enjoyment. So today we're going to talk about how to make your players feel safe during gameplay and why sometimes being a little uncomfortable can actually be a good thing. INTRO In previous tabletop episodes, we've talked a lot about Eddy's work on Pugmire, a light-hearted fantasy game about pets in the distant future, but prior to becoming the prince of puppies, Eddy spent years as the creative lead for a very different kind of game: Vampire the Masquerade. Really, Eddy? Wow man! Teenage goth Matt is bowing down right now. Seriously, props. Sorry back to it. So we've brought him back in because he has a lot of experience working on horror games which deal with dark and controversial topics. He's run games that have made players squirm in their seats, and sometimes that's a good thing, so let's start things off with an analogy: roller coasters. Most people think of roller coasters as fun, but if you described the experience to, I don't know, say, your friendly neighborhood space alien: riding a roller coaster is about hurtling down a very high railroad track at top speed in an open train as you're thrown in a variety of directions, which, if you think about it, doesn't sound like fun so much as sheer terror and during the ride there's a part of you that intellectually understands you'll be fine, but there's another part of you that's a little worried you might die. Playing a game that pushes your personal boundaries can feel the same. Well, maybe not the part about possibly dying, but it can be scary to dredge up the darker parts of your psyche and bring them out for everyone to see. And sometimes it can be cathartic to play through that kind of scenario, or even just be a little evil in a game, because that purging of fear terror or self-loathing that comes from being in a simulated environment that feels dangerous are stressful is really quite safe and that's the key factor rollercoasters have thick belts and heavy metal bars that remind us at all times that were securely strapped in for the ride. Tabletop RPGs need to have the emotional equivalent of safety belts during gameplay, so that players can get the most out of their catharsis without the experience inadvertently plunging over the edge and harming others. And that emotional safety belt is trust. If the players can trust the game master as well as each other, then it's easy for everyone to stretch their personal boundaries and explore things that might be personally valuable for them to explore, and there are several great tools and tips on how you can build that trust at the table. But before we dive into those, I just want to mention real quick that while tabletop role-playing games can absolutely have a therapeutic value, they should never take the place of therapy, even though some therapists are using these kind of games in their own practices. There's actually a great nonprofit organization called the Bodhana Group that explores therapeutic applications of RPGs, and they released a booklet called Wizards, Warriors, &amp; Wellness which gets into all of this more. We put a link to it in the description below because it's fascinating and maybe we'll talk about it some more some other time. Anyway, the first and most obvious tool you can use is communication. Talking about what your game will entail, along with discussing everyone's personal boundaries beforehand, is a fantastic way to start building trust, because, sure it might feel pretty cool to play a jerk for a while, but if you don't talk to your other players or have them on board with your character's potential actions, you can't just abdicate responsibility and say that, ""well that's just what my character would do!!!"" Think of them as emotional warning beacons, letting the players know in advance what kind of content they can expect and also what content they won't see no matter what. It's great to set these boundaries up at the beginning of a game before you start, not only because it hopefully avoids anything that will be a bad experience for the people playing, but it also lets everyone talk in an environment where no one gets defensive because they're getting accused of crossing a line. But not everyone is comfortable with talking about their concerns up front; and of course, something might come up during gameplay that wasn't discussed beforehand. A great way to handle these situations is a tool called the X-Card. Created by John Stavropoulos, the X-Card is a piece of paper with an X on it that's placed in the middle of the table. Whenever anybody at the table feels uncomfortable with the topic at hand, all they have to do is touch or point to the X-Card and that lets everyone know it's time to change the subject. They don't have to explain or justify their concerns; the game master simply moves immediately on to the next scene, or rewinds events and goes in a different direction. The X-Card gives everyone a chance to speak up if the game is pushing their personal boundaries too far. This established rule up front has to be respected though which gets us back to trust. Too many times I've been in a game where players complain that the group's not letting them roleplay, because the group wants their boundaries respected. So in that situation, I'll let you in on a little secret: don't be that player! If you're ever putting your own desires over something that's causing someone else legitimate harm, you're not just playing a jerk; you are a jerk. The other players have to trust that you'll respect their wishes so they can know what you're doing in-character isn't a reflection of you as a person. So when people say they have a boundary, accept it. No amount of staying in-character is ever worth it in a game when it's harming someone in the real world. Finally, reframing a concept in a more positive light can keep the topic on the table without making it offensive. As someone with hearing loss, Eddy is passionate about disability representation, and he sees post-apocalyptic and cyberpunk games as a great way to showcase that. I mean, think about it:how many people in zombie movies are missing a hand or an eye? And really, cyberware is just another form of assistive device. But in both cases, characters in zombie movies or cyberpunk novels are still strong, capable people that incorporate their disability into their personal stories. By shifting the narrative focus so that disabled characters are equally represented as cool and capable, everyone at the table can explore the topic in a more inclusive fashion, and that kind of representation is really important and once again goes back to trust: because a person seeing themselves in the game you're playing says that everyone is welcome at the table, and that their experiences are valid. By putting those disabled characters up as iconic and aspirational people, the group is letting everyone know that disabled people are also aspirational: that what brings them to the table, both figuratively and literally, is interesting and compelling, and disabled players can, in turn, trust that the group values them and their contributions. Having mutual trust at the table means we can use tabletop RPGs to explore ideas that are uncomfortable, from the Holocaust to racism to violence, in a way that's healthy for everyone. And when the game is run safely, we can use these experiences to help us understand how we would confront these things in the real world, and they can give us experiences to share with others once we leave the table--because at the end of the day, those positive experiences are really what role-playing is all about. "
49,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,wu3-BgmiID0,"Alright, time to get into the dungeon below Durlag's Tower Remember that just like last time, we'll be looking at each encounter through the rubric of combat component, narrative component, Puzzle component, and reward component. Alright, so here we go. Room one, the delving room Sometimes as you're designing you have to recognize that one physical space may represent multiple distinct encounters. One, when the player Initially visits it and others when the player returns to it after the contents of the space have changed, or at least after the ways The player can interact with those contents have changed. That's the case with this room. Let's start by looking at the initial encounter: First, its combat component: This encounter actually has no combat Component. The designers know that the player just came from a combat-centric room and so, in order to present a difference in kind they Don't force the player into a fight in this room. So ok narrative component This is a very narrative heavy room most of the environmental storytelling is done by Contrast you were just in what seems to be a fairly run-of-the-mill Cellar you stepped through a secret door and now you're in what appears to be a sumptuous dining hall It kicks the brain it evokes a sense of wonder and curiosity and directs the player to thinking all right Here's where the adventure begins as the player moves left the room sense of Grand opulence gives way to an increasing number of signs of strangeness and decay First, you see mold on the floor, then four dwarves surrounding some sort of giant well or digging contraption and then bodies. Many, many bodies. By putting these elements in the same room and Contrasting them it drives the player to want to know what happened and to want to unravel the mystery of all this strangeness Let's look at the four dwarves in the room they each have a riddle for the player which can only be solved by Interacting with the rest of this floor. These riddles serve as the overarching quest which ties this whole floor together and thus the designers have Placed them in the first room the player will enter But besides being the principal puzzle content for this room, the dwarves' riddle also serves a narrative purpose Not only did they fulfill the general narrative desire for neat text they also give the player an insight in How the Tower's creator Durlag thinks. And though the player may not be aware of this on a conscious level yet These riddles set the tone for the tower The other puzzle aspect to this room is the trap at the outset. Now, Durlag's Tower is very good and an excellent example of design methodology. But that doesn't mean that they get everything right and the designers Reliance on traps to shore up their puzzle aspect is perhaps its weakest element. While there are places that they get some good mileage out Of it the designers ultimately want these traps to function as a puzzle But the way that traps are mechanically handled in Baldur's gate makes them more of a chore than anything else. If you want an interesting Design exercise for later look at how future CRPGs tweaked the Baldur's gate system to make traps less cumbersome and so better able to serve as puzzle components. As for the reward component of this room, the narrative aspects actually serve as the main reward here, and it's important to note that reward in the dungeon doesn't always come in the form of loot or experience. It can be anything that makes the player have a positive experience for besting or properly interacting with a room, but it's also worth noting that there are also a number of consumables found in the room that should help an under stocked party make it through the rest of the tower. By putting these here the designers are using the reward to even out different levels of player preparedness Which allows them to more easily design some of the upcoming Encounters as they know at least some of the tools the players are going to have available to face any challenge They might throw at them. In relation to the rest of the floor this room serves as a spatial hub and as a narrative focal point The player can go on a group of mini-adventures from here. So let's move to the adventure in the bottom right, the storeroom. This room serves as a transition room. It's pretty basic Its combat component is a phase spider. Its puzzle component is a trapped box. Its narrative component, this place is an ancient storeroom now overrun by giant spiders Its reward component, more consumables to make sure that the party doesn't have to continuously go back and restock. Alright, moving on, the library and the study. Deciding what qualifies as one encounter isn't an exact science so sometimes you just got to choose what provides you the most insight into the game's design. As a designer, I see these two rooms as one encounter as they're thematically similar, mechanically similar, and together they only have one combat encounter and one major reward. So what's the combat encounter? three greater doppelgangers. These creatures await the player in the study and because of the close quarters of the room, the encounter is designed to force the player to defeat them without the use of AOE spells. If the player has to attempt the fight several times they may also realize that you can hit this group with a spell from the hallway and lure them out to more advantageous ground. Now these are, by far, the hardest enemies the player has encountered since entering the tower itself, and they're specifically chosen Not only because doppelgangers play a large role in this tower story Which will create a neat little ""A ha!"" moment when the player realizes it, but also because they have a spell called Mirror Image which they cast immediately upon becoming visible. More than its mechanical effects on the encounter I believe this spell was chosen for its visual effect It makes each of the enemies shimmer with a half-dozen ethereal copies of themselves spreading out across the room. With three enemies all casting this spell in such close quarters, it sets up an intimidating ""whoa!"" moment for the player. As much as the designer in James would like to say that mechanical awesomeness is everything, It's important to also make sure to create encounters that look and feel impressive. And here, they've done just that without creating any new assets, mechanics, or code. The narrative component here, is mainly about the Doppelgangers casually hanging out in the study, something that will suddenly become relevant to the player further down in the dungeon But the player also finds a fair number of lorebooks on the bookshelves if that's what they're really looking for. Our puzzle component: Well, basically every bookcase in here is filled with traps But the real puzzle component is also the main reward component: the head of a mallet. If the player thoroughly explored the delving room, they found the mallet handle. Now they have to puzzle over how to put them together. And the reward? Well, the main reward here is the quest piece, the mallet head But the designers also use these rooms to provide mages with a few spells they may not have yet, like the Summon Monster spells, which are going to be very helpful in clearing this tower. Again, using the reward to ensure that the player has certain tools which will allow the designers to create challenges which require those tools later One thing to note here: When we're looking at combat encounters across the whole level, watch how they interact with the mechanics. In Baldur's Gate, the designers are building a game with a wide range classes And they don't entirely know what class characters the player is going to be bringing into the dungeon. So they have to make combat encounters which are interesting for each class Not every combat encounter is going to be perfect for every class, [but] over the course of the level there's got to be something for everyone. Here, they gave Magic users a few problems to solve with the spatial restriction on AOE casting, and if they were really clever, The opportunity to use ""Dispel Magic"" to make the fight easier, since the doppelgangers start the battle by casting two self-buffs. Rounding out this part of the adventure is simply a storeroom, and a forge to the north. This is a continuation of the preliminary part of the dungeon. Here there's no combat encounter, the reward is a small horde of ammo and consumables to round out what the designers need to give the player, and the puzzle component consists of a lot of traps. Oh, and there's also one more puzzle reward piece: with a tiny bit of thought the player will realize that they can take those mallet pieces they found and use the anvil here to reforge them, but what do they do with the mallet? Join us next time to find out. "
50,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,z06QR-tz1_o,"Every year, we get a lot of requests to do sponsored shows and we end up turning the vast majority of them down. But every once in a while, somebody approaches us and suggests something really interesting, like those Punic Wars episodes we did. It's usually something that, as soon as they pitch the idea, we all go, ""Wow, why didn't we think of that?"" Well, recently, the folks at Unity asked us to do a series on creating your first game. Frankly, I'm actually shocked we haven't addressed that before now, so time to fix that! The truth is, I have run into too many people who at some point decided that they wanted to make games. And they picked up an engine, and they started diving in and they quit before they ever finished their first game because the experience was just frustrating. It seemed like it was going nowhere. And I don't know if we can help, but this team has quite a lot of  collective game-making experience, so hopefully some of our advice here will help you avoid the common pitfalls. The first thing you're gonna wanna be careful about is scope. Many, many people pick up a game engine dreaming of making the types of games they play. Unfortunately, this often just is not possible. Games like God of War or Final Fantasy are made by teams of at least 40 people, sometimes way more than 40 people over the course of several years. Even if you're just amazing and you throw your whole life into creating your game, you're not gonna make a God of War or a Final Fantasy. Not even close, and especially not on your first attempt. Truth is, you're not even gonna create something like Super Mario Bros. as your first game. You *may* create like, 1 level's worth of Super Mari Bros. but even that's kinda pushing it. Your goal with your first game should be to get something built that you could actually play, even in the most rudimentary fashion, as soon as possible. Think of your first game as a learning exercise, not your master work. If you start with a huge project, you'll find that you don't even know where to begin and you'll get bogged down doing little bits and pieces that have no tangible result, and it will seem like you're not making any progress at all, and you'll hit roadblocks that you don't know how to overcome, simply to be left flailing for what to even work on next Trust me, Keep It Simple. If your first attempt at making a game turns out to be a one room platformer with bad collision  that you took three weeks to build, be proud of that, because you built it. You actually got it done. You made a game. That's more than most people ever manage. So play it, and show it to your friends and don't worry when they don't understand it or are critical because they're still thinking in terms of the big budget games they're used to playing. *You* know how much work went into making that game, and more importantly, you know that next time you'll be able to do it even better and faster. Soon, you'll be building games that people are asking you to let them play. Second thing to keep in mind, (and, I know that this is gonna sound weird but) don't go into your first game with a specific idea. Learn what you can do, and design around that. Don't lock yourself into an idea and beat your head against it for weeks or months. Instead, learn a few tricks watch a few tutorials, then start working towards something you're pretty sure you can build. It's okay if there are still a few parts of it you have no idea how to even start to do but make sure it's only a few parts when you're breaking your projects down and planning things out. Which, of course, brings us to tutorials. Any major engine has tons of people who happily make tutorials about pretty much everything. Go find them. Watch them. Study them. Then, if you're stuck or if you can't find an answer to your question, just ask. You'd be shocked at how many people are happy to help you through things if you just post on a forum or throw your thoughts onto the message boards. And don't be afraid of coding. Lots of people say that they can't code, but if you design your game right, you would be shocked at how little coding you actually have to do to get something done. It's a small enough amount that any of you out there watching this right now *can* handle it. Again, just start small, keep it simple. You'll learn as you go, and here especially there are plenty of sites out there that'll help get you started. StackExchange is a fantastic place to look if you have questions. Which leads us nicely into one of the big ones: Design your game around *your* skills. Part of understanding your scope is understanding your resources and, in this case, *you* are your resources. Are you a great artist but you've never coded in your life? In that case, have your game lean on your art skills while pushing you just enough on the code side that you learn some new things. Are you somebody who can't draw or model or animate? That's alright. There are plenty of games out there that get away with what you'd call minimum graphics. Accept that, and embrace it as part of your design. Constraints force us to be creative. And if there's something you really just *have* to have, if there's some coding task or some piece of art that you game just can't live without but you just don't have the chops to do it yourself, go to the asset store. There is an amazing amount of stuff that you can get there for next to nothing. James just talked to a professional studio that picked up their entire voice chat code from the asset store for less that it would've cost them all to go to the movies. James really wishes he had this sort of thing when he started out working in games. So take advantage of it. Finally, don't give up. There is a lot of life that's gonna get in the way. Most people start out doing this between juggling a job or a full school schedule and it's very, very easy to let days and then weeks pass before you get back to working on your game. It's gonna be a struggle at first, no question. I wish I had more comforting words for you, but all I can say is that most things worth doing are a struggle. and if you stick with it, maybe one day you'll have the option to make games *instead* of having to do all that other stuff. But that's it for the basics. I know that was all broad, basic stuff that most of you probably already knew but I think it is important to start there, because when you're deep in the process of making a game, it's often that real high level basic stuff that people forget. But, join us next episode for more of the practical nuts-and-bolts of making your first game. See you next week! "
51,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,zpp6spOs2EU," Over the last few months, I've seen a number of games hit Steam and just get panned, I mean, like, obliterated, for being short, For being finish-able in an evening or a weekend. So today, I would like to take a moment to defend shorter games, Even games that are a mere 2 or 3 hours long, Because by denying these games, we limit the variety of experiences games can offer. And by demanding that these games be longer, We may actually be demanding that they become worse. *Extra Credits intro music playing* Let me bring this into another context. Did any of us really want The Hobbit to be 3 films long? Was it made better by being stretched out into three lengthy parts? Did the added length of the overall experience increase your satisfaction Or your enjoyment in watching those films? Look, I love Tolkien and I love the Lord of the Rings movies, But The Hobbit as source material is a fundamentally different kind of story than the Lord of the Rings trilogy. And trying to turn it into the same kind of epic film trilogy that they've done before Weakened the resullting movie experience. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't equal to its predecessor. And personally? I would've gladly paid the same amount of money to watch one great Hobbit film That was just 2 and a half hours long. I am not exaggerating. If you told me I could get back the 7 hours I lost watching that trilogy, And instead paid the combined $30 entrance fee of all 3 of them, To see a single 2 hour Hobbit movie that was just amazing? I would happily pick that option. In fact, sometimes I feel like I should be paying less for longer experiences, If all they're gonna do is waste my time. This is exactly what we wrestle with in games. Very, very often, the number one complaint I hear from players is that If they're gonna pay $15 or $20 for a game, then that game should be a longer experience. But that logic suggests that an experience's value is equal to the number of hours it consumes, That video games are easily quantifiable products, Where there should be some dollar per hour formula that describes their worth. Even if we ignore that going to the movies often costs $12 for a 2 hour experience, Or that going to Disneyland costs, like $150 for maybe 8 hours, Which makes $15-20 for a 3 hour game Seem like a pretty reasonable price for entertainment in today's market. This reduction of a game's worth to hours played sets a troubling precedent. Because it assumes that all experiences can be stretched. That any experiences which is good for 4 hours would be just as good or better at 14 hours. And that is definitely not true. But more than that, it assumes that the developer is able to make a 14 hour experience Which is just as good and satisfying as the 4 hour experience they presented. On the exact same budget. Truth is, most games are built on a pretty fixed budget, And it's not like a lot of these developers delivering shorter games Are working with a lot of resources to spare. It's also not like most of them could raise a lot more money for their development budget By saying to somebody, ""Hey we wanna add 10 hours to the game!"" Especially if they're having to sell investors on the idea of adding 10 hours to a game Without increasing its retail price. Besides, these types of shorter games also allow a whole other audience to experience our medium. There are plenty of people out there who are working multiple jobs, Who simply don't have time to enjoy a 40 hour epic. But they do eagerly look forward to the next great 5 hour game. Why rob that audience of the experiences they most enjoy, By berating these developers for making short games? What's more, not only are these developers impacted by negative reviews, But they also have to contend with people watching let's plays of their game, and then not buying them, Or returning them on Steam, Because it's possible to finish the game inside the window of time Steam allows for returns. I might sound crazy saying this, But maybe we should go a step further than not down-voting short games simply because they're short. Maybe we should go a step further than not returning a game, Just because we beat it fast enought that Steam allows us to get our money back. Maybe, not every time, but just once in a while, If you watch a let's play of a game and just the second-hand experience of it moved you or made your day, Maybe, sometimes, buy the game anyway. Even though you've seen the whole thing. And if you do, send the developer a note telling them about it. Because I guarantee you, Amidst all that sea of criticism they're probably getting for having made a short game, Your acknowledgement that their game had an impact on you, And that you wanted to support it out of appreciation, regardless of length, Will make their day. Because, as players and developers, that's what we all want. And, yes, while I totally understand the desire to have more of our favorite experiences too, Unfortunately, not all experiences can be stretched, Without breaking what makes them so great. And, even more unfortunately, very, very few experiences can realistically be stretched On the type of constraints developers work under. And, ultimately, since we only get so many truly great experiences each year, Let's at least try to support developers when they deliver them. With the hope that in the future, they'll be able to deliver even more next time. See you next week! *outro music plays* "
52,Gaming,20,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,zsC37YyPHd0,"At a recent convention, James and his friends were talking about a type of game that we don't really have a proper term for yet. But given the fact that they have their own special forms of design and marketing and longer-term development, we could really use one. Let's go with ""Lifestyle Games"". Also, by the way, this is Josh. He's doing the guest art today, so say hello. Sometimes, a game is more than just a game - it's a lifestyle. You play it more than any other game. Your social life revolves around it. You study it, you talk about it with your friends, you watch other people play it on Twitch. You make friends over this game and you find yourself spending less time with the friends who don't play it. Your humor involves a lot of jokes about the game and your daydreams often wander to it. League of legends, World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, Overwatch and even Madden often fall into this category and there is nothing wrong with that -  within reason. There are plenty of people who make a lifestyle out of the sort of thing in a healthy and positive way. It can give people a social circle that they might not otherwise have had and give them something to always think about and look forward to. But it's hard to have a good design conversation around games like these when we've never really had the terminology to help us conceptualize all of these games fitting into one basket. Usually when we talk about Dota or Warcraft or Call of Duty, we talk about them as a MOBA, an MMORPG, and an FPS. We talk about how they relate to their genres rather than talking about what they have in common with each other. So we haven't really talked enough about how to make them better, both at being Lifestyle Games and at being so in a humane and positive way. But if we're going to do that, the first question we have to ask is: Can you intentionally design a game to be a Lifestyle Game? Is that something that just sort of happens with a large enough fanbase and a lot of luck? Or are there common elements that these games share which allow them to become Lifestyle Games? Well, yes, both, kind of - I don't think you can make something that's a hundred percent guaranteed to achieve Lifestyle Game status, but I do think that there are common design elements which make it a lot more likely. But, before we dive into these, a quick side bar Not everybody is going to experience Lifestyle Games as a Lifestyle. Any Lifestyle Game is going to have plenty of people who play these games for maybe a few hours every couple of weeks Also, for almost any game you can probably find a small number of people who experience it as a lifestyle even though it may seem unlikely to do so. When I talk about Lifestyle games here, I'm talking not about absolutes, but simply about games that a significant amount of people end up experiencing as a Lifestyle. So with that caveat what elements seem to improve the likelihood that a game becomes a Lifestyle Game Well it has to have robust social interaction, because we're social creatures, and even the most introverted of us once at least the potential opportunity to share something as meaningful to them as a lifestyle pursuit with other people. Next it needs functionally infinite content. If it doesn't have that, it cannot become a Lifestyle, because people are just going to exhaust what's there and move on. Often this infinite content comes in the form of competition against other people, because the people you play against are a varied, interesting, and potentially inexhaustible well of content. But infinite content could also come in the form of procedural generation. Or with cases like World of Warcraft it could come in the form of a lot of things that take a lot of time to do, like acquiring all of the best raid loot when content takes that long to master, the devs have time to make more of it before any But the hardest core players have exhausted what's already there, which leads us to our next similarity between these games: they have to be regularly updated with new content, patches, and other supports to give players something to look forward to. Something for them to think about. Something to provide players with the implied promise that the game to which they have devoted so much of who they are won't just end or disappear on them. Of course, it will eventually end - no game is permanent - it just has to feel like all of that time and effort that players are investing isn't being wasted. And finally, any Lifestyle Game has to be deep enough to occupy the players thoughts outside the game, either mechanically or narratively, and that has to be supported by opportunities to do so. When the player can't be in the game itself, they need to be able to delve into reddit threads, or watch streamers or check out new builds, or pour over Wiki's, or turn on some eSports to watch the pros play. So those are the common elements - the features a game needs in order to become a Lifestyle. But now that we have this concept of a Lifestyle Game that we can design for and improve upon, we next have to ask ourselves: How can we make it good for the player? Healthy? I mean, I've played my share of Lifestyle Games that felt more like an obsession, where I put them down after a while and it felt like waking up from a stupor, where the last few weeks or months or years of my life just felt like a blur, like the game stole that time from me. But there have been others that I played where I made lifelong friends, and I came away feeling like ""Yeah that was a massive investment of time, but I got something valuable from that time. I formed relationships, I've learned something about myself, or about the world."" That first type of game, the obsession game, those usually involve a great deal of Skinner Boxing. We've done a whole episode on that topic before, but suffice it to say, Don't do that, please. I mean, as a designer, you're probably not going to be able to avoid putting *some* treadmills into a game that's meant to be played for a thousand hours, but if the game is *about* the treadmill - if there's no other reason to play it - then you've done something very wrong. But avoiding harmful design like that is the easy part. The harder question is: How do we actually put positive elements into these games? Well first you can include real-world skills as part of play. The simplest is stuff like leadership and teamwork. Allowing people to practice those for thousands of hours as part of their lifestyle pursuit is a powerful thing and I'm sure that many of you have stories of how you learned to work in a team or learned to be a better leader through play Many Lifestyle Games also get the player to practice math, whether it's the advanced math that sometimes goes into figuring out what equipment you should use, or simply forcing the player to get really good at doing quick arithmetic in their head, these are skills that stick with people long after the game itself has been put away. And there's all kinds of meaningful experiences that you can build into the world and the lore of your Lifestyle Game. If your game is suited for it, there can even be opportunities for a bit of tangential learning about history or mythology. Finally, let your game help people build friendships. Have your company organize events, like Friday Night Magic, or build in tools that allow players to stay in touch and hang out, even when they're not looking to be super hardcore about your game. Give them moments of triumph to celebrate not as individuals, but together. And don't be embarrassed when your game gives them something to laugh about. So, whether it be Magic the Gathering or Street Fighter or League or Dota, Lifestyle Games come in all flavors. And yes, they may come from different genres: CCG, fighting game, MOBA, or MMO, but those labels don't adequately describe the experience that these games are providing. So it's time we start thinking about how we can design better, more compelling versions of these games which lives will, for some time, revolve around. We can get even better at making these whether it be on the practical side, by making these experiences better at being Lifestyle experiences, or on the moral side, by Skinner Boxing less and giving players something to take with them when they finally put the game down. We can do better. See you next time! "
53,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,-VI5zDQJoN8,"This is Casablanca, in Morocco, as the US War department mapped it in 1942. They noted everything from the cement works to the hippodrome. This was Casablanca’s Casablanca. “Across the Mediterranean to Oran, then by train or auto to Casablanca in French Morocco.” But there was an area missing from the movie screen, just beneath the Southern border of this map. This is Bousbir, a walled off sex district in Morocco. It was famous. People sent postcards. It had an official medical dispensary and a police station. Practically speaking, prostitutes were prisoners within these walls. On December 10, 1942, American troops opened Bousbir’s gates. As customers. What happened in the next three days in Bousbir is an encapsulation of the surprising ways the American military, and many militaries around the world, fought venereal disease in World War II. “You’ve got gonorrhea, Baker.” “Gonorrhea, why I don’t know how…” “I do. You had a dirty woman.” Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis, also known as venereal diseases, or VD, were a significant problem in America at the time. World War II raised the rates and the stakes. Rates varied widely by geographic region, rank, and service branch. But for example, this chart shows a distribution in the US Air Force in Continental Europe. In October 1944, 120 out of 1000 servicemen had VD. That meant lost days on the battlefield. In August 1944, when the US Seventh Army was liberating France in “Operation Dragoon,” about 1 in 10 of the men had VD. “The Army recognizes the risks present with a large number of men and the satisfaction of their sexual impulse.” How did the United States fight STDs in the military, while dealing with the stakes and scale of a World War? How did their tactics complement — and clash with — today’s values? And where do the bunny rabbits come in? “The greatest risk...is that...of venereal...diseases.” “If you’re smart, you’ll keep away from prostitutes and pickups. Most of them have syphilis or gonorrhea. They’re not safe — and they can’t be made safe.” Long before this advice during World War II, VD was a problem in the military. This War Department chart estimated VD rates in the US Army - that peak is actually during the Civil War. But the Great War — World War I — started a new era of global war and mass compulsory service. A military draft greatly expanded the pool of soldiers, making education and propaganda techniques necessary. This poster was typical. Pamphlets complemented the message. The United States Public Health Service wanted men, the primary audience, to avoid “prostitutes or chippies.” But if they did have sex, it provided instructions for combating disease. Women were given similar instructions — abstain if possible, but if they did “have intercourse with any man except your husband, make him wear a rubber.” Starting in 1914, the American Social Hygiene association formed to boost VD awareness, producing pamphlets and even creating exhibits like this. The army also made it clear that managing VD was part of the war effort. The most famous example was General John Pershing’s General Order No. 77, which ordered commanders to attend to venereal infections by running small clinics, or prophylaxis stations, dedicated to VD, making “no half-hearted efforts.” Congress joined the VD fray as well with serious laws focused on areas near training camps. The government shut down red light districts, often clustered near training camps, and quarantined tens of thousands of women. “Birds-eye view of a typical rapid treatment center in a Southern state, located in a former CCC camp, as are many of these hospitals. Here, infected women are treated with new intensive therapies for syphilis and gonorrhea.” This created clinics that would last through the 1930s, like this mobile one. Just before World War II, America was having a national conversation about the VD problem outside of the military as well, with the Surgeon General writing a book about it. The book encouraged regular tests for syphilis. So once World War II began, all of these strategies would be in play again, and they’d need to be used in a global war. “It is extremely important that you do not go on a drinking party and allow yourself to become so drunk that you get careless. Drunkenness is responsible for much venereal disease.” Movies like Sex Hygiene were compulsory viewing. But focusing on propaganda overlooks that there were multiple strategies which the military employed. The war on VD focused on prevention, treatment, and control, and these efforts interacted in occasionally contradictory ways. As early as 1926, the government began cutting soldiers’ pay if they missed work due to VD. That was paired with Sex Hygiene, the film and pamphlet, which included info on “wet dreams,” “masturbation (self-abuse),” and “sex relations.” That was matched with advice that sex “should be kept for marriage” with eventual entreaties to use prophylaxis. Often, this was a condom: “Test it carefully. Inflate it with air as you would a toy balloon until the rubber is fully extended.” The army also distributed medicine to soldiers. “Another good way not to get VD is to use the army’s new pro kit. It consists of a tube of ointment, a silk cloth, a piece of tissue, and some instructions.” This was the paradox in military propaganda - prostitutes were clearly labeled as disease carriers, but recommendations to get a prophylactic, or “pro kit“ held equal emphasis. The government also acted aggressively to curb prostitution. The May Act gave the Federal government the right to bust brothels if local areas couldn’t. It was used near American military bases, like at Fort Bragg. The Surgeon General also established Venereal Control Officers that year, with duties largely falling to medical officers. Policing extended to soldiers, too. Influenced by charts like these, which appeared in surgeon general Thomas Parran’s book, syphilis tracking operations formed in more stable locations. This 1945 Army medical history includes a typical questionnaire administered to soldiers in the Carolinas who had contracted VD. The goal of questions about the time of sex contact and location of the “pickup” was to track houses of prostitution. This post-war Navy interviewer’s aid, showing techniques used during the war, provided similar guidance: a private interview room; education about the VD chain; and forms with checkboxes for place of encounter — bus; dance hall; park —and procurement — bellhop; waiter; pimp. This resulted in VD detective cases — if a prostitute were tracked to a pick-up spot like the “Green Lantern Cafe” after an interview, the case was sent to a public health worker who sent out a field worker to pull in the prostitute or disease carrier for a medical inspection. This procedure was easier in American controlled areas or during relative peacetime. It happened in England during World War II, with the installation of prophylaxis stations around the country. In further flung locations, this was more difficult, and warnings had to suffice, like this one in Iran, which cautioned soldiers to think of their mother, wife, or sweetheart before going out. So did all of these videos and pamphlets and posters and laws actually work? It’s complicated. In Oran, Algeria, the United States military selected the top European brothels. Brothels were set aside by the military- and then segregated. -- 9 for white troops and 2 brothels for black troops, both with their own prophylaxis stations. Military police were stationed inside the brothels between 5 and 9 pm. As early as 1940, the War Department had to send letters to commanding officers to clarify that they did not condone prostitution. But in far flung war-torn countries, that line blurred. This brothel in Manila had a sign for the nearest Prophylaxis station posted on the door. Italy was typical of more destitute countries with rampant solicitation and prostitution. In Naples, prostitution led to large VD treatment centers like this one, well-maintained prophylaxis stations and US army supervised civilian examinations. Towns were officially placed off limits when possible. The military did not ignore wartime realities — and in 1944 Congress agreed to stop penalizing soldiers’ pay if they had VD, with the hope of encouraging reporting. But for all that work, the biggest weapon might have come from these. “Industrial monument to the miracle drug. Mass production penicillin plant in Terre Haute, Indiana. Each batch is tested for purity, New Zealand white rabbits serving as subject. Upon how they react depends whether the drug can safely be used for battle casualties with pneumonia, meningitis, gas gangrene, and other wound infections. They seem to enjoy their job of serving mankind.” This chart shows the effects of the drug - even as total VD rose, the introduction of penicillin as a primary treatment reduced days lost. Due to military experiments, penicillin treatment gained its own complicated legacy. But in the context of the military, the drug became a weapon against venereal disease, and it went from military use to the public at large. Here’s President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Casablanca in 1943. This is the footage we expect from World War II. Leaders and marching. But just as war is filled with reversals and contradictions, so are the social projects that surround it. There are other forgotten victims and private injuries. Extras that are missing from the credits. FDR didn’t risk running into troops leaving Bousbir. By the time he visited, it was closed to Americans. The official report reads: “Disturbances arising among the troops in the walled city were responsible for this action. The walled city and all other brothels in Casablanca remained off limits from 13 December 1942 throughout the occupation.” What happened between Dec 10 when the troops went inside those walls and Dec 13th when the brothels closed to Americans in Bousbir, in Casablanca? There’s a gap in the record. Even today. Thank you so much for watching that video. If you’re interested in the research that went into it, Vox actually has a new membership program with lots of extra features. For that program, I have recorded an additional video in which I go into some of the research and all the crazy stories I couldn’t fit into the video that you just saw. I’m gonna share one piece of trivia with everybody though, which is that that movie — Sex Hygiene — that you saw? It was actually directed by the legendary director John Ford, the same person who directed “The Searchers.” "
54,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,-W6v2_0evUU,"TIME magazine named ""The Silence Breakers"" Person of the Year for 2017. These are the women and men who shared their stories of assault, harassment and hostility and publicly named their alleged abusers in Hollywood, the media, and politics. But if you look closer, there's something else on the cover. A hint that there are many more who don’t — or can’t — break that silence. So while 2017 was a landmark year for talking about sexual assault, harassment, and rape, a majority of the women and men who’ve felt violated don’t speak out at all. For every 1,000 rapes, it's estimated that only 310 are reported — that's just under one third. In fact, it's believed that rape is the most underreported crime. Of those reported, only a fraction lead to arrest. And only a fraction of those arrests lead to prosecution. And only a fraction of those prosecuted are incarcerated. And, when it comes to harassment, Well, a U.S. government report found that when men and women were sexually harassed at work, the least common response was to formally report it. Only 30% of people did. That means that for every three that reported, another 7 remained silent. Another study cited in that EEOC report found that of the people who reported harassment at work, 75% faced some sort of retaliation for doing so. Which explains why so few people report their harassment: Fear. In fact, fear is the number one reason people don’t report. Fear of retaliation for speaking out. And this is why the Silence Breakers are a big deal. 2017 certainly feels like a year in which many, many, more people are speaking up in spite of that fear. But there’s just so much more we don’t know. Even the statistics cited in this video — by their own admission — overrepresent the experiences of straight white women, and probably don’t accurately reflect the experiences of women of color, men, lesbians, gays, or transgender people. Which is to say that the stories of the few silence breakers that have come forward are really just the tip of the elbow for all the people remaining silent. "
55,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,0oJ6cYyr1bQ,"In the last half of 2015, around 500 people in states ranging from California to Massachusetts had two things in common: They all ate at Chipotle, and they all had severe diarrhea. Every year there are hundreds of food poisoning outbreaks in the US, but it’s unusual for one company to see six outbreaks, from three different germs, in just six months. “In 22 years of doing these kinds of cases, I can’t think of a chain that has ever had that happen.” Obviously, not ideal for a company whose brand is serving higher-quality food. “If you’re like other Americans, you love to eat Chipotle, but you hate all those terrible blood stains in your underwear.” To understand how Chipotle plans to fix it, you have to look at the different ways the food was contaminated. For the two large outbreaks in Boston and Simi Valley, California, the pathogen was norovirus. “I just vomited for many hours straight.” Norovirus doesn’t come from the food supply itself, but rather from a restaurant employee who was sick but came to work anyway. The two locations spreading norovirus were closed and sanitized, and Chipotle says it will strengthen employee training. An outbreak at 22 Chipotle locations in Minnesota involved Salmonella bacteria, which did come from the food itself. “State health officials now are blaming tomatoes” Chipotle then switched to a different tomato supplier. But the E. coli outbreak has been tougher to nail down, in part because cases popped up in nine different states. And then: “There is more trouble for Chipotle.” The CDC later announced more E. coli cases from Kansas and Oklahoma, which may or may not be related to the previous outbreak. The types of E. coli that make humans sick live in the intestines of cattle. So people can often get infected from undercooked beef. But fruits and vegetables exposed to contaminated water or manure can also transmit the bacteria. So here’s what’s a little unnerving for Chipotle customers. “The CEO said that they have tested every single one of the 64 ingredients that Chipotle uses, and they still can’t find the problem.” Unfortunately, in multistate cases, the CDC can identify the specific source of the food poisoning only about half the time. And it’s particularly challenging with the type of food Chipotle serves. “Almost everything that is in a burrito is in a taco is in a taco bowl. So it’s hard to parse out and say, 'Oh it was the cilantro, oh it was the lettuce.'"" In the meantime, Chipotle hired an expert to devise a wide-scale food safety plan. It includes routine DNA testing of ingredients before they’re shipped to restaurants. “The testing protocols that he sets up on the supply-chain are pretty rigorous. So assuming you can get the supply chain to go along with you, I think that’s going to be a really positive thing, and especially if they want to do fresh items in their stores.” There can be a tradeoff between safe food and fresh food, as Chipotle seems to be acknowledging. Instead of shredding cheese and chopping tomatoes, lettuce, and cilantro inside the restaurants, they’ll now be processed and packaged off-site in centralized kitchens. Chipotle’s stock has been dropping, but it’s worth remembering that other chains have weathered much worse. In 1993, E. coli from undercooked hamburgers at Jack in the Box sickened 700 people and killed 4 children. “They brought in a vice president in charge of food safety who had carte blanche to turn the company around from a food safety perspective. I think that’s something that Chipotle really needs to think pretty hard about doing.” After the Jack in the Box outbreak was over, they launched a marketing campaign to signal the corporate overhaul. “I’m ready to make Jack in the Box better than ever.” The message wasn’t subtle. "
56,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,13XU4fMlN3w," When we talk about gender equality in the US there’s this one statistic you see all the time: ""Women earn 79 cents for every dollar men make."" And while that statistic is factually correct, there’s a lot it doesn’t tell you. It simply compares the median wages of men and women who work full time. It doesn’t tell you how the wage gap plays out for women with different educational levels or different ages, or who work in different fields. And you need that information if you want to start closing the gap. Part of the wage gap reflects the fact that women are more concentrated in lower-paying occupations. But to fully understand the issue, you  have to look within occupations too. Back in 2009, three economists set out to understand the wage gap by following a group of MBA graduates from the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business. They looked at thousands of men and women who graduated between 1990 and 2006. And their data showed that men had slightly higher salaries right out of the gate. One year out of business school, women were making an average salary of $115,000 while men earned $130,000. But nine years out of business school, things looked really different. Men were earning an average salary of $400,000, while women were earning 60 percent less —$250,000 on average. The gap had widened considerably. But research suggests the gap doesn’t stay that wide — that it shrinks as women enter middle age. This chart shows how the wage gap for college graduates changes as women age. The lower the line, the bigger the wage gap between men and women. If you look at women born in 1973, you can see the wage gap growing as they go from their mid-twenties to their mid thirties. Better than previous generations but heading in the same direction. Same thing for women born in 1968. The pay difference for men and women continues to grow as they move from their mid-thirties to their mid-forties. And for women born in 1948, things started off the same. The gap widens as they get older. But then, all of a sudden, it starts shrinking. As working women approach their 50s and 60s, the difference between men’s and women’s salaries gets smaller Which makes sense if you think about what often happens during a woman’s 20s and 30s. In the Chicago MBA study, women with kids had a wage gap twice as large as women without. The truth is that women take on a disproportionate share of child-rearing tasks. A survey from Pew found that in 2-parent households, women did more than men when it came to managing kids’ schedules, taking care of them when they’re sick, and handling the majority of household chores. And that was a survey of families where both parents worked full-time. But these additional responsibilities seem to hurt some women more than others. This is a key research finding from Claudia Goldin, an economist at Harvard who is a leading researcher on the gender wage gap. She shows this by exploring how gender pay gaps vary in different fields. This is one of her charts. Each of these dots is a different higher-paying job. The lower the dot, the larger the gender pay gap. The further to the right, the more the job pays, based on the average income of men in that job. These green dots represent jobs in the tech sector. For the most part, the jobs are pretty close to the 0 line, meaning the difference in pay between men and women is fairly small. The same is true for jobs in science. The yellow dots. But look as these red dots. They represent jobs in business. And they’re mostly clustered toward the middle and the bottom of the chart, meaning they have some of the largest wage gaps. There’s a fairly simple way to explain some of these differences—some jobs require specific hours. Others are more flexible. Take your prototypical businesswoman. Maybe she’s a venture capitalist, maybe she’s an accountant. Either way, she has a standard 9-5 schedule so she can meet with other businesspeople or with clients. If she’s not available to her clients when they need her, her bosses won’t think she’s doing a good job. Compare that to a scientist who works in a lab. Most of her work is self-directed. It doesn't’ really matter when she runs her experiments, as long as she gets them done. If she gets her work done, her bosses think she’s doing a good job. For the millions of women in with jobs that demand very specific hours, the wage gap is larger than it is for women in jobs with more flexible hours There’s one job where we can see this really clearly. In 1970s, women pharmacists earned about 66 percent of what men did. Pharmacies used to be mostly independent businesses where a single pharmacist might be responsible for keeping his shop open whenever people needed it. Today, most pharmacies are owned by large chains. They stay open longer, which means they need more pharmacists. Women pharmacists now have a lot more options and a 6am to 2pm shift is just as good as a 9 - 5 shift. Nobody gets rewarded for working exceptionally long hours. And the wage gap for pharmacists has shrunk dramatically. Today, female pharmacists make 92 percent of what their male counterparts do. Of course, we can’t all be pharmacists. There will always be jobs where it’s important to  work particular hours. But there are lots of jobs where hours could potentially become more flexible than they are right now. And research tells us the more we can make that work, the more the wage gap is going to shrink. "

But each one represents something unique. So let’s try to understand them. Let’s start big. The ocean is the large saltwater body that covers most of the Earth. Technically, it’s the whole thing, but we often split it into five parts with five different names. Sea can mean the same thing as ocean, though it’s more specifically used for a large inland body of saltwater, like the Caspian Sea. A bay is a part of an ocean bounded by land on three sides. A cove is one too, but it usually has a smaller entrance, often in a mountain. Make a bay bigger, and it’s a gulf. While a bight is a slighter and smaller indentation. A fjord is like a bay with a steep entrance, often consisting of mountains. In Scotland and England, you might hear about a firth. It’s like a fjord, but can be a broader term for bays as well. A sound is like a large bay, but often longer and between two sections of land. Sometimes, people call it a channel or strait if it connects 2 larger bodies of water. Sometimes, a channel is a bit wider. Heard of a lagoon? It’s a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water. A barachois is a coastal lagoon and it's split from the ocean by a sand bar. You’ll hear that word a lot in Eastern Canada. It fills up at high tide. A tidal pool shows up at low tide. A delta is where a river flows into an ocean or lake, or into an estuary, which is separate from the ocean. It may be where saltwater and freshwater mix. But water isn’t all about the ocean. Let’s go inland. A lake is usually freshwater contained in land. But there are a few types. Loch is a Scottish word for lake, but it’s also an inlet that can connect to the ocean— that’s what Loch Ness is (no comment on the monster). A pond is a particularly small lake. While a mere is a notably shallow one. Think of a big puddle. A tarn is determined by its location — you’ll find it on a mountain, usually in a spot that has been carved out by a glacier. A kettle lake is similar, but it forms when a melting glacier’s water shapes a mountain. An Oxbow lakes is special too. It comes from a river that changed course and left a lake behind. In Australia, it’s called a billabong. Can we get a kangaroo? OK, fine. A lake is fed by a tributary, which is a kind of river - water that flows from high ground to low. A creek is a small stream. There are lots of other names for it, like kill, rivulet, beck, or ghyll. A branch of a river used to even be called a sprain. An arroyo is a Spanish word for a creek that fills in after a heavy rain, and it’s commonly used in the American Southwest. It’s called a wadi in Arabic. Elsewhere it might be called a wash. A freshet has a few definitions, but usually it fills with water after a heavy snow. A spring shows up when groundwater flows to the surface. Sometimes, a lee is a natural spring flowing under the earth. A geyser is a spring that boils and occasionally bursts up. The word’s name can be traced back to “geysa,” meaning “to gush.” And in the desert, coming from groundwater as well, you'll find an oasis — a green and fertile patch that comes from an isolated lake. And no, there are no monsters there. These are just some of the many amazing bodies of water in our world. Now that you know the names, the next step is easy. Start exploring them. So just in case you doubted the true epicness of my journey in a rented kayak down the Potomac River, these bodies of water are connected. In the Potomac they have found bull sharks that have actually swum in from other bodies of water. "
58,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,14VYnFhBKcY,"We make a lot of charts at Vox.com. And, of course, charts have axes. And pretty much every time we make a chart with a y-axis that starts anywhere other than 0, someone winds up emailing to complain. You see, there's a very famous book called ‘How to Lie With Statistics’ and it contains a discussion of how you can create a misleading chart by messing with the y-axis. And it’s definitely true that you can do this. Here's a chart from Fox News, for example. It's a total disaster.. But the y-axis dogmatists take it way too far. The big problem with people who lie with statistics is that they are trying to lie to you. It’s true that misleading charts are one way to lie. But the English language is also a tool that can be used for lying, and that doesn’t mean we should never speak English. Sometimes you need to fiddle with the y-axis to tell a story properly. Right now, for example, the share of American adults who have a job has fallen to a generation-long low. This is a really big deal. But if you chart this data with a y-axis at 0, you can’t see the change at all. Narrowing the range to dramatize what we’re talking about isn’t “lying” with statistics. It’s emphasizing what’s relevant. The way Edward Tufte puts it is you need to “use a baseline that shows the data, not the zero point.” After all, 0 is just a number like any other. Sometimes to make sense of the data, you need to be able to show numbers that go below 0. Halting at 0 in those cases just doesn't make any sense. But extending every chart way below 0 would be crazy, too. And of course where 0 even is depends on the units you are using. If you do a chart of a person’s temperature in Fahrenheit, you’re likely to miss the fever if you’re zoomed all the way out to 0. But if you redo it as a Celsius chart, it’s not quite as bad. But if you switch to Kelvin and extend everything to Absolute Zero then your charts become useless. When people are really lying with charts, the main thing they’re normally doing wrong is leaving out the context, not leaving out the 0. Now back to that Fox News chart. You would never know from this chart that the top marginal rate was 39.6 percent back in the Clinton administration. Or that in the first half of the Reagan administration it was 50. Or that back when Eisenhower was president, it was 91. The missing 0 was really the last of that chart’s problems. They left out the entire history of taxes in the United States. So just remember, y-axes don’t lie to people. People do. "
59,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,1TV6JFxMEcI,"and... Alexa, what’s the weather today? with clear skies and sun. Today’s forecast has partly sunny weather with a high of 77°F and a low of 61°F. UHHHH… I still don’t understand the use of Fahrenheit. Virtually every country on earth uses Celsius to measure temperature. But the US still uses Fahrenheit. And for that reason, we —at Vox— often get comments like these. *Okay, we get it.* Besides the fact that the majority of the world uses it— the metric system makes conversions a lot easier. The Celsius scale even looks simpler. It has freezing and boiling points at nice, round numbers— zero and 100. Where in Fahrenheit, it’s a bit of a mess. And of course, this isn’t just an issue of aesthetics or weather updates. America’s unwillingness to switch over to the metric system has had serious consequences. In 1999, a 125 million dollar satellite sent to Mars, disappeared in the Martian atmosphere. It’s a setback to years of work already done in the vastness of space— all it takes is one navigation error. And this colossal mistake was largely due to a conversion error between US and metric measurements. Fahrenheit was really useful n the early 18th century. At the time, no one really had a consistent way to measure temperature. But then a German scientist, came up with the Fahrenheit scale when he invented the mercury thermometer in 1714. To make the scale, the most popular theory is that he picked the temperature of an ice/water/salt mixture at the zero mark. He then put the freezing point of water, which is higher than a salt mixture, at 32. And placed the average temperature of the human body at 96. From there, he placed the boiling point of water at 212 degrees. In 1724, Fahrenheit formalized that scale and was inducted into the British Royal Society, where his system was a big hit. As Britain conquered huge parts of the globe in the 18th and 19th centuries, it brought the Fahrenheit system and other Imperial measurements, such as feet and ounces along with them. And Fahrenheit became a standard system for the British Empire across the globe. In the meantime, the metric system was gaining popularity during the French Revolution. It was put in place to unify the country at the national level. So by the second half of the 20th century, Celsius became popular in many parts of the world, when many English-speaking countries began using the metric system. Even America attempted to switch over. The change would have been good for trade and scientific communications with the rest of the world. So, Congress passed a law, the 1975 Metric Conversion Act— Which led to the United States Metric Board that would educate people about the system. This created the only metric highway sign in the US— the Interstate 19 connecting Arizona to Mexico. But it didn’t go much further than that. The problem was that unlike the UK, Canada or Australia, the law made the switch voluntary instead of mandatory. And of course people resisted the change, and the Metric Board couldn't enforce the conversion. So, President Reagan ended up disbanding the board in 1982. The next nudge to metricate came when the metric system became the preferred measure for American trade and commerce in 1988. But nothing really stuck with the general public... ...Even though bizarre measurements like Feet and Fahrenheit are not doing them any favors. Students have to train for two sets of measurements, making science education even more difficult. And companies spend extra dollars producing two sets of products, one for the US and the other for metric. There’s also an argument for public health. According to the CDC, about 3 to 4000 kids are brought to the ER due to unintentional medication overdose, every year. And conversion errors for dosage are to blame. So it seems like a no brainer— America needs to switch to the metric system to match the rest of the world. But it is still struggling to make that change. That’s because it’ll take a lot of time and money but there’s no financial proof that this will all be worth it. So unless that change is proven to be economically better… We’re not going to be using celsius anytime soon. What’s 77°F in Celsius? 77°F is 25°C. Ah! Okay. "
60,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,2-MLV_RJ6KQ,"It ranges from elaborate murals ... to crude scribbles on bathroom walls. Leaving your name, or “tag,” on things that aren’t yours is an age-old practice in bragging rights – just to say, “I was here.” And the more intricate the tag or more challenging the spot, the better. But, this story isn’t about the type of tag you’ve probably seen. It’s about this one. The tag of the hobo. “Hobos,” or “tramps,” were workers and wanderers that once roamed the countryside by illegally hopping freight trains. Peak Hobodom in America began in the 1890s, continued through the 1930s, and usually coincided with periods of financial crisis and mass unemployment. Around the same time, the expansion of the railroad opened up new work opportunities in the West. This kind of classic late 19th century hobo was someone who kind of navigated between jobs and not having jobs. You know, a lot of these jobs are temporary, like seasonal agricultural work, or you know, “Thanks for building the bridge, now get out of here.” I’m Bill Daniel, I’m a photographer – I work in film, photo, and tall tales. By 1911, the number of hobos in America was estimated at 700,000. Being on the road wasn’t easy. Hobos were unwelcome in many towns and were constantly chased by both local police and private railroad police. And despite their reputation for being bums, 100 years ago, a skilled hobo was called a “professional,” or, “profesh.” So a profesh is someone who’s, like, good at what they do, they’re able to not get caught by the law, and you know, leave the camp clean for the next guy. And maybe most importantly, they didn’t draw attention to wherever hobos were. A profesh, you know, does not blow up the spot. Hobos were constantly on the move, but they found a way to communicate with each other — through graffiti. Search “hobo graffiti” online, and you’ll find these mysterious icons that hobos supposedly used as a sort of coded graphic language. Symbols that they would scratch or draw onto houses and fence posts to let fellow wanderers know things like “kind lady lives here,” “there are thieves about,” or “good place for a handout.” Stories surrounding these signs have been circulating for a long time. Tramps have a sort of touch-and-go code. This sign, for instance, means “no good.” They show up in the original hobo literature, too. Like in the books of Leon Ray Livingston, also known as A-No. 1, once the world’s most famous hobo. In the early 20th century, A-No. 1 published several books about hobo life and lore, and included symbols like these. And news articles at the time even claim to decode the “secret hobo language.” This St. Louis Star article from 1921 even includes illustrations of how the signs were supposedly being used. The problem is, all this information came from hobos, a group that took pride in their elusiveness and embellished storytelling. The truth is, there really isn’t any evidence that these signs were as widely used as the literature suggests. It’s hard for us to know what the facts were because I think hobos used their mythology as kind of a cover. And so the tall tales, and the drawings, and even the books by A-No. 1 were ways to project an image of themselves that both kind of, like, blew them up, but also kind of kept them hidden. Hobo graffiti was actually rooted in a graphic representation of their road persona, called a “moniker.” Any hobo has a moniker that rides the rails. And different monikers fit different ’bos. Monikers usually said something about the person. Where they were from. A physical trait. If they were young or old. How hobos used their monikers sort of falls into two camps: leaving their tag on boxcars moving across the country, and something Bill calls “tramp writing.” Early original tramp writing has to do with addressing the issues of mobility and travel – announcing your place and direction and where you are. The original graffiti included arrows and letters indicating which direction that hobo was heading next. Sort of like a hobo tracker. Tramps are generally making these marks on water tanks or stationary things, you know, where they were camped out. So it worked as kind of a personal telegraph. You know, like, “I’m here, is anybody around?” Tinder for tramps. And it wasn’t long before the drawings moved from stationary objects like water tanks to railcars. I think there was just an evolution, kind of like what happened in New York, with, like, “Oh I can write on my street corner, but if I write on this train, boom it’s going everywhere.” And hobos weren’t the only ones doing this kind of graffiti. Rail workers, stuck in the same trainyard for years, marked passing boxcars with monikers of their own. I started doing it October of ‘68. A lot of them guys would go on vacation, and they’d say, “Well I seen one of your damn drawings in Canada, or Mexico, or California, you know? I thought well, I’ll never get there, might as well send something. Monikers aren’t used for communication anymore, but they do still exist in freight graffiti. And it’s kind of come to mean specifically this type of drawing. You know, usually oil stick or chalk-based drawing that’s usually an identity proclamation, usually a sketch, a lot of times a self portrait. “Moniker” just kind of is the perfect word to describe this type of art writing. At its core, all graffiti is a messaging system, even if the message is as simple as “I was here.” Tramp writing, you know, tramp marking, has that in common with graffiti that it has a little bit to do with making a connection with somebody in a really remote place, even when they’re not there. Just this ability to say, like, “Whoa, you got here too.” "
61,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,2GbkvEvWaQs,"This is Timmy. He’s Six, and he lives with his parents and little sister in a town between Washington, DC and Baltimore. ""He insisted on a trash themed 5th birthday party. We decorated the whole house with recycling He's into Angry Birds and monsters. He's drawing, he's writing. He's reading really well. Timmy was born 7 weeks before his due date. He was only 3 pounds 9 ounces. He spent the first five months of his life in the NeoNatal Intensive Care Unit (or NICU). Timmy has a rare genetic condition which requires him, among other things, to breath through a tube in his throat and get most of his food through a tube in his abdomen. Every room in Timmy’s home doubles as a medical supply stations for his daily medical needs. But when you’re around him, it’s impossible to avoid Timmy’s amazing energy -- a 6 year old bursting with vivid imagination, fixated on trucks, legos, and building binoculars out of toilet paper rolls. Timmy’s mom Michelle is showing us the medical bills from that NICU period. Timmy’s been put under anesthesia 42 times, and between all the surgeries, medicine and intensive care, the bills added up quickly Michelle: “773,000 dollars by the time he was 2.5 months old. We figure by 3, or 3.5 months we hit a million.” Like many insurance plans, Timmy’s policy had a clause which caps how much the insurance company will pay over his lifetime, cutting him off once he hits a certain dollar amount. This is called a lifetime maximum. Timmy’s lifetime maximum was one million dollars which he hit within just a few months of being in the NICU. According to his policy, after he hit a million dollars of care, he would be on his own. But something happened just six days before Timmy was born that would dramatically affect him and his parent’s lives. ""The patient protection and affordable care act goes into affect today"" ""The new healthcare reform bill kicks in today."" ""Health insurers can no longer impose lifetime limits or discriminate against kids with preexisting conditions. ""The issue of lifetime limits: that is not going to be the law any more after tomorrow. "" The Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, is best known for requiring insurers to cover people with preexisting conditions and letting kids stay on their parents’ insurance til age 26. But one of the lesser-known parts of the law is that it banned insurers from putting a cap on how much care they will pay for over a year or over a lifetime. This came right in time for Timmy’s family. “He would have lost his insurance at a million dollars which would have been about half way thru the NICU stay. I think we have $4000 dollars in savings right then which would have covered less than a day of care in the NICU and I don’t know what would have happened. See, we’ve only experienced life post Obamacare. Before Obamacare, 60% of all bankruptcies in the US filings were tied to medical bills. And it was the sickest patients with complicated blood infections and heart conditions who were losing their insurance due to lifetime limits. These are the patients who needed insurance the most. When the family moved to Maryland they intentionally looked for a new insurance company so that they could start from zero in case lifetime limits came back. But even on this new plan they are getting close to a million dollars. “As of this morning, it’s at 985,147.19. That’s for the current insurance plan we are on now which started when he was 8 months old” You're not eight yet. How old are you? Six I said 8 months. Do you know how old 8 months is? It's when you were a little baby. You couldn't even walk. As of now Timmy and his parents are safe from a lifetime limit to his benefits. But 20 miles away, congressional republicans and President Donald Trump are working on dismantling the law that got rid of lifetime limits and saved Timmy’s health coverage Republican replacement plans are split between staying with unlimited coverage and reimposing the lifetime limit. A late February draft of a Republican bill would keep the ban on lifetime limits — which would be good news for Timmy. But legislators say this is far from the final version, and likely to change significantly But overall, the lifetime maximum issue is not a huge part of the debate, which mostly focuses on things like “pre existing conditions. And allowing folks to stay on their parent's insurance until the age of 26 But for Timmy’s parents who have a good employer provided health insurance plan, the lifetime limit issue is the only thing that matters in this debate. That's the only thing we think about. I mean more so than the preexisting thing. Actually when you said the other day when we were talking you were like ""Oh the lifetime maximums dont get covered enough"" I was like ""really?"" Bedtime in the Morrison home looks similar to bedtime in many homes with story books and stuffed animals. But things are more complicated. Once a week, Timmy’s parents replace his throat tube. This is one of many steps that is Timmy’s family goes through to keep him healthy. But Timmy and his family have a routine to manage all of his care. It consists of lot of medical supplies, equipment, help from nurses and doctor’s visits. This routine has been enabled by the fact that the Morrisons don’t have to worry about Timmy’s insurance going away once they hit a million dollars. But this dependable routine in under threat as the healthcare debate may result in lifetime limits coming back. If that happens, Timmy could lose his insurance and this predictable if complicated routine will be turned upside down. You know we're not trying to say that it's not our responsibility to be paying for his care. I mean that's our responsibility. It's just that the reason you have insurance is that's so far above what's possible. So I guess I don't want to come across as saying that I want someone to swoop in and pay for everything. That's not what I'm saying. But we want it to be manageable. Something that we have some hope of paying. "
62,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,2PEt5RdNHNw,"This is me. And these are some of my co-workers. Tonight, we're on an epic adventure, defending a village from an army of dog monsters and trying not to get ourselves killed. Welcome to the magical world of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, the best game I've ever played. Chapter 1: What the f*ck is D&amp;D? D&amp;D is a tabletop role-playing fantasy game. You and your friends sit around a table and pretend to be heroes going on an epic adventure together. This is a role-playing game. It takes place entirely in our collective imagination. Every D&amp;D game is run by a DM -- Dungeon Master. You arrive at a small village on the outskirts of the forest. The villagers watch you nervously as you enter. They seem tired, worried. The DM is the main storyteller in D&amp;D. They create and describe the adventure the heroes go on, giving them goals to accomplish and rewards to motivate them. The mayor of this town wants someone to investigate strange sounds coming from a nearby abandoned mine. He's offering a thousand gold pieces to anyone brave enough to take the job. And while it might look like the heroes and DM are playing against each other, they're actually playing with each other. The goal of D&amp;D isn't to kill the other players. There's actually no winning in D&amp;D. The goal is to hang out with your friends and act like weirdos together. So the DM's job is to create an adventure that's exciting, fun, and challenging, and the heroes' job is to work together to survive those challenges and explore the world the DM has created. Which brings me to my favorite part of D&amp;D. Chapter 2: Creating A Hero. Before you can start adventuring in D&amp;D, you need to create your very own hero. Using the D&amp;D handbook, you pick a race: human, elf, dwarf, etc. And you pick a class, basically your job: fighter, wizard, rogue. I play Amelia human warlock. Oneshoe, rock gnome sorcerer. I play Isla, druid elf. Harriet, tiefling rogue. Blaze, dragonborn paladin. Once you've decided what you want to be, you fill out one of these bad boys, a character sheet, which is just a piece of paper that keeps track of your strengths and weaknesses. Stuff like that. That character sheet is important, but way more important is what makes your hero unique. Deciding what your hero looks like: she has a septum piercing, violet eyes. She looks like a devil, like a fun devil. Think about Predator. Think Predator in your mind. How they dress: big sorcerer floppy hat on. A rotting werewolf pelt. She doesn't wear a lot of clothing. And whatever little quirks make them stand out: I hand out pamphlets like a Jehovah's Witness. I carry a warhammer that's as big as my body. I have a demonic imp who follows me around. And what's her name? Mother Teresa. You also create a motivation for your hero, something that calls them to adventure. It can be as lofty as rooting out evil doers or as simple as getting treasure. Once you've decided who you'll be, the DM weaves your stories together and you start playing. You pass through the dark entryway of the abandoned mine. The passageway is narrow. Suddenly you see a dark figure in the corner. And you keep playing for a long, long time. Playing D&amp;D. I know it seems really complicated, and this thickass rulebook doesn't help. But, at its core, all of D&amp;D is just three steps: describe, decide, roll. The DM describes what's happening: in the corner of the mineshaft you find a sleeping goblin. He's lying down on a pile of coins. He doesn't seem to have noticed you. What do you do? The heroes decide what they want to do: I want to steal the coins. Excellent. And then the player rolls one of these: a 20-sided dice. Is it dice or die? I don't know. Singular of dice. Historically, dice is the plural of die. Die is singular, you're right. I'm going to try it again from earlier on. And then, the player rolls one of these, a 20-sided die, to find out if they succeeded or failed. The higher you roll, the better. I rolled a 2. Not good. While sneaking, you knock over a pile of rocks and the goblin shoots up wide awake. Then, the cycle starts over. The goblin grabs his club, looks at you and yells ""INTRUDER!"" What do you do? That's D&amp;D in a nutshell. And it's that second step, ""decide,"" that makes the game so special. In most games, how you play is limited by the options the game designers give you. Run this direction. Fight this thing. Save this princess. Essentially being railroaded down a story that someone else wrote for you. In D&amp;D, what you do is totally up to you. Maybe you panic and try to run away. Maybe you draw your weapon and prepare to fight. Or maybe you try to trick the goblin. Okay, I look at the goblin and I say ""we come in peace, as friends!"" 17? The goblin lowers his club, raises his eyebrow, and says ""friends?"" The DM sets the stage, but once the game starts, no one person controls where the story goes. Session after session, the DM builds an adventure that reflects the heroes choices. That goblin you tricked last week might tell you about a dragon's lair nearby. That dragon's lair may contain a valuable treasure you can steal. And stealing that treasure might attract the attention of an evil wizard who wants to use it for his own schemes. As the game goes on, the decisions you make will shape the world you play in. We won a karaoke competition. Closed a rift to the Nine Hells. We were slaughtering this band of peasants. It was a total, like, misunderstanding. D&amp;D doesn't just give you the freedom to choose, it asks you to own those choices. Before long you might find yourself thinking less like you and more like the hero you're trying to be. Roleplaying. All of us are roleplayers. We go through our lives playing different parts for the people around us. Some we get to choose. Video producer. Podcaster. Co-worker. Some, we have no control over. Black. Female. Queer. Even with our friends, we can fall into patterns of behavior that eventually become expectations. The wisecracker. The cool girl. The shy one. Roles we're so used to playing we don't even think of them as roles anymore. They're just us. D&amp;D gives you permission to be something different. To surprise yourself. And that can be really scary. When you do something in D&amp;D, We come in peace! you're trusting everyone at the table to take you seriously. And you're trusting the other players to have your back. I pull a flower out of my hair, hand it to him and give him a wink. I produce tiny rainbow over Harriet's head? Mother Teresa does her best goblin impression and says ""it's cool, they're with me."" 16. 18. Natural 20. The goblin looks at you more relaxed and says ""FRIENDS!"" That shared vulnerability is what makes D&amp;D different from any other game you play with your friends. We can spend our whole lives wandering alone through the corridors of our minds. D&amp;D asks you to wander together. To believe, for just a few hours, that there is more to us than what meets the eye. More silliness. More warmth. More bravery. And yeah, just a little more magic. Should you play D&amp;D? D&amp;D is ridiculous. But when I ask my friends why they play D&amp;D, they don't talk about the monsters or the dungeons. They talk about how the game makes them feel. It just feels so freeing. I'm not thinking about, you know, I have to do this tomorrow or I need to take care of this at home. It just kind of, like, brings your inner child back out. Nobody makes fun of anybody. Nobody feels self-conscious about it. The older that you get, the more expectations people have of you. D&amp;D, there aren't any expectations. I can just be free. I feel like the rest of the world doesn't matter, like, I'm always super stoked to play. It's like a fun, really creative way to connect with each other. It's made us really grow closer. The way that you look at the people you were just playing with is really different than other people in the real world because you've engaged in something so collaborative and imagined together. The point of D&amp;D is obviously, like, adventures and ""oh we're world-building together!"" But the real point of D&amp;D is, like, you're in this bubble with these people and you're entirely focused on each other and remembering all the reasons that you like spending time with their characters but also spending time with them as human beings. If you look past the wizards, past the dungeons and magical creatures, D&amp;D is a game about the people you play with. A game where everyone agrees to bring their weirdness and creativity to the table. Byrd, not now. To help build a world that belongs to all of you. A world shaped by your triumphs, your defeats, your personality quirks, and your stupid inside jokes. A world that could not have existed if you and your friends hadn't sat down at a table one day and said ""let's play."" Believe it or not, this video is not sponsored by D&amp;D. We're just huge nerds. But if you're interested in playing, you should check out the D&amp;D starter set. It comes with a premade campaign, character sheets, a mini rulebook, and dice.

63,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,371CRxnGkA8,"This is a 1993 Chevy Suburban. And this is a 2018 Chevy Suburban. The 1993 one cost $21,000 brand new and 2018 one costs $47,000. But if we adjust the price for inflation, the 1993 Suburban would cost $42,000 today. Even though the 2018 model comes with modern features like a back up camera, remote engine start, and ya know - airbags - the cost hasn’t changed much in 25 years. It’s not just the Suburban — the average price of new cars has risen only 7% since the early '90s. While the price for almost all other goods has increased by 86%. And that, is thanks to NAFTA. “The nations of North America are ready.” “Strengthened by the explosion of growth and trade” “To recognize that there is no turning back from the world of today and tomorrow.” When the North American Free Trade Agreement took effect in 1994, it was the first major trade deal of its kind. The US, Canada and Mexico agreed to eliminate tariffs, which are taxes on most imported and exported goods. The countries hoped it would increase investments and that by strengthening Mexico’s economy, it would slow illegal immigration. The trade agreement benefited the auto industry in particular. It allowed automakers to keep costs down, because cars and auto parts could be traded for free. Well, for the most part. If at least 62.5% of a car’s parts were sourced from North America, it would be tariff-free. Cars that didn’t meet the requirement, or were made overseas, would be slapped with a 2.5% tariff. NAFTA also gave automakers the ability to source cars where costs were lowest. By comparison, a car made in Mexico costs $1,200 less than one built in the US because labor and the parts are cheaper. “As an industry, we’ve kind of performed some economic miracles when it comes to keeping cars affordable by being able to source some of those 30,000 parts from, you know, the least expensive places.” Let’s take this model of a 2014 Ford Mustang for example. It’s engine was built in the U.S., but it’s manual transmission came from Mexico. It's impossible for a consumer to easily find out where each individual part came from, but it’s likely the doors were molded in Canada. The speedometer came from Germany or China, which was assembled in the US, but then sent to Canada to be installed into the dashboard. The seatbelts did come from a company in Japan. But the seats were probably made in Mexico. The tires most likely came from South Korea. In the end, the 2014 Mustang was built in Detroit, but with only 65% of its total parts sourced from North America. It made the tariff cut. And Ford is in no way the only company who does this. About three-quarters of the cars sold in the US meet the standards to avoid tariffs, including most cars produced by the top four auto brands. The US is actually producing more cars now than before NAFTA. Same for Mexico and Canada. But you wouldn’t know that if you listened to politicians. “NAFTA was a mistake.” “The single worst trade deal ever made, by any country, anywhere in the world.” “Instead of creating jobs, NAFTA cost us jobs.” In the auto industry alone, a third of US auto manufacturing jobs have disappeared since NAFTA was signed. As the same types of jobs have grown in Mexico. But in reality, that may have less to do with NAFTA, and more to do with automation. Researchers have found that fewer than 5% of US jobs lost from sizable layoffs can be blamed on trade with Mexico. But the timing of these manufacturing layoffs, in lots of different industries, made it easy to point the finger at NAFTA. So while most Americans think the trade deal was good for the US, those that feel they were directly affected are passionately against it. And this opposition is why President Trump is following through on a campaign promise. “A brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA called USMCA. It sort of, just works. MCA.” But this isn’t a much of a new deal. While it’s essentially a re-branding of NAFTA, it does make one major change to the auto industry. Because it would require cars be made with 75% North American sourced parts. And that 40-45% of those parts must be made by workers who earn at least $16 an hour. At least 46 and as many as 125 cars sold today, that aren't taxed under NAFTA, wouldn’t qualify under the proposed USMCA regulations. Our 2014 Mustang likely wouldn’t meet the new requirements. So if it is implemented, auto manufacturers will have to decide to just pay the 2.5% tariff or change how they manufacture their cars sold in North America, even if it increases production costs. ""What looks small on paper, when you  think about the complexity and how many parts are on every car, it starts getting out of hand fast.” Prices of those cars could go up anywhere from $470 to $2,200 dollars in the US. And at these higher prices, roughly 60,000 to 150,000 fewers cars would be sold in the US each year. That would mean job losses. “I don’t want to see our companies leave and fire our workers. Those days are over.” But the USMCA could actually incentivize car companies to leave North America. NAFTA made US car companies more competitive with the global market, and even attracted foreign car companies to build in North America. And if those cars are going to face higher costs of manufacturing and tariffs - their production might get moved to China or other countries. Building a car with thousands of parts is an incredibly complicated process. So while NAFTA has kept cars pretty cheap to produce, the USMCA could change that. And consumers will likely be the ones to pay the price. "

Lisa: ""It can't just be a bad day. I feel like I'm getting dumber by the minute."" Her brother and her father and her uncles have it, so she must have it, right? Grandpa: ""That's right, then the Simpson's gene kicks in!"" But she finds out, there’s a catch ""The defective Simpson's gene is on the Y chromosome, so only men are affected"" And it got me thinking, what do we actually really know about the Y chromsome. And how did we get there? ""What does the ""Y"" stand for?"" There were a lot of fascinating TV shows about genetics in the 1950s ""We are about to unfold for you an adventure in the world of science"" They taught us that nearly every person has 23 pairs of Y chromosomes ""In every male human being, the 23rd pair of chromosomes is a mismatch"" ""One type has a long X chromosome. The other type has a short Y chromosome"" Early on we learned that most girls have two x chromosomes and most boys have an X and a Y And then this happened A man with XYY was discovered He was a normal guy living a normal life A few years later some researchers started drawing lines between having an extra Y chromosome and a life of violent crime. ""Some studies from the 70s said that a man with an extra Y chromosome meant a man was more aggressive"" It all started at a scottish mental institution where 315 men were genetically tested for chromosomal abnormalities. 9 of these men were above average height, had severe mental impairments, had criminal records, and had XYY chromosomes. Although these 9 men had criminal backgrounds almost identical to men without XYY. Scientist concluded that their history was directly related to their genetic disorder. ""So he has an extra Y chromosome, that's the criminal gene"" Then, Mary Telfer, a researcher in the U.S. began searching for the XYY chromosome in developmentally disabled boys in institutions in Pennsylvania. They were tall and had moderate acne on their face and in her mind these were clear signs of XYY. ""Kilhurst research center says he's an XYY man. Do you believe in that theory?"" Around that time a tall man in Chicago with visible acne scars on his face brutally raped and murdered 8 nurses. His name was Richard Speck. It immediately made sense to Telfer that he was XYY. The New York Times latched onto this story and ran a series about the genetic disorder stating that Speck’s criminal disposition was directly related to the fact that he was a “supermale” with an extra Y chromosome. Genetic testing however, concluded that he was XY. But the damage was done. The idea of a genetic mutant supermale quickly became a cultural phenomenon. ""Well they've found I've got this, um, extra male chromosome"" Not surprisingly there was this huge bias in the research conducted on XYY men. Nearly all genetic testing of these chromosomes were conducted in prisons and mental institutions. ""Wait, so the extra Y chromosome doesn't lead to violence"" The fact is, about 1 in 1000 men have XYY syndrome and a vast majority are completely unaware of their condition. There’s just no proven correlation between aggressive criminal behavior and having an extra Y chromosome. ""The extra Y means nothing at all"" Most people know that there’s not a murder gene in our bodies that make us criminals, but we still use the Y chromosome as a huge cultural symbol for aggression and masculinity. ""Pick up a Y chromosome while you were there, you might be short one"" A lack of a Y chromosome means a guy is super feminine and an extra Y chromosome means he’s a killer. And then there’s Jenna Maroney. ""Jenna is an Ashkenazi Jew with an extra Y chromosome?"" ""What's that now?"" When you’re watching your favorite TV show, it’s important to remember that masculinity and femininity are as much defined by the world around us, as the genes inside us. "
66,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,7hYkUGd2CWo,"You probably know what this tastes like, or this, or even this. It tastes as good as it smells, every time. But there are about 10 to 15 million people in the US with taste and smell disorders, and for them, these might not taste exactly like they're supposed to. People say it feels like eating air. Eating a steak might feel like chewing salty leather, M&amp;Ms might feel like crunchy rocks, tofu —&nbsp;well tofu might taste the same. But point being, there are a lot of people out there who don't experience flavors normally. ""There's a hidden epidemic of this problem in the United States, and even in the world."" Issues like this happen for so many different reasons that it's hard to pinpoint one cause. And you might think, you know, whatever, it's just taste. This is the kind of thing that movies joke about. ""I think I lost my sense of smell."" ""You gone smell blind, son."" But taste and smell disorders can cause some serious problems. People almost always stop eating normally: they either overeat because they eventually hope to feel satisfied, or they undereat because nothing satisfies them. And because they can't taste or smell, they run the risk of consuming a lot of things they shouldn't: rotten food, spoiled milk, or even harmful smoke and gas. ""I had something in a toaster oven. My then-husband walked in the house and went 'you have a fire!' He unplugged it. I didn't smell anything, unless I had turned around I wouldn't have seen it."" Fortunately there are rehabilitation programs that can help cure this. There's no official universally accepted treatment as of right now, and sometimes the fix is only temporary. But when it does work, it can be a huge lifestyle change. And that is a pretty sweet deal. "
67,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,7kZ47paxVp0,"If you’re living in a house where your wastewater runs into your yard, that means you’re at a higher risk for diseases like cholera, e. Coli, for diarrhea. These are diseases we typically associate with developing country settings, and not with the wealthiest country in the world. So the waste just comes out of your house and into your backyard. And are you worried about your kids and your grandmas playing in it? B: Yes I am. Concordia is a place where infants die at 3 times the rate the healthiest county in a rich state like Maryland. It’s a place where nearly half of the children live in poverty. Nearly half the population is obese. ¼ of the people never finished high school. There aren't a lot of job opportunities, and unemployment is higher than the national average. We know a lack of education and poverty drives down health outcomes, and for this and other reasons, Concordia has become one of the sickest counties in America. So we wanted to go down to Concordia and really understand why do places like this in central Louisiana, why are they always at the bottom of these health rankings? Why are they struggling so much with their health? What I did hear again and again was that people really felt forgotten and left behind by Washington. They felt like their needs weren’t being addressed, that their problems weren’t being looked at by anyone. We can’t get any help from anyone. I went to State rep, I went to the health department. Went to the Congressman. No help. There were no biological reasons why people here were less healthy than in any other counties, but there were clear political failures that made them sick. If you compare Concordia to the U. S. overall, the people there are doing worse on pretty much any health measure or health indicator you can think of. The people in Concordia have gone through long periods without clean drinking water, and they had to have water tanks shipped in by the National Guard, and go to these water tanks every day so their kids wouldn’t be sickened by what was coming out of the tap. Barbara and her neighbors, they've gone to the mayor of Ferriday, and they've gone to the mayors of neighboring towns. They’ve asked local lawmakers for help, they asked the health department for help getting their sewage system fixed, and they say no one will help them. They keep hearing that local health officials don't have the money, they don't have the budgets to fix the problem. You don’t typically think people are living without the basic fundamental requirements for healthy living with the wealthiest country on the planet. Over the last three years between 2008 and 2016 Louisiana had this Republican governor Bobby Jindal. Jindal really believed that in order to grow the economy in Louisiana he had to cut down on government. So he slashed about 30,000 jobs in the state's work force. He dismantled and privatized the charity hospital system, which was set up to care for the poor. He nearly halved the staff at the Department of Children &amp; Family Services. He refused the funding Obamacare gave to states to expand Medicaid which would give more people health insurance. Governors are hurting and they don't want a Medicaid expansion that they're seeing in these House and Senate bills. They really need more funding, especially Louisiana. Jindal’s successor, John Bel Edwards, on the second day in office, signed an executive order that would expand Medicaid finally and give more people health insurance. More than 300,000 people have signed up in Louisiana. So if Obamacare is repealed, all these people who just got health insurance are gonna be in limbo again. In Louisiana, I met the medical director for central Louisiana. He oversees public health for Concordia and some of the other counties with really poor health outcomes. So much funding for public health comes from federal sources that if there's really a change in direction and a desire to ratchet back federal participation, it will affect maternal and child care, reproductive health, nutrition... When you look at state health rankings, they are like this for Louisiana. And if you were in the ICU you would say was a flat line. I mean you would say the patient is dead. In his ten years on the job, his staff has been whittled down almost in half. And that meant firing the health providers who see patients who can't afford health care. To fill in the gap, Holcombe stepped outside of his role as medical director, and he's now seeing up to 100 patients a month. This is an enormously difficult problem. Because the black / white disparities of this are enormous. And for HIV aids, it's also like the prison population. 3/4 of the people are African American in a state that has 33% percent African Americans. One of the really startling things about Concordia and these other counties with very poor health outcomes is that they're all dotted along the Mississippi River and on the other side you have these grand antebellum plantation homes just a short drive from Concordia. I think a lot of the political attention has been focused on places like West Virginia, PA, OH, the rust belt, where people are seeing their economic prospects dry up and they’ve been really affected by trade and changes in technology and globalization. But in that conversation, communities like Concordia have been completely lost. These are the places that have been arguably struggling for a much longer time, with more complicated, systemic difficult problems. And they didn’t get a shred of attention in this election campaign. Well, you see large residual African American populations that have more or less been left behind. So they've been left behind economically, they’ve been left behind educationally. They have low socioeconomic status and that's your triangle that determines health. So you have lots of people in little triangles, little incomes, little education, and low social status. We did see a state government that dismantled the safety net, put in policies that benefitted the rich and hurt the poor, and we’re looking at a republican federal government that his campaign now promises to do something very similar. If Donald Trump and the republican party make good on their promises, we might see more communities that have their own version of what happened in Concordia, when it comes to public health. "
68,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,8p5n0TbRFEk,"There's a common question that people might ask: Is the world better off if Donald Trump stayed off Twitter? I actually think what I would just rather see is Donald Trump not be mean on Twitter. I really worried when Donald Trump started using Twitter as a way to be demeaning and degrading, and he would call people out, he would attack people's character. And that to me was very frustrating, when I watched candidate Trump take his rhetoric from the campaign trail, use Twitter to elevate that kind of toxin into our American dialogue. And now he's president of the United States, and I do worry about foreign policy done by Twitter. Not because it couldn't be a strategic use of larger-scale messaging. I mean, Donald Trump seems to have followers all over the globe. I just worry about him using that platform in a way that could be shooting from the hip, that could be dangerous. Could undermine even his aspirations for peace in communities, or for solving international conflicts. So the great thing about Twitter is it's this platform that's neutral, but it's a powerful platform, in the same way that radio became powerful in politics. On a Sunday night a week after my inauguration, I used the radio to tell you about the banking crisis and about the measures we were taking to meet it. In the same way that TV, suddenly in the Kennedy-Nixon debates, became a powerful platform. The candidates need no introduction. The Republican candidate, Vice President Richard M. Nixon, and the Democratic candidate, Senator John F. Kennedy. Well now technology, innovation, has brought us to a new level of social media. Since I've been in Newark politics, I've noticed that a lot of people pick on cities in America. And so I get kind of tired of that, and a long time ago I began to respond to people who had big platforms, who were attacking our city. My first person was Conan O'Brien, who, on his show, attacked us. The mayor of Newark, New Jersey, wants to set up a citywide program to improve Newark residents’ health. That’s good. If the health care program would consist of a bus ticket out of Newark. It wasn't even on social media, but I responded with social media Last week Conan O’Brien took a swing at our city. And before you knew it, this Cory-and-Conan kerfuffle, this fight we kept going back and forth on social media and on his show, that it ended up getting millions and millions of people tuning in to a fight where I was getting a chance to brag about Newark. You failed to understand that city is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Northeast. I’m officially putting you on the Newark, New Jersey, airport no-fly list. Try JFK, buddy. Eventually I went on The Tonight Show With Conan O'Brien. The two buried the hatchet in their tongue-in-cheek standoff. O’Brien called it the most expensive joke ever told, making a $100,000 donation to Mayor Booker’s Newark Now charity. And so my point is that I've learned that social media can be a great platform. That when you encounter people who are trolling cities, that you can do something about it. So whether it's Conan O'Brien, Mindy Kaling, Cory Booker? I can’t believe he came. I guess anything to get out of Newark. I think that when you defend your city, but defend it with kindness, and defend it with humor, or defend it with generosity of spirit, you actually can turn people around, or at least get them to profess the truth. That America is great, and America's great because we have great communities everywhere, including in places like Newark. Look, I don't wanna throw advice at President Donald Trump. I mean, clearly he must think to himself, ""I don't need Cory Booker's advice; look how well I'm doing. I'm president of the United States."" But I do think that Donald Trump would shock the world if he shifted and just said, ""You know what? I'm going to live kindness on the internet.” Our president should always be calling us to be a nation that we actually all wanna be, a nation that is indivisible, a nation that works for liberty and justice for all. And to do that we must all evidence patriotism, which is love of country. And to love your country, you got to love your fellow countrymen and countrywomen. And so, Donald Trump, stay on Twitter, but just elevate the conversation. Be a uniting force, not a dividing force. Be an elevating force, not a degrading force. "

Storms will develop during the mid afternoon hours and will move from west to east. Highs will reach the low to mid 90s.] Savannah Bowens: It puts me on edge. You know what I’m saying? Because I could be walking to the store. Walking down the street. Getting in my car. And it seems as just because I'm trans that I'm murdered. Savannah Bowens is a black trans woman living in a city where three black trans women have been murdered this year. Savannah: How many are even unaccounted for? I believe that number is so much bigger. [news clips: “Tragedy for the transgender community.” “ A transgender woman was found dead.” “The second killing of a transgender woman in Jacksonville.” “Celine Walker was killed inside this Extended Stay America.” “Another transgender woman found dead.” “This victim is the third trans woman who’s died by gun violence in Jacksonville this year.”] None of the murders in Jacksonville have been solved yet. And they’re actually a part of an alarming crisis. Since 2015, at least 85 trans women have been murdered across the country -- most of them black trans women and gender non-conforming people. Savannah: It’s like, if I was searching for a place to move to like where do I go? Where would I be safe? Turns out a lot of these cases have something in common... [news clips: “She was a transgender woman police identified as a male when she was killed.” “In just the past 90 minutes, Jacksonville police have released that victim’s birth name.” “Who was identified initially as a man by the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.” “JSO is referring to the victim as a black male in his 20s who appears to identify as a female.” The way cops are investigating these crimes...could be delaying justice. Transgender people are more likely to face violence and discrimination than the average U.S. resident. One of the reasons they’re often at risk is their IDs - a simple document that many might take for granted. When the gender marker on state-issued ID doesn’t match the outward appearance of a transgender person, it opens up a world of harassment, and sometimes violence. Savannah: When it comes to getting a job. You know this could be the best job ever. And then now all of a sudden they see my gender marker and now they're treating me differently. They can be afraid to show their IDs while driving, at a bar, or to vote, for fear of someone finding out that they’re transgender. Savannah: The scary part is for me, being stopped by the police. You just never know who's stopping you. You don't know if these people are homophobic. You just don’t know. [Savannah at church: “Even in my unworthiness he calls me friend. Aren’t you glad this morning that God doesn’t look at your circumstance or look at your issues."" Singing: “You are everything to me.” According to a 2015 survey of transgender people, nearly a third of people with mismatched IDs reported being harassed, denied services or attacked. They can also lose access to medical care, become homeless, or be forced into sex work. Savannah: A lot of times our trans women they're resorting to things such as prostitution because society has made it so hard. Every girl may not be as feminine or look passable as we love to say in our community. What do you do when you're hungry? What do you do when your rent is due and your lights are about to be cut off, but you can't get work because you don't fit into the norm. Because your friends? They're in the same situation as you and your family wants nothing to do with you. So you walk the streets in unsafe environments just so that you can feed yourself. The discrimination trans people face in life can continue after they die. In Jacksonville, during murder investigations, the police often identified victims by names they no longer used, instead of their preferred names. In the trans community -- whether this happens in life or death -- it’s called deadnaming. The police have also systematically denied the victim’s identities by incorrectly describing their gender. Savannah: If they were known as a woman and that's who they lived their life as, they're refusing to do that. In addition to the disrespect - deadnaming can slow down a murder investigation in its most critical hours. Savannah: You don't get to choose what gender I am. Those people that knew me in the streets or wherever, they knew me as a woman. So you're saying, oh a man. You're misnaming me and giving my biological name, how do you expect to solve a case, if nobody knows that. What if I was murdered in a hotel and people saw a woman go in and then you're saying a man, that's not what they saw. That's not that's not who they are. This is part of a national pattern. ProPublica contacted all law enforcement agencies in locations where trans people have been killed since 2015, and found that 87 percent of victims were deadnamed or misgendered by authorities. Many police departments cite an internal policy to go with the name and sex listed on a victim’s state ID. Savannah: I need my gender marker to reflect what it is. So that I can be respected. I feel like it's a prison. It’s a prison and I have a release date. But I have no keys to get out of my cell. Savannah has recently started the process of legally changing the gender marker on her ID. But turns out, switching that tiny “M” or “F” can be incredibly hard. There are no federal policies to address gender marker changes on documents like driver’s licenses. So it’s left up to the states. Some are generally more trans-friendly than others. While others require a court order, an amended birth certificate, or proof of surgery. Trystlynn Barber: The laws are so convoluted across the United States, state to state. And it does not make any sense. Supposed to be united right? Trystlynn Barber lives in Georgia and has been in the process of changing her ID. But it’s not been easy. Georgia law requires proof of gender reassignment surgery, which is a high barrier for most people. Trystlynn: The cost of gender reassignment surgery at the low end that I've seen in research in the United States is 15,000 dollars. The problem is getting health coverage to cover something like that. To be hit with a solid wall of not being able to move forward is heartbreaking. It can destroy people. But she later remembered a crucial detail. Trystlynn: I wasn't born here. I was born in New York. The State of New York, with a less restrictive policy, required only a doctor's note stating she was transitioning. They sent her a corrected birth certificate within a month - which she’s used to update most of her documents. Trystlynn: There it is. That's a certified copy grey seal. With my name. My changed name and my correct sex. And I was half way back from the mailbox. When I open this up. I had other mail in my hands, everything else fell from my hands I fell to my knees. I started crying, in the middle of the grass right out here. I’m sorry. After thinking that I was not going to be able to ever get it done. Was the most amazing feeling. I'm sorry. As for Savannah...she’s working with a lawyer in Jacksonville to get her ID changed. Savannah: When that day comes for me when my gender marker is changed, it will be like the missing piece to my puzzle. It's that important. She hopes it will keep her a little bit safer...but knows this problem is bigger than a letter on her ID. After we saw her, another trans woman was murdered in Florida, this time a few hours south of Jacksonville. The Sheriff's Office described the victim as a man “wearing a wig” and “dressed as a female.” Another case of deadnaming… and a murder that’s yet to be solved. "
71,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,9QcVNahOavw,"Most people think it’s patriotic gibberish when they hear the most well-known version of Yankee Doodle Dandy: “Yankee Doodle went to town a-riding on a pony stuck a feather in his cap and called it macaroni.” We’ve all wondered why this guy is naming his hat feathers after pasta. But what most people don’t realize is that Yankee Doodle Dandy was originally a British song making fun of American doodles — that’s a word for simpletons. And the macaroni wasn’t lunch. This was a macaroni. Macaroni was a catchall term in England for the scenesters of the time, who sat between the Restoration Era fop and the dandy on the historical timeline of trendy looks. They were called macaronis because when they left England (usually on mommy and daddy’s dime), they toured Europe and brought back this totally amazing new pasta they discovered in Italy. It was … yep, macaroni. So macaroni became the nickname for the pretentious elites of the 18th century and their fancy style. Macaronis didn’t have Mac Book Pros. But calling them hipsters of the time isn’t far off the mark. The sad part is that the Americans wanted to be just like them. Americans like to think of themselves blazing their own path. But they still had a desire to import customs of elite society from England. That included fashion, and yes, they even thought macaroni was cutting edge cuisine. That’s the joke in Yankee Doodle Dandy — not that they were naming a feather, but that they thought a lame feather in their hat made them high society macaronis, which nobody should want to be in the first place. During early Revolutionary War battles, the British used the song to mock Americans, but Americans embraced a chance to throw it back at them. So when the British surrendered at Yorktown, the Marquis de Lafayette taunted them by playing Yankee Doodle as they walked away, and that secured its place as an unlikely anthem. So you’re right to imagine something patriotic when you hear Yankee Doodle. Just make sure you imagine this when you hear macaroni. Some of these macaroni loving Americans like Thomas Jefferson were eating macaroni and cheese. We know from a Reverend who ate with Jefferson what his recipe was. We know from these papers that he did dine at the President's. And there he had a pie called macaroni, which he thought was made of onions or shallots, but somebody explained to him that it was in fact an Italian dish. And he still didn't like it that much. "
72,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,9e2IfMf4KhI,"Alvin: So when you get your dog, and you’re like 11 years old… they never tell you what to expect down the road. The only thing that they tell you is... ""You have to clean after your dog."" This is Alvin and his dog Rainbow. They spent 18 years together since Alvin was just 11, and last year... My dog was dying, and I couldn’t work. When a dog's dying… it really does feels like a human is dying and there’s a reason for that. Keep going! Come here! When I graduated college, my parents went away to work abroad and so when Rainbow was 10 years old, she came to live with me in New York. Everytime my dog got sick or every time I had to go home at 6 o’clock to feed my dog— I was a 22 year old, I didn’t really know how to do that. But eventually we kind of figured out how to talk to each other. We figured out what each other needed. Even as she was losing her vision, and her hearing, and her continence… there still was that communication. Dogs are the most popular pet in the US — more than one in three households have one. And if you’re among them, you can probably relate to this non-verbal communication that Alvin’s talking about. The relationship dates back tens of thousands of years, when wolves and humans became companions. Scientists disagree about whether it was wolves or humans that initiated the relationship, but both stood to benefit. One anthropologist, Pat Shipman, believes a hunting alliance between wolf-dogs and people helps explain why humans survived while Neanderthals died out. Shipman: I think our relationship with animals has really been fundamental to our survival. And by starting this cooperative arrangement with wolves or wolf-dogs, we began laying the foundation for relationship we have with animals, we have domesticated today. But the idea of non-working, dependent animals is fairly new. The word “pet” was first used in the early 1500s to describe spoiled children or “any person indulged or treated as a favorite.” Then by the mid-sixteenth century, the word took on animals as well, specifically orphan lambs that needed to be raised by hand. These days, 86% of adult pet-owners in the US say that they consider their pets part of their family. According to historian Katherine Grier, the reason we began caring for animals is ""... connected to changing ideas about human nature, emotional life, individual responsibility, and our society's obligations to all kinds of dependent others.."" That empathy easily extends to dogs, who we’ve had social relationships with for thousands of years. Shipman: Because we’re both genetically programmed for that interaction. We have helped the survival of the ones that communicate better with us. There’s a lot of evolution underlying this. And that gives us that feeling with our cats and dogs, that they’re basically furry family members. To understand the human-dog relationship, some psychologists have invoked a concept called Attachment Theory. Most humans have this biological need to form attachments with other humans. This idea was first developed by a British psychiatrist, John Bowlby. And he believed that evolution programmed humans to form attachments to boost their chances of survival. First, it’s your mom and then you find other people... Like your friends or romantic partners. But researchers have found that we can form these attachments with our pets as well. Especially dogs. Studies have shown that dogs’ interactions with their owners are similar in some ways to infants’ responses to their mothers. They experience separation anxiety and look for &nbsp;their owners when under stress. [Dog crying] It’s a much more simpler relationship. I struggle with with anxiety a lot. A lot of times, it's anxiety about other human beings. And having a dog who I never had to question, whether or not, my dog loved me or whether or not my dog wanted to be around me. It was such an honest relationship. It might be a silly... A silly thing to cling to but it was important. It was definitely important for survival. I think that plays a part in why I was so thankful for her. Researchers have found that interacting with a dog can reduce stress hormones and blood pressure. But the unusual bond we form with dogs — a bond tens of thousands of years in the making — it means that saying goodbye is... hard. I remember one day I came home and I said I think I have to call the vet… I called my mom and couldn't say it. I just couldn't tell her that I was scheduling my dog’s death, essentially. And... Literally that night I went to a bar and from the back of the bar I Googled ‘How do you know when it’s time for your dog’ And... All the... everything that I read.... Not really helpful, because I just knew it was time. I just wanted someone to tell me that it wasn’t time for my dog... There are 2 shots. The first shot calms your dog down, and the second one stops your dog's heart. And the vet asked me ""Do you want... Just tell me when..."" ""Whenever you’re ready.” And... It's like... what do you say? “Okay, I’m ready?” So… it was very mechanical. “Okay, go ahead… okay, go ahead.” And a lot of the feelings I was having... They were very similar to when my grandma had passed away. I was there during her last days... and we knew she was passing. She was in hospice care. It was a feeling of... both it is time. You've meant so much to me... and I'm so thankful, and I don’t know how to tell you. So the reason it feels like a human has died is because dogs are a lot like us. Their life arc is our life arc. From city to suburb, from tragedy to bliss. And... when they pass away, that’s what we lose. Luna... Aww... [Laughing] This video was based on an article that Alvin wrote last year about losing Rainbow. I'll link the article down below, make sure to read it. "
73,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,9jv0-dUu4_k,"When I first learned about Iran like most people I was exposed exclusively to stuff like this: But as I started to look closer, I started to see a much different Iran then what the Islamic Republic regime represents. The reaction in Iran to the news about a potential deal is a good example of what I'm talking about. Immediately following the news of this deal with the West, people lined up to greet foreign ministers Zarif as he returned from Switzerland. They spent all night celebrating the potential lifting of sanctions and closer ties with the West. So what's going on here? Is Iran this? Or is it this? A while back I reached out to twenty five Iranians on Facebook. These were people between the ages of 21 and 35 who lived all over the country. I started following them and realizing that they were totally normal people. They posted cat videos and took pictures of  their food and talked about clothes and sports and took plenty of selfies. I never once saw a dogmatic the religious posts and I certainly never saw anything anti-western I started to realize that there is a big difference between what  I had studied about this regime and what the people were actually like. These were people who were born after  the 1979 revolution. They were not a part of the emotion and their zeal that brought about the current Iran and all of its hostilities towards the West. Instead they grew up in an environment of increase in seclusion from the world on one hand while gaining huge access to the world through the internet on the other hand So in today's Iran people are less likely to hate Americans. In my effort to befriend Iranians on Facebook, I don't have a single person reject my friend request. In fact most have them sent me a message telling me how happy they were to connect and how they would love to talk more about our different cultures. Politics wasn't a big part of this conversation. So, no matter how easy it is to label Iran is this pariah nation bent on hard-line religious fundamentalism, remember that while they're definitely supporters that ideology, there is a whole other side to this country that we rarely see. Most Iranians are normal people living normal lives. They want to connect, they want to feel safe, and they want peace as much as you and I do. That's something I think we can afford to talk about a little bit more. "
74,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,AoOeTBD1iEQ,"Let’s be clear about something: Barack Obama has been one of the most consequential presidents in recent American history. ""You can't say it, but you know it's true."" In the past eight years, he has completely transformed the American healthcare system. He got tough reforms to Wall Street passed after the biggest financial crisis in decades. He appointed two of the 4 women to ever serve on the supreme court, both of whom were part of the historic decision legalizing same sex marriage. He put in place the toughest climate regulations in American history. He opened the US to Cuba for the first time in half a century. And he reached a peaceful settlement to the nuclear standoff with Iran that lasted for a decade before he took office. You can celebrate or bemoan these accomplishments. Liberals will think they’re great, conservatives will think they’re awful. But it’s hard to deny that they’re big deals. So…. where do we start? Obamacare is a big fucking deal. For at least 100 years, the big goal of American liberals on domestic policy was to get a national health insurance program done. A lot of countries implemented universal health care in the 20th century — the UK, Canada, France — but the US always lagged behind. There were attempt after attempt after attempt by American progressives of both parties to try to get the US to where everyone else was going. And each of those attempts failed. Teddy Roosevelt failed, FDR failed, Truman failed, Nixon failed, Carter failed, Clinton failed… and then Obama succeeded. And he established for the first time in American history that healthcare is a right. The plan still leaves millions uninsured, but it laid a foundation for universal health care. To understand what Obama did for foreign policy, you have to go back to a moment in 2007, this moment in particular: “Would you be willing to meet separately without preconditions, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba, and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?” Obama: “I would. And the reason is this, that the notion that somehow not talking to countries is punishment to them, which has been the guiding diplomatic principle of this administration, is ridiculous.” So, this was considered a gaffe. The safe thing that you’re supposed to say is “yeah, diplomacy’s great, we’ll talk to some people, but there have to be preconditions. No preconditions is silly.” And this is what other Democrats did say at the time . But he didn’t accept that. And with two of the countries listed in that question — Iran and Cuba — Obama led some of the biggest changes to those diplomatic relationships in recent history. I’d be remiss in not mentioning the importance of the fact that Obama is the first black president. After 8 years it seems obvious to point out But the history of America is a history of learning to deal with racial diversity, and with the legacy of white supremacy. In a very real way the history of America is the history of race relations. There’s a famous photo that still hangs in the White House of a black toddler in the White House who asked to touch president Obama’s hair because he thought it was great that the president had hair that looked like his. It seems cheesy, but it really is a big deal that a generation of black children are going to grow up knowing that they could be the president. Overall it’s a pretty extensive track record. You can generally divide American presidents into two camps. There are the ones who were maybe a little good, a little bad, but are sorta forgettable: Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, Zachary Taylor, William Howard Taft, Bill Clinton. And then there are the ones who were hugely consequential either for good: FDR (ending the depression, winning WWII), Lincoln (winning the civil war), George Washington (establishing what a president is), or for ill. Andrew Johnson, destroying reconstruction and subjugating black people for a century. Andrew Jackson committing genocide or ethnic cleansing against the Southeast Indians. I think it’s hard to argue that Obama is in the sorta iffy, “eh” camp rather than the big consequential camp. He did a lot, he accomplished a lot. And I think in the next 10 or 20 years when we have a bunch more presidents many more of whom are alright or slightly bad but ultimately forgettable. We’re going to look back and realize what a rare thing a presidency that active and that accomplished is. "
75,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,B6L9mS9ti6o,"That’s me driving towards an authorized outpost deep into the West Bank. This is disputed land I’m driving on. And when I got to the outpost I expected the family I was meeting to hit me with an earful of ideology and a sermon on the Jews deserve this land more than Palestinians. Instead, we played music, ate the food from their land and talked more about perks of living in the desert. Close to Jerusalem, the best view, the best weather, close to my parents. Excellent. It's perfect. These people don't own guns. They don't lock their doors. I visited 15 settlement to find out what motivated people who are on the forefront of one of the world's most protracted and difficult conflicts. west bank is home to 2.2 million arabs and seen by the international community as part of a future Palestinian state, but there are more than 400,000 Israeli settlers living here now, about 5% of Israel’s population. You can learn all about how they got here in the first part of this series. Many The first Jewish settlers who trekked out here 1967 were driven by an strong ideology to claim the this land for Israel. But things have changed quite a bit since then. [People talking in English] Spend ten minutes in the settlements today and you can sometimes feel like you could just as easily be in a New Jersey suburb. [Guys talking about baseball] We're out here to play a game and gave a good time. Clean roads, big houses, quality parks, good schools, close-by shopping, a university. You ask people why they moved here and instead of the original mission to push forward the Israeli state, you hear things like.. Great educational system. There's a very nice country club. We wanted to be in a bigger place. It's a great place to raise kids. This is such a beautiful view and it's our land and we love looking at it all the time. We were looking for a Jerusalem suburb that we could afford that was a manageable commute. Close to Jerusalem..Extremely close to Jerusalem. The quality of life is so much better. It has nothing to do with politics. Having a bit more quiet. Most people here work in the city. Then you come back here at night or in the afternoon. And it's just relaxing and quiet. Between the puppet show, the bumping Bar Mitzah party, and a hundred other examples of seemingly ordinary suburban life, it’s hard to remember that these settlers are living at the edge of an intense conflict. My wife and I had certain criteria. One was we wanted to walk out our back door and be hiking in 5 minutes. There is still ideology here. Many residents of these communities feel connected to the settler’s original mission to resettle the hills of ancient Judea and Samaria, which they call… ""The cradle of our entire civilization"" But ideological motivations for living out here are usually 4 or 5 items down on the priority list, with quality of life reasons being the main drivers. To tell if you my ideological motivations were the major motivations to move over I won't lie. That wasn't one of the major things. I wasn't looking to make a statement. I was trying to find a place that would be a good place, a safe place for us to raise our kids, and this was the choice. It wasn't at all something that was one of the criteria but it ended up being a real perk. Course the hard core back-to-the-land settlers still exists. Here I am with a guy who doesn’t want his name or face in my video. He lives on an outpost, illegal even to the Israeli government. There’s no baseball league or bagel shop in his community. God promised to us that this is our land. And we can grow here if we listen to him. This renegade culture of taking over hilltops once characterized the settlement movement. But now, the zealous ideology that started the movement has been diluted by more practical factors like house prices and the quality of schools. This real estate ad for a settlement community I think perfectly captures the blend of quality of life motivations with a hint ideological fervor sprinkled in: ""If you've always had a deep yearning for Jerusalem, Now is a once in a lifetime opportunity. Not only to stand within its gates but to build the home of your dreams there. The tranquility of a picturesque setting and crisp mountain air with all the benefits of Jerusalem. Ramat Givat Zeev is adjacent to the city of Givat Zeev and is connected to Jerusalem via two main highways. But make no mistake. Threre's still a conflict here. An occupation of land that has enormous impact on the lives of Palestinians. It sounds paradoxical, but this just seems like the safest place in the world. One of the reasons life in many settlements is so peaceful and pleasant is that the government invests proportionally more public money into the settlement communities than it does mainland Israeli communities. Schools in the settlements receive better funding than mainland Israeli schools in the form of better salaries for teachers and other educational benefits. Nearly one third of all subsidized housings in Israel is in the settlements even though only 5% of Israelis live there. In the past the government ran a mortgage subsidy program that made living out here much cheaper than mainland Israel. Things like public transportation are also cheaper for settlers than mainland Israelis. An Israeli think tank found that the government spent around $950 on each West Bank resident in 2014, more than double what it spends on people living in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. The settlement enterprise has become a fixture of Israeli institutions and society -- which helps explain why you don’t need to be an ideological activist to want to live there. I can't hide the quality of life that people are enjoying here ok? I can't hide the fact that people are moving from the United State from very luxurious homes and choose to live in Efrat.. And their not suffering in Efrat. They are managing to maintain a similar quality of life. On top of government support, lots of the gyms, theaters, and parks in the settlements are funded in part by American donors with ideological motivations. So what you end up with is attractive communities that feel totally normal and livable but that are built with an ideological mission and carry heavy political significance. even unauthorized outposts that are illegal under Israeli law enjoy support from the government. Like this government-provided soldier to protect the community, a playground built by the government as well as public waste and recycling collection all in a place that is deemed illegal by the government. My house, the government built it [laughs] [Laughs] that's a fact. These places are connected to public water and electricity. They’re totally supported in spite of  being “unauthorized"". We have here everything from internet to water to electricity. Like everywhere. But often to appease the international community, the government still tries to appear tough on unauthorized settlements. Back on the illegal outpost, my contact tells me the authorities show up once every year or to knock down a settler’s house and then take a picture of it to show the world they don't allow illegal outposts. But in reality they clearly do. Since 1967 there has been government support from both right and left wing parties in Israeli politics which both have separate reasons for supporting the settlements. And while this support is not the only or even the main reason settlements are growing, but it has surely helped turn the settler experience into a mainstream, livable, and often enjoyable situation. The original mission of the settlement movement was to claim land deep into the West Bank, preventing a Palestinian State. Here are the Palestinian population centers, and here are the settlements. Any proposal for giving palestinians their own state now has to take into account the hundreds of thousands of Israelis living deep into the West Bank. No one seriously considered it possible to remove all 400 thousand residents. And while negotiations are in a stand still, Israel keeps issuing permits and settlements continue to grow. These whole peace talks are like two guys negotiating over a pizza, while one of them is eating a pizza. Just a few weeks ago the housing minister announced that he foresees this region down here growing from seven thousand residents a half a million in the next 10 years. Israeli settlements are one of the most universally condemned issues among the international community. But no matter what you think of them, it’s hard to imagine them going away any time soon. What did you think that I was living in? You thought that I was living in some sort of tent? riding camels? What did you have in your imaginary picture of the settlement movement? There are half a million people living out here in solid homes. Before 1996 there were only 100,000 Jews living over the Green Line. Today we're approaching half a million. And that number is just growing. The jewish people have come home. That's not going to change. In this video I talked to a lot of settlers whos motivations were more practical than ideological. In the next video I'm going to go to Jerusalem and talk to the settlers who are at epicenter of the conflict. Settlers whose motivations are much more ideological. I also wanted to point out that I talked to a lot of American settlers. 15% of settlers are American. I also talked to settlers from Holland, Russia and all over the place. The West Bank really is full of settlers from all over the world. "

He has long been a critic of US military intervention in Afghanistan particularly the drone strikes along the Pakistan border this anti-american sentiment resonated with large parts of the Pakistani population that see the US as an enemy his own solution for the Taliban is centered on peace talks a push that has earned him the nickname Taliban common so you're basically recommending a strategy of negotiation with the Taliban and a complete elimination of the drones if I hear you properly it is the only way believe me it is the only way what makes khan's tolerance of the Taliban interesting is that it seems to align with the interest of the Pakistani military the military's power can be traced back to 1947 when British India was divided into two countries a Muslim majority Pakistan and Hindu majority India as people migrated to the country of their religion intense violence broke out the Pakistani military stepped in to settle conflict at the border becoming a symbol of national identity and the establishment that held a new country together since then the military has controlled all national security and foreign policy matters one of their main concerns is the war in Afghanistan which benefits them in two ways on one hand the US has paid the Pakistani military billions in exchange for routes to the country to continue their fight with the Taliban at the same time the military supports the Taliban because the instability in Afghanistan keeps the country isolated from Pakistan's rivals especially India the military has also interfered with the democratic process within Pakistan since independence it has either ruled the country directly or controlled it indirectly Pakistan has had 22 prime ministers and none of them has ever completed a full term they either resigned they were terminated they finished a term they didn't start or they were assassinated there were also three successful military coups because of Pakistan's tense political past the election was high stakes in the months leading up to the vote religious extremist groups try to destabilize the electoral process by killing at least 200 people in a string of attacks including a polling station bombing on Election Day that killed 31 people just weeks before the 2018 election Khan's opponent former Prime Minister Sharif was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 10 years in jail the military was accused of engineering Sharif's downfall and clearing the wafer Khan Khan went on to win against bilawal Bhutto and Shahbaz Sharif the new candidates from Pakistan's political dynasties his win was followed by protests and accusations of election fraud which he said he would investigate and on August 18th Imran Khan was sworn in as the Prime Minister of Pakistan since the victory his corruption message has remained front and center: But his anti-american stance seems to be shifting: Whether leader will bring about the change he promised is still uncertain the only certainty is that his leadership will be shaped by his relationship with Pakistan's most powerful authority: the military.

But look at the glasses. None of them are for vision. They were for support. Through this passageway and inside a studio, sculptors created the best possible way to conceal some of the war’s most significant facial injuries. World War I is known for machine guns, tanks, and lethal gas attacks, but artillery dominated attacks on trenches. When you think of artillery, imagine cannons - guns that fired large destructive shells. This chart shows estimates of artillery rounds in battles from the American Civil War to World War I. At Gettysburg, 32,000 rounds were fired. At Somme, in 1916: 4,000,000. A staggering volume of shells dropped, creating deadly flying debris. That barrage resulted in an estimated 20,000 facial injuries, a statistic that medicine had to confront. This book about plastic surgery was published after the war, but it shows groundbreaking techniques for suturing and transplanting skin. Techniques like cartilage insertion in the nose or grafts to the ear were pioneering at the time. But some cases went beyond the abilities of these plastic surgeons. That’s where the sculptors came in. Before she was in this American Red Cross studio in Paris, Anna Coleman Ladd was a sculptor and writer in America. Having heard of the sculptor Francis Derwent Wood’s pioneering work in London, in 1917 she took his techniques to the Red Cross in France, starting her own studio there. They made casts of the injured faces, then sculpted attachments that restored the face. These were then used to make a paper thin copper-plated attachment, which Ladd and others then painted. Eyebrows and mustaches were made from real hair or tiny pieces of tinfoil, with astonishing results. They were supported by tiny ties around the ears or, more often, glasses. They made more than 150 of these masks. After the war, Anna Coleman Ladd returned to America. She sculpted many pieces similar to her pre-war work. Perfect figures, oblivious to charts about artillery. Figures who didn’t need glasses. In 1923, she created a controversial World War I memorial for the American legion in Manchester, Massachusetts. It showed a skeleton trapped in barbed wire. She once wrote about memorials, “when the masters of yesterday have passed, the masters of tomorrow will express this new sense of the futility of war and the greater power of the spirit.” Her Memorial in Manchester actually had two images. The skeleton was called night. On the other side, she put dawn. "
78,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,BShvYeyMm_Y,"The modern United States is the most powerful country in human history. With over 800 military bases and 37% of global military spending, the United States has become the leader of a vast interconnected global system that has helped usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and low levels of conflict. To understand America’s position in the world, and why it’s so pivotal for world politics as we know it, you have to go back to the country’s founding — back to when America wasn’t a global power in any sense of the word. During the first 70 years of its existence, the United States expanded in both territory and influence in North America eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean in a wave of expansionism that resulted in the wholesale slaughter of the indigenous people who populated the continent. But early Americans were deeply divided as to whether the country should expand beyond the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This became a major debate after the civil war, when some leaders, like post-war Secretary of State Seward, argued that America should push to become a global power. Seward succeeded in pushing a plan to purchase Alaska from Russia, but his attempts to buy Greenland and Iceland, as well as annex territory in the Caribbean, were all blocked by Congress. That’s because some Americans, including many on Capitol Hill, had a strong anti-imperialist bent. These people worried about America getting more involved in global politics, as well as having to integrate populations from “inferior” races. And this opposition applied major checks on the imperialist urge to expand. But something was happening in the late 1800s that would change the debate about American expansionism. The industrial revolution produced explosive economic growth, and the bigger US economy required a more centralized state and bureaucracy to manage the growing economy. Power became concentrated in the federal government, making it easier for expansionist presidents, like William Mckinley, to unilaterally push United States influence abroad. The key turning point came in 1898, when President McKinley dragged the country into war with Spain over the island of Cuba despite intense opposition. The rising US easily defeated the moribund Spanish empire, acquiring Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines in the process (1898). Over the next two years, the US would annex the Kingdom of Hawaii (1898), Wake Island (1899), and American Samoa (1900). A few years later the US took control of the Panama Canal Zone (1903) and sent troops to occupy the Dominican Republic (1916), it also purchased the American Virgin Islands (1917). This period of rapid acquisition of far flung territories put the US on the map as a truly global power. During this time, America also began using its influence to protect its growing commercial and military interests abroad, installing pro-American regimes in places like Nicaragua and playing a major role in international diplomacy regarding the Western presence in China. World War I showed how just how much America’s influence had grown. Not only was American intervention a decisive factor in the war's end But President Wilson attended the Paris Peace Conference which ended the war and attempted to set the terms of the peace. He spearheaded America’s most ambitious foreign policy initiative yet, an international organization, called the League of Nations, designed to promote peace and cooperation globally. The League, a wholesale effort to remake global politics, showed just how ambitious American foreign policy had become. Yet isolationism was still a major force in the United States. Yet isolationism was still a major force in the United States. Congress blocked the United States from joining the League of Nations, dooming Wilson’s project. During the Great Depression and the rise of Hitler, the US was was much more focused on its own region than on European affairs Ultimately, though, America’s ever-growing entanglements abroad made it impossible for it to stay out of global affairs entirely. In East Asia, the growing Japanese empire posed a the direct threat to American possessions and troops bringing the United States and Japan into conflict. This culminated in the Pearl Harbor attack bringing the United States into World War II. World War Two would transform America’s global presence forever. The United States was the only major power to avoid economic ruin during the war, and it was the sole country equipped with atomic weapons. As such, it was in unique position to set the terms of the peace — and, with the aim of preventing another war in mind, it took advantage. The most famous example of this is the creation of the United Nations. The UN charter set up a system of international law prohibiting wars of conquest, like the ones waged by the Nazis and the Japanese. It also served as a forum in which the international community could weigh in on disputes, and help resolve them. This way, the Americans hoped, great powers could resolve their differences through compromise and law rather than war. But while the UN is the most famous of the post-war institutions, it isn’t the only one. 730 delegates from all 44 Allied nations came together in a small vacation haven in New Hampshire. Their goal? To establish a global financial system that would prevent another Great Depression and World War. The resulting agreement, called the Bretton Woods Agreement  ultimately became backbone of the global financial system. Resulting in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. By creating these institutions the United States committed itself to being deeply involved in the world’s problems. The issue, though, is that the world’s second-largest power — The Soviet Union — saw things differently. World War II had made allies out of the democratic West and communist East in the fight against Hitler, but that couldn’t last. The United States saw Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe and elsewhere as a direct threat to its vision of a free-trading world. ""To a substantial degree, in one form or another"" Socialism has spread the shadow of human regimentation Over most of the nations of the earth And... the shadow is encroaching on our own liberty. Fearful of Soviet intentions towards Western Europe, the US and other European nations created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance meant to stop Russia from invading other countries in Europe. Globally, the US committed to a strategy called “containment” — so called because it was aimed at containing the spread of Communism everywhere on the globe. This new global struggle meant that the US had to exert influence everywhere, all the time. Instead of disbanding the massive military machine created for World War II, its wheels mostly kept turning. This had two main results: first, the US was pulled into unlikely alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Israel, and South Korea, seeing each of them as bulwarks against communist influence in their region. Secondly, the US began intervening, often secretly, in dozens of countries to contain Soviet influence. Sometimes this meant propping up sympathetic dictators like in Iran, other times supplying rebels with arms and money like in Afghanistan in 1979 and Nicaragua in 1985. Over the course of the Cold War, the US intervened in hundreds of disputes around the globe, ending up with a complicated set of alliances, tensions, and relationships in basically every corner of the earth. After the Berlin wall fell, the US could have withdrawn from this system, severing ties with its allies and drawing down the size of its military. And while the US did military spending, much of the military infrastructure and alliances from the Cold War war remained. Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton decided that it was in both America and the world’s interests for the United States, now the sole superpower on earth, to continue actively managing global affairs. "" We should be and we must be Peacemakers"" NATO, created solely as a tool for countering the Soviets, stayed together and even expanded, a way of keeping European nations united in the absence of the Soviet threat. Washington’s support for countries like Israel and Japan stayed intact, ostensibly as a means of preventing war in those regions. The global system of alliances and institutions created to keep the peace during the Cold War became permanent — as did the American military and political commitments needed to keep them running . This system remains in operation today, and no leading American politician since the Cold War has seriously called for dismantling them — except, perhaps for Donald Trump. Trump has said contradictory things about these commitments. But he’s consistently argued that American allies are not paying America enough for its protection, and questioned the value of free trade. That calls NATO and even the World Trade Organization into question. At some point, we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea. We're better off if South Korea is going to start to protect itself -- and Saudi Arabia?-- Saudi Arabia? Absolutely. This is a sharp divergence from the consensus that has dominated US foreign policy since 1945, and something closer to the isolationism that came before it. So will President Trump act on some of candidate Trump's ideas, and reverse decades worth of institution building and alliances? We'll find out, soon enough. "
79,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,B_1TChFSOjU,"Every ten years, states have to redraw their voting districts. In most cases, politicians get to control that process. And if they're clever about how the districts are drawn, they can make it easier for their own party to win more of them. It's called ""Partisan Gerrymandering"". And Pennsylvania is the latest state to get busted for it. So when you redistrict, there's a phenomenal degree of possible manipulation. Almost any shape you want to make is possible. Professor Cho is a political scientist who developed an algorithm that can spot unfair maps. The Court wants to be able to determine the intent behind the district maps. Basically they want to read the mind of the map drawer. It doesn't have any way to do this. Politicians have to follow a certain criteria when they're making a new map. Some criteria are required by law, for instance we have to have about the same number of people in every district and all districts have to be contiguous. In Pennsylvania, these districts also have to be compact. Then, there's other criteria that the Supreme Court has emphasized when they make decisions about redistricting. The Court wants districts that preserve political subdivisions like cities, counties, municipal boundaries. So whenever you find an identifiable community of likeminded individuals, Court likes it when those people are kept together in the same district. Pennsylvania's districts were deemed partisan because of that last guideline. If you look at the 2011 map, the lines are all contiguous and each district has a roughly equal population. But the map also divides up several counties, which violates traditional districting principles. And that made it easier for Republicans to win congressional seats in the state. The popular vote in the House race was basically equal in both elections that used this map, but the Republicans won more than twice the number of seats in Congress. Then a group of voters sued. And the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the map had to change. This is the new map. The lines are still contiguous and the population is still proportionate. But now, only 13 counties are split up instead of 28. That protects the traditional districting principles. The Republican party plans to countersue, arguing that the new map will favor Democrats. They hope to win as many as five more congressional seats in Pennsylvania because of it. And those seats could be a part of a larger shift in power in the House of Representatives. Which is why the fight over these two maps is so heated. And it's also why Pennsylvania probably won't be the last state to get called out for gerrymandering. "

Angkor wat sits only a couple miles away -- it's the largest religious monument ever built. But Ta-Prohm is a bit more human scale. And it has merged with nature It's original name was Raja Vihara -- the royal monastery -- and was dedicated to the Buddhist personification of wisdom. But it is a new place now, silk-cotton trees and strangler figs have merged with the carved rocks to create new structures. The temple was built about 1000 years ago, around 1186, just after Angkor wat, during the golden age of the Khmer empire in what's now Cambodia. The Khmer controlled most of southeast Asia, and the capital city Angkor was the biggest urban center in the world before the industrial revolution. They had incredible technology to support such a large congregation of humans for the time. Southeast Asia gets heavy rainfall in one season, and less in another -- so the Khmer built water management Huge reservoirs, canals, channels and dikes allowed them 3 harvests a year. It might have been the best technology of the time. They built the temples at their peak. Khmer empire ruler Jayavaraman VII, who also built Angkor Thom nearby, is the man credited. But a man's name doesn't really capture the true size of the project. About 2 or 300 years later, the society collapsed. It wasn't all at once, or for one reason. But a factor archeologists and ecologists hypothesized was that the incredible water management system failed due to a change in the climate -- dire drought, then heavy floods. This possibility had been hypothesized before, but a PHD student named Mary Beth Day spent 6 years digging and found evidence for the theory in the form of sediment records in the reservoir. What also is sure is that the ruling class moved south. It's a beautiful place, but haunting: what hundreds of thousands people would be living here had it survived? For around 400 or 500 years the forest merged with Ta-prohm until it was 're-discovered'. It should give us pause. Our civilization is a collaboration with nature. A giant structure must sway with the wind and roll with the earthquakes, or else it will surely, quietly, fall. Hollywood films often depict the destruction of urban centers. But the crisis comes at once, so we can band together to fight it. In reality, giant cities have existed and then died before. This one did. It just takes time -- the rain falls, the roots grow, and nature eats what we built. The best technology of the time wasn't enough. "
81,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,CgKpACQyhgk,"When you think of the street gang MS-13, what do you see? Maybe, something like this. Or this. But what if I told you the typical MS-13 gang member in the US actually looks like one of these young men on Facebook? They’re around 18 years old, they like selfies, and memes about the Joker. And the young men in these photos have all been charged with or convicted of horrific crimes. “The gang has committed 27 murders.” “Taking advantage of illegal immigrants.” MS-13 has become notorious for committing some brutal crimes. But, that’s not all we hear about them. “MS-13 takes advantage of glaring loopholes in our immigration laws."" “Violated our borders."" “Let MS-13 all over our country.” “Not with me, we’re taking them out by the thousands.” The Trump Administration has made MS-13 the most visible symbol of why the United States needs tougher immigration policies -- especially as a reason to point a finger at Central American immigrants. But, here’s the thing -- MS-13 was born right here in the United States. In the 1980s, a US-backed war against the Salvadoran rebels raged in El Salvador. Nearly a million Salvadorans escaped the violence and fled to the US as undocumented immigrants. “There to protect themselves from American gang violence, young Salvadorans formed MS-13.” This is 100 percent an American born gang. It comes out of the Salvadoran immigrant community in Los Angeles. You know, a group of teenagers hanging out smoking pot listening to rock music. They called themselves the “Stoners,” later “Mara Salvatrucha,” and eventually, MS-13. At the time, they were mostly juvenile delinquents involved in street crimes, who were stuffed into American jails. Eventually, in the 90s and early 2000s, the US sent large numbers of convicted immigrants back to El Salvador. “Today 103 dangerous individuals are off the streets and will no longer be a threat to those communities or the United States.” But the strategy of deporting the MS-13 problem - didn’t quite succeed. “One of the most violent street gangs in the country, the gang is known as Mara Salvatrucha.” “What the FBI is now calling the most dangerous gang in America.” “Violent criminals who represent a more immediate threat to Americans here at home than terrorists.” MS-13 members eventually set up cliques on the East Coast of the US, concentrated in the suburbs of Boston, DC, and Long Island. I've been reporting on Long Island for a year and the MS-13 that I'm seeing on the ground there has almost nothing in common with the MS-13 as portrayed by the government. For one, the Trump administration presents MS-13 as a drug cartel. ""They're drug smugglers."" But that’s not really the case. MS-13 is not really involved with the international drug trade. The MS-13 members that I've been following are working after school jobs. They're living with their parents. They get around Long Island on bicycles because they can't afford cars. It's not the kind of gang that you really get any money from. MS-13 isn’t a highly organized criminal group -- it doesn’t have a central leader or global ambitions. But it’s been classified as a &nbsp;“transnational criminal organization.” The Obama-era Treasury Department put the group on a list of sanctioned organizations with groups like the Mexican Zetas and the Japanese Yakuza. But... The organization doesn’t have that kind of sophistication to really play with the major players. Yet MS-13 alarmism has persisted -- for decades. “MS-13 has the potential to be far more dangerous than gangs like the Bloods and Crips.” “One of the fastest growing gangs in our nation.” “It’s a fact MS-13 is the fastest growing gang in the United States.” Even though MS-13 has stuck around, it’s not actually growing. The estimates of MS-13 size in the U.S. have kind of ping ponged between 5,000 and 10,000 for the last 10 to 15 years. There's no indication that we're seeing a bigger surge of MS-13 than we'd seen in the past. But even based on the government’s rough estimates, MS-13 accounts for a tiny fraction of street gang members in the US, which are said to be about 1.4 million. Of that, the Crips, based primarily in Southern California, have an estimated 35,000 members. Lesser known groups, like Chicago’s Gangster Disciples, have about 50,000 members. But MS-13 is likely the gang we hear about the most. Now, with Central American immigrants seeking asylum at the US Border, the Trump administration has raised a new concern about MS-13 posing as fake families. “The kids are being used by pawns. Those are traffickers, those are smugglers, that is MS-13. Those are criminals, those are abusers.” In reality, out of over 30,000 families apprehended at the border this fiscal year, only 200 were fake families and there’s no evidence to tie any of them to MS-13. The administration has said that it is carrying out aggressive immigration raids to pick up MS-13 members... “We are sending MS-13 out by the thousands."" But they may actually be picking up the gang’s victims. The targets of MS-13 violence are the exact same Salvadoran-American immigrants who are the targets of MS-13's recruitment. It can be hard to tell who’s really in the gang and who’s just adopting gang style. Kids in high school will wear Chicago Bulls t-shirts or will wear Nike Cortez sneakers. And that is a sign of the gang but it’s also just a sign of a high school kid trying to look tough. It's the same thing you saw in the 90s, you saw kids who would have like a blue bandana to try to act like Snoop Dogg, but that didn't mean that they were Crips. If we're trying to send a message that we don't want MS-13 in the U.S, but that message comes at the cost of hurting the exact same people who MS-13 is victimizing, is that really the right way to go forward? For any policy to work, it’s worth keeping the facts front and center. MS-13 is not invading the country. They’re neither a new phenomenon nor growing in numbers. But they have committed acts of horrific violence, mostly against other immigrants, in specific communities. And that -- is still an American problem. "

And a man approached me. He started describing the horrendous violence that had happened there. He said government troops came in and killed his 5 year old child and forced him to eat some of her body..."" That’s Jane Ferguson, a journalist who was just in South Sudan covering a famine that’s left about 100,000 people starving and 5.5 million at risk. She was here in Unity, a state where the UN officially declared a famine in February 2017. It's also where the worst violence in South Sudan’s 4 year old civil war has taken place, and that’s not a coincidence... The violence has destroyed crops and markets and has forced people to flee. As a result there’s no food. In the past, humanitarian aid has been the best solution for famines. But today, the South Sudanese government is blocking access to much of the country in an attempt to starve the rebels. It's why South Sudan’s famine is man-made. And so are the 3 other famines developing in Nigeria, Somalia, and Yemen. Wars in these countries are threatening to starve 20 million people ""No one country is the same, no one conflict is the same, but what we are seeing are some very dangerous patterns; the use of food, or lack there of, as a weapon Fighting groups in each country have created food shortages to starve each other. South Sudan became an independent country in 2011, but fell into civil war just 2 years later. It started as a personal rivalry between president Salva Kiir and former vice president Riek Machar. But with each leader belonging to a different ethnic group, it soon became a tribal conflict. What we see now is this war almost cannibalizing, where its disintegrating into smaller and smaller groups across the country. What we saw when we got there is clear evidence of ethnic cleansing."" The government has blocked humanitarian aid to parts of rebel territory, leaving millions of civilians trapped without access to food. And it’s created chaos. The fighting has forced tens of thousands to leave their homes, often for dense marshlands that surround cities. ""It’s such a good hiding place but it’s also where people starve to death. They have no means of finding food."" There’s a similar situation in Nigeria, where the government’s been fighting the Islamist militant group, Boko Haram since 2009. The terrorist group controls large portions of Borno State. And its responsible for mass killings, suicide bombings, and kidnappings in the region. Their violent tactics have displaced nearly 2 million people and collapsed the agricultural economy. The Nigerian government restricts aid to keep supplies from reaching Boko Haram territory, where civilians continue to be at risk of starvation. Over in Somalia, another al-Qaeda linked terrorist group al-Shabaab controls at least 10% the country. Getting aid to those areas has proven difficult as well. Back in 2011, during the last famine, the group killed aid workers and looted supply trucks. Now a drought has re-created severe famine conditions in Somalia. And limited access to humanitarian aid has made the situation worse. This time Al-shabaab claims it will allow people to move and find aid, but if they don’t, millions will be trapped without food again. The clearest example of a man-made famine is just north of Somalia, across the Gulf of Aden, in Yemen. Civil war broke out in 2014 between the government and a rebel group called the Houthis. They’ve received weapons, personnel, and support from Iran. In response, Saudi Arabia, Iran’s rival in the Middle East, intervened in 2015 on behalf of the government. It began bombing Houthi territory, but also roads, bridges, and ports to block Iranian supplies. Saudis also set up a naval blockade that keeps 85% of the food supplies out of Yemen. Meanwhile, in the interior, 7 million people are at risk of starvation. Yemen's food shortage is caused by internal conflict but it's controlled by the geopolitics of the region. This makes man-made famines incredibly hard to solve. ""So, if it comes down to simply trying to save lives, that’s easy to do, unless you cannot get access, unless there are warring sides trying to push hunger deliberately on people, and unless the food simply can’t reach them. If you get food to people they won’t starve to death. That's why its not particularly complicated."" But the crisis is only getting worse. Massive streams of refugees are overwhelming neighboring countries. Uganda’s BidiBidi camp now holds 800,000 people making it the largest refugee camp in the world. Overcrowded camps are breeding ground for disease, and cholera outbreaks have been reported across the entire region. It’s why humanitarian groups are struggling to keep up. The UN reports that it needs $4.4 billion to address the famines, and they've only raised 14% of that so far. But if the conflicts that are driving these famines aren’t addressed, no amount of aid will solve these man-made crises. "

And some of the most renowned musicians have declared their love for them. This instrument has a soul and it has an imagination. It's not a tool. It is a part -- it's a total extension of me. Strads, as they're sometimes called, are incredibly valuable and can be worth up to 16 million dollars. But are they actually worth it? I headed up to Lincoln Center to meet Michelle Kim to find out. I am the assistant concert master of the New York Philharmonic. The characteristic of a Strad in general is that it has a silvery tone. And it creates this incredibly sweet tone, so if you were... For me the Strad has a sweet quality to it, but also able to take some blows. So if I were to play something really hard... and versus you know something... By playing on my daughter's instrument I would have had to... press kind of hard to to make that sound come out, but you would lose the quality that you're actually looking for. The source of the Strad's brilliant sound can be traced back to its maker artisan Antonio Stradivari was a luthier or violin maker who lived in Cremona, Italy in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. He crafted these string instruments for most of his life and produced an estimated 1,100 instruments in his lifetime. But only about 650 survived today. These instruments are rare and there's a long tradition of nicknaming them. The 310 year-old violin that Philippe plays is called Ruby. I have to admit, I'm a little nervous to be around that. My god, please don't do that. I googled the gemstone the ruby and the description, I think was that it's a stone of passion and mystery. And immediately I attributed these qualities to this violin and to this day I really feel that it's true. For generations, musicians have claimed that Strads have a superior sound to modern violins, but can most people actually tell the difference? Researchers in Paris performed a double-blind study with professional violinists, to see if they could tell the difference between old Italian violins like Strads and new violins. They had musicians wear very cool sunglasses while they played multiple instruments from each era. The study found that even elite musicians couldn't reliably tell which violins were old and which were new. And maybe more surprisingly, most of them actually preferred the sound of the new violins over the Strads. One measure of This is Joseph Curtin, one of the researchers behind the study and a violin maker himself. But maybe the worth of a Strad isn't wrapped up in its sound alone. Michelle's violin has been passed down through generations of violinists for almost 300 years, from the Duke of Cambridge, to the German composer Louis Spohr, to Ureli Corelli, the founder of the New York Philharmonic. It is literally a link to the past. It is a piece of history that you are holding. I feel like this violin is the New York Philharmonic, because it has existed as long as the New York Philharmonic has. It's been amazing to be a part of this Strad's life. "
84,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,ENw2y0ek1Jg,"Every time there’s another mass shooting in America — politicians have the same idea. It’s time to require a background check for anyone who wants to buy a gun. I’m one of the Republicans who does believe there should be background checks. It is an open secret that the existing background check system is broken. Oh I have an appetite for background checks. We’re going to be doing background checks. Here’s what they want to change: Right now, gun buyers in the US only have to go through a background check at a gun store. But they don’t have to go through one if they buy a gun from an unlicensed dealer, like at a gun show or a private sale. But with universal background checks, everyone who buys a gun would go through one. Pretty much every American is in favor of this. There’s only one problem. Universal background checks won’t solve America’s gun crisis. But there’s something else that might. To understand how background checks work, it helps to imagine two very different people, who both want to buy a gun. This first person is dangerous. Maybe he has a history of domestic violence or mental illness. And most importantly — he has a record. And the second one is not dangerous. He just wants a gun for protection or to go hunting or cause shooting guns is kinda fun. Before either one can buy a gun, they first have to go through an FBI instant background check. And I mean instant — it only takes an average of 108 seconds to get a response from the FBI’s database. That database is made up of records sent in by state police and other agencies. And it’s checked to see if the buyer has things like a criminal record, addiction, a restraining order or has been hospitalized for a mental illness. Under a universal background check system, anyone buying a gun — whether in a gun store, or through a private sale — would have to be checked through that database. That means our second person walks out with a gun. And our first person, with a criminal record, doesn’t. Or, at least he shouldn’t. I’ve done a lot of reporting on this, we have just seen time and time again background checks just do not stop people we don’t want having guns from actually getting the weapons. There are a couple problems with the background check system. One is that the FBI database is about as outdated as its logo. It’s missing millions of records. That’s why the Charleston church shooter was able to buy a gun, despite having a record. Or why the man who killed 26 Texan churchgoers was also able to pass a background check, after the Air Force failed to send his domestic abuse convictions to the FBI. So even with a background check for every type of sale, there’s still a chance this guy gets a gun. That’s partly why study after study has found that while background checks “prevent, or make substantially more difficult, the criminal acquisition of firearms.” Making them universal doesn’t actually have any effect on the actual gun crisis in America: gun deaths. A Johns Hopkins study of California, where comprehensive background checks were implemented in 1991, found the law was “not associated with changes in firearm suicide or homicide.” Thanks in part to those incomplete and missing records. The other problem is that background checks only look at “good” people and “already bad” people. But there is an in between. The background checks are supposed to catch people who have a record already. It just misses all the people who haven’t done anything bad yet but might do something bad in the future. German is not advocating for a Minority Report situation. He’s talking about someone like this guy, who is also dangerous, but who doesn’t have a record. Under a universal background check system — he could get a gun. In 108 seconds. But there’s another system that could prevent this. Twelve states and Washington, DC have gone one step further and established a licensing system. How’s it different? Well, Here’s how it works in Massachusetts: Before you ever go to a gun store, you first have to take a firearm safety course. Then you go to the police department and submit an application, give references and give your fingerprints for a background check. Then not only is the FBI database checked, but all local law enforcement agencies wherever you’ve lived are directly contacted, along with the Department of Mental Health. That entire process in Massachusetts usually takes about 3 weeks. And most people‚ about 97% — pass. Nothing about a gun licensing system will prevent a law-abiding citizen from going through the process and obtaining a firearm. That’s Dr. Cassandra Crifasi, she researches health policy at Johns Hopkins, and she’s one of the authors of the studies earlier. And she says the reason licensing works is that it’s designed to do both of the big things background checks fail at. A, to properly identify and screen out people who shouldn’t have guns. And B, create a system to reduce impulsive gun purchases. The licensing system is more comprehensive than the one-database background check system, so our criminal will be reliably denied a gun. But because it’s so meticulous it also stands a chance of keeping our third guy, without a record, from getting a gun. There are people who, may want to impulsively acquire a firearm, for example to harm themselves or others. And the process of obtaining a license can at least delay that person during that time of crisis or maybe deter them from getting that firearm at all. In 1995, Connecticut implemented a licensing system. Over the next 10 years, they saw a drop in gun homicides and gun suicides. Compare that to Missouri, which once had a licensing system, but got rid of it in 2007. Over the next decade, they had a huge spike in homicides and gun suicides. In both states there were lots of factors involved. But researchers say this shows that licensing works. It’s also… pretty popular. Among voters who live in a house with a gun, more than two-thirds think that it’s a good idea. Ask all Americans and more than three-quarters support it. Background checks are supposed to stop bad people from getting guns. But they often don’t. Licensing picks up that slack. By making sure that people are crossing these hurdles, we just make sure, in a much better, stronger way, that people are not getting firearms when they shouldn’t have them. "
85,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,EbjKcHPmxKQ,"One of the mistakes people make about climate change is saying that the planet is at stake. ""Is it the last chance to save the planet from climate change?"" ""Tens of thousands of activists warning climate change is destroying the earth."" ""The biggest cause in Hollywood is saving the Earth. Climate change and all that."" That’s not really the right way to think about it. Earth has gone through immense climate changes many, many times before, in some cases leading to mass extinctions. but life persisted. Mammals evolved from reptiles, and primates from mammals. They stood up. And walked out of Africa, eventually reaching the corners of every continent. But Only after well over 100,000 years of wandering did the real human innovation happen, when 12,000 years ago we stopped foraging and started farming. Agriculture meant villages, cities, society, government: the birth of civilization. but why did it take so long for humans to take control of their food? well If you look at this chart of global temperature change going back 100,000 years, you might notice something special about the last 10,000 years. That’s when the climate settled into a period of unusual stability. It was on this ledge that human society developed, where reliable seasons fed more and more people...where knowledge accumulated and science began. Until eventually, inventors created machines that could unleash unimaginable growth and mobility. All they needed was fuel to burn. and they found it in the form of ancient forests buried for under dirt and compacted over 300 million years. With these coal deposits, humans unearthed tons and tons of carbon that had been locked away long before our species appeared. And that’s how we began to disrupt the climate that birthed us — the climate that our food systems and infrastructure are built upon. After 10,000 years of temperatures that varied only within about 1 degree Celsius, scientists now say we’re on track for 3 degrees of warming by 2100 if we don’t change course. Humans have been around for .004% of Earth’s history. And of all human history - the 200,000 years since our species began, we’ve had agriculture for just 5% of that time. We’ve had electricity for .07% of that time. The simple truth about climate change is that it isn’t new to the planet, but civilization is. Andd here's what's even newer: In the past hundred years, the number of people alive has quadrupled. And thus so has the capacity for suffering So slowing climate change isn’t about saving the planet. It’s about us, about our vulnerability to a level of climate disruption that human civilization has simply never seen before. "
86,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,EvXROXiIpvQ,"There’s a new highway in Pakistan. And a new rail terminal in Kazakhstan. A sea port in Sri Lanka recently opened. As well as this bridge in rural Laos. What’s interesting is that they’re all part of one country’s project that spans 3 continents and touches over 60% of the world’s population. If you connect the dots, it’s not hard to see which country that is. This is China's Belt and Road Initiative -- the most ambitious infrastructure project in modern history that's designed to reroute global trade. It's how China plans to become the world’s next superpower. It’s 2013 and Chinese president, Xi Jinping is giving a speech in Kazakhstan where he mentions the Ancient Silk Road: A network of trade routes that spread goods, ideas, and culture across Europe, the Middle East, and China as far back as 200 BC. He then says: ""we should take an innovative approach and jointly build an economic belt along the Silk Road"" A month later, Xi is in Indonesia: ""The two sides should work together to build a maritime silk road for the 21st century"" These two phrases were the first mentions of Xi’s legacy project, the multi-trillion dollar Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI. They’re also the two components of the plan. There’s an overland Economic Belt of 6 corridors that serves as new routes to get goods in and out of China. Like this railroad connecting China to London. And these gas pipelines from the Caspian sea to China And a high-speed train network in South East Asia. Then there’s the maritime silk road -- a chain of seaports stretching from the South China Sea to Africa that also directs trade to and from China. The BRI also includes oil refineries, industrial parks, power plants, mines, and fiber-optic networks - all designed to make it easier for the world to trade with China. So far, over 60 countries have reportedly signed agreements for these projects. And the list is growing, because China promotes it as a win-win for everyone. Take, for example, the BRI’s flagship project: Pakistan. Pause for Pakistan Like many countries in Central and South Asia, Pakistan has a stagnant economy, and a corruption problem. It wasn’t a popular place for foreign investment, that is until China came along. In 2001, China offered to build a brand new port in the small fishing town of Gwadar. By 2018, the port as well as highway and railway networks became a $62 billion dollar Corridor within the BRI. It’s where the Economic Belt meets the Maritime Silk Road. And it seemed to benefit both countries. Pakistan saw its highest GDP growth in 8 years and forged a tight relationship with a major world power. China, on the other hand, secured a new alternative route for goods, especially, oil and gas from the Middle East. Through projects like these, it also found a way to boost its economy. Chinese construction companies that had fewer opportunities within their own country saw a huge boost from BRI contracts — 7 out of the 10 biggest construction firms in the world are now Chinese. What tips the balance in China’s favor even more is a requirement that it be involved in building these projects. In Pakistan for example, Chinese workers have directly built projects, like this highway here, and a Chinese firm has worked with locals on a railway here in Serbia. China’s involvement is one of its very few demands and that’s set these deals apart so far. See, typically, to get investment from the West, countries have to meet strict ethical standards. But China’s offered billions of dollars — mostly in loans — with far fewer conditions. So, it’s no surprise the BRI has been a big hit with the less-democratic countries in the region. China has signed agreements with Authoritarian governments Military regimes. And some of the most corrupt countries in the world. It’s even affiliated with, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Yemen, and Iraq; all currently splintered by conflict. Because of China's willingness to loan money to unreliable countries, many experts have called the BRI a risky plan. Eventually, these countries will have to pay China back -- but corruption and conflict make that payback unlikely. A recent report found that many countries indebted to China are vulnerable, including 8 that are at high risk of being unable to pay. So why does China keep lending? Because there’s more to the BRI than just economics: In Sri Lanka, China loaned about 1.5 billion dollars for a new deep-water port. It was a key stop on the Maritime Silk Road. But by 2017 it was clear Sri Lanka couldn’t pay back the loan, so instead, they gave China control of the port as part of a 99-year lease. China also controls the strategic port in Pakistan - where it has a 40-year lease, It’s pushing for a similar agreement in Myanmar, and it just opened an actual Chinese naval base in Djibouti. These are all signs of what’s called the String of Pearls theory. It predicts that China is trying to establish a string of naval bases in the Indian Ocean that will allow it to station ships and guard shipping routes that move through the region. So while China’s not getting its money back, its still achieving some very important strategic goals. China’s growing influence challenges the status of the US, which has been the world’s lone super-power for the last several decades. Isolation is trending in the US meaning it’s investing less and therefore losing influence around the world. The BRI is China's way of leveraging power to become a global leader. By building relationships and taking control of global trade, China is well on its way. "

At first blush it seems very simple: The United States Israel allies they're both opposed to Iran. But the way these negotiations have gone down has severely  complicated the matter. To understand by we need to look at the individual personalities that are involved in the negotiations. First off, and perhaps most importantly is President Obama. Resolving the Iranian nuclear standoff peacefully is a major foreign policy priority for President Obama however it's difficult to resolve given supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is rather hostile to Western interests specifically the United States. However while he does have final control over the Iranian government he can be pushed by factions inside Iran specifically more moderate ones that are interest in sanctions relief in exchange for a deal President Hassan Rouhani is widely seen one of these modern figures and his 2013 election suggested too many americans that Iran and the supreme leader might be willing to make a deal. This has infuriated America's ally in Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees the Iranian nuclear programs as an existential threat. Netanyahu:  ""we need a better deal a different deal because this new would leave Iran was sufficient capability 6,000 centrifuges enables them to break out to a bomb very quickly.""  This has  put Netanyahu at odds with Obama, and order to deal with this disagreement he's turned to republicans in the United States Boehner: ""I've invited prime minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to address a joint session of Congress"" Netanyahu: That's why this deal is so bad. It doesn't block Iran's path to the bomb it paves Iran's path to the bomb."" News reporter: ""47 Republican senators put their names today to this open letter to Iran.""  This type of alliance between a foreign leader and domestic american opposition it basically unprecedented. So you've got a strange situation where the United States is at loggerheads with its closest ally in the Middle East, where the United States is divided amongst itself on foreign policy and where you've got President Obama desperately trying to bolster the standing of moderates inside Iran, a country the United States has regarded as a serious enemy since 1979.

It’s healthy and fun, everyone’s doing it on Instagram, and it’s the perfect time to snap some aggressively enthusiastic nature pics for your Tinder profile. But, before you rush into the woods with a selfie-stick or hang out in the fields you need to be aware of these little bastards. Tickborne diseases are on the rise. Cases of Lyme disease in particular have almost tripled in the last two decades in the US. Why are there so many more ticks in the country? Researchers point to climate change as one of the main reasons. Lyme disease is the most common vector-borne disease in the US. The bacteria typically lives in mice, birds, deer, and other animals that ticks like to feed on. But it finds its way to humans when infected ticks casually latch on to them in wooded areas. The bacteria enters the human system via tick bites — though in most cases, the tick must be attached to the skin for 36 hours or more for the disease to be transmitted. Lyme disease has a variety of symptoms at various stages including: fever, headache, fatigue, muscle and joint aches, and the classic bulls-eye rash. Catching the disease early is crucial so antibiotics can be used to treat Lyme. But if it’s left untreated the infection can spread to other parts of the body like the heart and the brain and the effects can be much more dangerous. In some cases, though, the disease can mysteriously persist for years even after treatment and researchers haven’t figured out why. Lyme can be incredibly hard to diagnose. But all kinds of ticks don’t make you sick. This map shows Lyme disease carrying ticks in the US — the western black legged tick along the Pacific coast, and the black legged tick in the northeast and upper midwest. You can see the increasing concentration of Lyme cases on the Eastern Seaboard from 2001 through 2015. And the CDC states that, 95% of confirmed cases were reported from these 14 states. Researchers believe climate change has a lot to do with this dramatic rise of Lyme disease in the Northeast. See ticks don’t survive in cold climates, so warmer winters are allowing them to venture further up north. Higher temperatures are also boosting their reproduction cycle. Among other explanations, the increase in deer populations because of hunting protections is one of them. And reforestation of former farmlands in the Northeast is also giving ticks more hosts to feed ... and reproduce on? Damn. Ticks are having sex on deer and Carlos can't even get a date right now. Carlos off-camera: Yes, I can! Me: Heyyy! Right! Lyme disease! Uhhhh, people are also moving further into the suburbs which puts them closer to tick territory in wooded areas. A weird additional factor that's helped spread Lyme disease is the recent abundance of acorns in the US. More acorns means more food for mice, and increased mice populations means more hosts to carry Lyme-infected ticks. So what do you do when you're dying for that communing-with-nature-selfie, but you don’t want to be the dinner host to guests who actually suck the life out of you? Well, before you head outdoors you can treat your clothes and shoes with an insecticide called permethrin. Using insect repellents containing DEET or picaridin, is also suggested by the CDC. Wearing light-colored clothing, long-sleeved shirts, and hats make it easier to spot ticks. And though it’s not the most fashionable statement, tucking your pants into your socks or boots helps too. When you’re back indoors, showering within two hours, and doing a full body check for ticks is in order. I’m talking scalp, elbows, knees, buttche...you get the picture. Check your clothes for ticks, then toss those in the dryer. And if you find a tick attached? Now is not the time for folklore remedies, the tick needs to be removed ASAP. Remove it with fine tipped tweezers. And watch for Lyme  disease symptoms over the next few weeks. Lastly, don’t panic if you find out you’re a total tick magnet. Carlos off camera: Gross. [whispers] Yeah...Sor...my bad .. my bad... The most important thing is being aware of possible bug-a-boo... I mean ticks in your vicinity and the measures you can take to protect yourself from Lyme disease. "

But for me, drinking makes me feel less confident and UNcomfortable. That’s because, thanks to my DNA, alcohol makes my skin turn red. It’s called Asian flush, and it affects about 36% percent of Northeast Asians, with higher rates among Asian Americans. I guess We should probably show you what it looks like. [For Science. For Science.] [Are we slamming?] People tend to assume that a red face means that we’re drunk but that’s a myth. These are completely separate processes. Facial flushing, whether from embarrassment, exercise, or alcohol, happens when blood vessels under the surface of the skin dilate. In the case of Asian flush, this is part of an immune response. The body is detecting a threat. The threat isn’t the alcohol itself, but a substance that our livers produce while breaking down alcohol. [For me at least, the warmth starts in my chest and then moves its way up.] [My cheeks are warm, my ears are warm.] [It’s weird, it’s almost like my eyes are almost puffy] When people drink ethanol - that’s the chemical name for booze - the liver gets rid of it using two main enzymes. The first reacts with the ethanol molecule to produce a substance called acetaldehyde. And the second quickly turns acetaldehyde into acetate, which is similar to vinegar, and easy for the body to eliminate. It’s that second enzyme that really screws things up for people with Asian flush. If you look inside our DNA, you’ll find that the gene providing the instructions for that enzyme was tweaked at some point in our history. And that gene mutation produces an inactive enzyme. So when we drink our bodies accumulate acetaldehyde at a level about 6 times higher than normal If acetaldehyde sounds familiar, that may be because it’s similar to formaldehyde. It’s toxic. that's why it triggers the immune response. And the red face is really the least of it. After having that one beer, I didn’t feel tipsy at all, but my heart rate doubled. My eyes were bloodshot, and within a half hour, I had a headache. Even worse, acetaldehyde can cause cancer. It’s a problem because people actually can develop a tolerance to Asian flush, and that allows them to drink pretty heavily. Studies have shown that heavy drinking raises the risk of esophageal cancer for everyone, but especially for people with Asian flush. So it’s potentially problematic that alcohol consumption in Asia has been increasing, especially in China. So if you have Asian flush, be careful - your body is freaking out for a reason. And if you don’t flush, just don’t expect us to keep up with you. "
90,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,GGm0FQ6i74U,"Ezra Klein: Secretary Clinton, thank you for being here. Hillary Rodham Clinton: Thank you, Ezra, glad to talk to you again. EK: So I wanted to start with a part of the book that surprised me the most, which was you almost ran on the beginning of a universal basic income in America, which you were gonna call Alaska for America. Tell me a bit about that idea and why it didn’t make it into the final campaign. HRC: Well I wanted very much to convey a commitment to trying to figure out ways to raise incomes. Most of the emphasis on the campaign was, as you know, on jobs and some big projects like, really, the infrastructure program that I put forward. But I was also really interested in what else we were gonna be needing to do. And so I looked at a couple of different approaches to what’s called UBI, universal basic income. The experiments that had been tried elsewhere. And the Alaska for America idea was really intriguing to me because in effect it was to argue that our natural patrimony really does belong to every American — to try to break mindset that the extraction of resources is a totally private sector effort. That we, as Americans, have a stake in it for all the reasons that you can understand. And the Alaska model where they write a check to every single Alaskan every year based on a formula about the oil and gas revenues was really intriguing to me. And we dug deep, we tried to explain it to some people, and it just was hard for people to grasp what we were talking about because most Americans in the Lower 48, as we like to say, didn’t have any idea about what was going on in Alaska. So I kept looking for an opportunity to put it in but not to make it a centerpiece of the campaign. EK: What would’ve going into a program like that? When you talk about our natural patrimony, what would have been the inputs to that income? HRC: Well that was one of the challenges we had — trying to figure out exactly, when you look nationwide, are we talking about fossil fuels, which then might perversely encourage the continued extraction of fossil fuels, which would be an outcome that we weren’t necessarily thinking was in the best interest. Other kinds of natural patrimony — whether it’s minerals or anything else that you could look at and say, “Extracting that, making private profit off of that, is really part of America’s legacy.” There were lots of really interesting questions. We debated it for a long time — the fossil fuels, climate change issues was one of the complications. EK: So the reason I start with that is when you talk about, in the book, you say at the end, “You know, maybe I should’ve proposed that and left the details to be worked out later.” And it seems to me that this is one of the pieces of the campaign that you’ve been left reevaluating. You say that you now have more of an appreciation for the power of big, galvanizing ideas. Do you think that one of the lessons of watching Bernie Sanders, of watching Donald Trump, is that perhaps the correct role for policy in a campaign is to inspire? And that the place for technocratically sound, more pragmatic policy is in the legislative process? HRC: Well, that certainly is a fair conclusion to draw from the way I try to raise the question. If I could, Ezra, because you’re a policy person and I love that about you, let me talk about this a little bit more, because this was a struggle from the very beginning. This wasn’t something that I only thought about retroactively. I felt that I was in the following posture: I was running to succeed a two-term president from my own party who I happen to believe did a really good job on some very difficult issues. And whether it was saving the economy, saving the auto industry, getting us on the path to universal health coverage with the Affordable Care Act, I knew how hard it was to actually get to where we got. And I worried that if I were to say, “Well, let’s go all the way, you know, with this and we’ll leave the details ‘til later,” the natural question is, “Well, why didn’t that happen before?” And I knew that would be my burden to bear, because I would have the responsibility having been in the administration to be able to answer that question. Secondly, I don’t think I’m held to same standard as anybody else. I believed that if I were to say let’s do a carbon tax, let’s do single-payer tomorrow, let’s do whatever it is that might be viewed as universal and inspiring, unlike either my primary opponent or my general election opponent, who were never pinned down — except in one case in the primary with respect to Sen. Sanders — I would’ve been hammered all the time. “Okay, how are you going to do that? How are you going to pay for it? Where’s the money going to come from?” If I had said we are going to leave it to the legislative process over here, they’ll figure it out, people would’ve said, “Well, you’ve been around, you know how it works. How are you going to do that? You don’t have 60 votes.” I think I would have been hit with a thousand different legitimate questions, and I think I would have felt an obligation to answer. So finally, you know, I do think policy matters, and I think where I came out really made sense for the country, made sense for the Democratic candidate. But it was hard to compete with, you know, just the big claims and the assertions that I got from both sides. And maybe I could’ve been — in fact, I’m sure I could’ve been — somewhat more adept at trying to maneuver through that, so that I got the benefit of saying here’s what we are going to do. I thought saying, “Look, we are gonna get to universal coverage ’cause that’s my goal — we’re at 90 percent now. I think getting from 90 to 100 is a lot easier than starting over” — I thought that made sense to people. I think in the end, a lot of people who were going to vote for me believed that. But, you know, that’s what you do when you take a retrospective, like what could I have done differently? EK: So as someone that would have been asking those agenda questions — HRC: You would’ve been pinning me down, and it would have been quite hard! EK: And here is my question on that, though: Do you think that those questions matter because people would care about them? Or because you would care about them? Something that I have observed watching Trump and other politicians in this era is that a lot of what we thought can hurt a politician is actually a relationship between them and the press. It’s their own shame, their own sense that they’ve been pinned down, their own desire to actually respond to what they feel is a fair critique. If you just don’t have that desire, if you don’t care about that particular kind of critique, it appears to lose at least some of its power. HRC: Ezra, you are 100 percent right. EK: Thank you. HRC: I feel like we are having a therapy session in front of this camera. You are 100 percent right, and I can’t change who I am. I knew that. I knew that I am not someone who will say things that aren’t true, that will not take responsibility. I had to run as me. I love when people say, “Oh, if only we knew her more, or she were more authentic.” I’ve been around a long time. I am what I am. I care about being absolutely as accurate as possible so people know how to judge what I’m saying. But I think this was not just a slight shift; this was a ground-shaking shift. Because I’m someone who’s observed presidential elections a very long time, and I always saw there would be a moment, maybe one or two, where in a debate or in a really important interview the candidate was asked, “How are you going to do that? Explain to me how that would work.” That was certainly my experience in ’08. I saw my husband go through it — in fact, it probably saved his campaign. I saw, you know, President Obama go through it and be able to say both in ’08 and ’12, look, here’s what we are going to do, and I think this is realistic and we are going to get it done. But it’s going to make a difference. He went from the specific to the upstretched hands of the aspirational promise. Yet it had to be connected to something that was real. And, you know, I’ve been around a long time. I know how hard this is. And I didn’t want to be either not telling the truth about what was going to happen and not being responsible about what I thought we could do and get done together, which I thought could be a pretty big deal. But clearly in a reality TV campaign like the one we were seeing in 2016, it was not the same at all. I never had those moments that I thought would come. EK: So you talk about you are what you are. HRC: I am what I am. EK: You are what you are. And one of the things that was interesting to me in the book was actually how you frame your own history in political organizing. So I’ve read your speech from Wellesley, and it had always sounded like the words of a radical to me. But when you explain about how you thought about running for student body president, you said that “I ran for student government president in 1968 because I thought I could do a good job convincing college administrators to make changes students wanted.” You talk about your work with the Children’s Defense Fund and focus on field work and making reports. This is all in a period when a lot of people around you were interested in upending systems. How did you become more of a pragmatist who wanted to work within the systems in a radical era? HRC: Well, there are always people who want to upend system. And I respect the desire for being part of big change; I think that’s important particularly when younger when you want to see that happen. But I also became convinced early on that in my understanding of change, it was rare that in America you got those huge moments of opportunity. We saw it with President Johnson, with voting rights, civil rights, Medicare, Medicaid, with enormous Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate, so a governing party could actually implement what it chose to pursue. But that’s not that common in American political history. And as I watched what the hard, slow boring of hard boards that Weber talks about meant in our country — it was really digging in, getting to know what you’re talking about, making the case. And sometimes you still ran into an immovable political obstacle, but then you regrouped and you went on again, which is what I did with health care in the 1990s when we ended up with the Children’s Health Insurance Program. So I’m really interested in change, I’m really interested in the principles and the values that I believe America stands for, but I also know what it takes to get where we need to go politically. And that’s what I decided was the most effective way to achieve what I was looking for. EK: This feels to me like the argument that has been at the center of both your ’08 and ’16 candidacies and that you have had trouble making. In both of those elections — in the primary of ’08 and then both in the primary and the general of this year, last year — you ran against people who in some way or another were saying they were going to upend whole system. They were going to bring hope and change, they were going to bring a political revolution, they were going to drain the swamp, whatever it might have been. In those cases you’ve always taken the stance that you actually need to understand the system, you need to work within it, the angels are not going to come down with their violins. And that has been I think simultaneously a realistic and very hard-to-sell message. I had a piece that I had written for if you had won, and it was called “Hillary Clinton’s Political Realism,” and it was about the ways in which your vision of success was much less about upending America’s political system and much more about the change you can bring within it. Why is that such a hard message to sell to the American people? HRC: I don’t think it used to be quite as hard. I think it could be made harder because of the environment in which we find ourselves right now — but you see, I think I’m also very realistic about the forces arrayed against the kind of change I want to see. There’s a big move for change coming from the right that I think would be disastrous for our country. They want radical, pull-em-up-by-the-roots change, they want to have a constitutional convention to rewrite our Constitution to make it friendlier to business, to inject religious and ideological elements. So talk about radical change — they are pursuing it, they are funding it, and they are electing people who are either true believers or willing vehicles for it. So what do we do on the other side? Because we don’t control media the same way the right does; it’s harder for our message to get out. So it’s okay to say all right, let’s really work for change, but you’re going to have to build an edifice under that that has the kind of hard-fought political realities that are going to be necessary to stand against the right. I thought and obviously came close — won the popular vote and all of that — but I thought at end of day, people would say, look, we do want change, and we want the right kind of change, and we want change that is realistic and is going to make difference in my life and my family’s life and my paycheck. That’s what I was offering. And I didn’t in any way want to feed into this not just radical political argument that was being made on other side but a very negative cultural argument about who we are as Americans. So there was so much happening in this campaign and a lot of it for the first time — some of it as a result of long trends — that I was running just trying to figure out, okay, people are really that anti-immigrant? Are they really, or is that just a convenient excuse to rally a base? How far does that really go? It was a tough terrain that we were moving through and trying to understand. EK: This is something I think about in my own writing. Is it possible to be too realistic about the forces arrayed against change, about the institutional constraints against change in the American political system — so realistic that you miss openings, so realistic that it’s hard to inspire people? And as such, it actually begins driving the outcomes themselves. I feel like this is the critique of this kind of politics. HRC: I think it’s a fair critique. I understand that critique. But I don’t think the press did their job in this election, with very few exceptions. So the hard questions about what was real, what was realistic, and what could happen with the right kind of election outcome were never really joined. And so I found it frustrating obviously because I think I could’ve defended and lifted up a lot of what I believed we could do. But really, Ezra, when you get 32 minutes in a whole year to cover all policy, how does that work? Compare it even with ’08, when you had 200 minutes on broadcast TV — you think, well, is it that people are really not interested, or is it that it’s just not as enticing to the press because the other guy’s running a reality TV show, which is hard to turn away from. And whatever we says we think is kind of goofy, but hey, it’s good TV, and she’s over there saying here’s how we’re going to raise taxes on wealthy and here’s what we’re going to do to close loopholes and here’s where I think I can do it, and you know what, she’s going to win anyway. So let’s cover other guy ’cause he’s a lot more fun. And I think, in addition to everything you say, which is fair and needs to be considered, it was such a difficult environment even to have that conversation, so who could tell what was or was not realistic? It was kind of all bets were off in the coverage of the campaign. EK: So Democrats are going to face a question like this as we speak. So right now in Washington, we’re interviewing Sanders — another one of my reporters is — who is proposing his single-payer bill this week. And a lot of Senate Democrats are expected to sign on to the bill. This bill would be quite sweeping; it would upend every insurance arrangement, every private insurance arrangement, in America. Do you think that the Democratic party should sign on, even aspirationally, to a bill that is that radical in its vision? HRC: Well, I don’t know what the particulars are. As you might remember, during the campaign he introduced a single-payer bill every year he was in Congress — and when somebody finally read it, he couldn’t explain it and couldn’t really tell people how much it was gonna cost. So I haven’t seen whatever it is they’re gonna be introducing and signing on to, so I don’t know. I’m for universal health care coverage that is high-quality and affordable for every American. And I think there’s a lot of ways of getting there that I’ve advocated for, to open up Medicare, to open up Medicaid, to do more on prescription drug costs, to really make sure we get costs down and we do everything we can to sort of break the stranglehold that a lot of the pharmaceutical companies, which are unfortunately still driving prices, have on health care costs. And I think it’s going to be challenging if within that bill, there are tax increases equivalent to what it would take to pay for single-payer, and if you’re really telling people — about half of the country — that they can no longer have the policies they have through employer. I’ve been down this road! This is not the first time we’ve tried to confront this. When I was working on health care back in in ’93 and ’94, if we could’ve waved the magic wand and started all over, I said it numerous times, maybe we would start with something resembling single-payer plus other payers, like other countries that have universal coverage and are much better at controlling costs than we do, primarily in Europe. But we were facing the reality — talk about reality — of not just strong, powerful forces but people’s own fears as well as their appreciation for what they already had. So when the bill is actually introduced, I’ll read it, I’ll look at it, but if it doesn’t have some kind of grandfathering in, if it doesn’t have some kind of cost estimate — because look at what happened in Vermont. It wasn’t for lack of trying in Vermont. The Democratic political establishment was behind single-payer, and they worked for years to achieve it. This is in, you know, a small state, where it might’ve been possible. They were talking about an increase in the payroll tax of 9.5 percent, or I think, no, maybe 11.5 percent, they were talking about a sliding income scale, they went up to 9.5 percent — it just was so difficult to put pieces together. Now, clearly if you had a national plan, that would be more likely to avoid state-by-state comparisons, but I think it’s gonna be a big challenge. Our goal should be universal health care coverage — universal, affordable, quality health care coverage for everybody, bar none. EK: Let me ask you about the other side, about Obamacare — which seems, for the moment, to have withstood the attacks on it — but that was a policy that was really built with an eye toward realism. An eye toward what could pass, but also an eye toward how could you overlay something on the existing system that wouldn’t disrupt too many of the existing arrangements. And those pieces of the plan — the exchanges, the private insurers — have been the most substantively difficult to implement and to defend, and then also the most politically difficult. It’s left the administration, first Obama and now Trump, at the mercy of private insurers deciding whether or not to sell, with premium increases they can’t defend, and what has really ended up being popular in that and defensible in that is the Medicaid expansion. Is that a place where Democrats overread what realism required and ended up in a position where what they had wasn’t that inspiring and wasn’t, in the end, that easy to either implement or sustain? I think you have to unpack what you just asked, because even embedded in it was your reference to Medicaid. It was really unfortunate that because of the drafting of the bill, it gave the Supreme Court the opening to eliminate the Medicaid requirement, the expansion requirement. But what has happened is that Medicaid has become very popular even in Republican states because it does save money and it is a universal program below a certain income level, and it takes care of middle-income people when it comes to nursing homes and disabilities and all the rest. So I think we should be focused politically, realistically, and aspirationally on expanding, continuing the expansion of Medicaid, and going to those states that have not yet expanded it. And making the political case every day for as long as it takes. I was in favor of a Medicare buy-in; if you start slowly moving the age down, it would make a very big difference. People’s health begins to have more problems after 55, so let’s get Medicaid down to 60 and then maybe down to 55. I am in favor of a public option, and the Democrats thought they were going to get a public option and at the very end didn’t have votes for reasons that I think were inexcusable at the time. But that was just the fact. You know, you gotta pass it. So is that realism or aspiration? Well, at the end of the day it’s votes. And it didn’t pass. So there are pieces that became less popular partly because of a really well-funded, nonstop campaign against it. But then all of a sudden, with all this talk about repeal and replace — which was just nonsense; they never had a plan to replace, it was just a political talking point, and I don’t think Democrats did a good enough job defending it against those attacks — so when it came time to take something away that people had gotten used to, everybody said no. And that’s my larger point about what our goal really is. You’re going to tell 50 percent of America, “You are no longer to have your employer-based health care, but oh, trust us, it’s going to be really good when we finally work out all the kinks” -- you’re going to have massive resistance by people, who are gonna say, “I’m happy with what I’ve got.” But if you say, “You know what, we need to lower age for Medicare, and here’s how we can do that, and we need to continue the expansion of Medicaid,” we will be at universal coverage. Then once we’re at universal coverage, and people know what that feels like, then can begin to say, “Okay, here’s what we’re going to do to make it work better, to get the costs down.” I think that’s — you know, I think that’s not just realistic, I think it’s thrilling. You know, as somebody who was one of the main advocates for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, I see the difference it’s made in people’s lives. And all through the campaign, people would come up to me and say, “I was on that program,” or, “My family wouldn’t have been able to afford my sister’s care if it hadn’t been for that” — I find that exhilarating because that, to me, is what public service is supposed to be about. The Children’s Health Insurance Program is set to expire at end of this month — what are the forces going to be that will say no, you’re not going to take this away from 8, 9 million kids, where are they gonna go? So what I think is really motivating about being in politics in public service is you can actually see the positive changes, whether it’s civil rights or economics or health care or whatever it might be — and I think at the end of the day, that’s more important than, you know, how realistic was it or aspirational was it. EK: So one of the pieces of the book that really outlined, I think, the disagreement between you and some of the public is right around here. So we’re talking here about the practice of politics, what is realistic, what isn’t, but there’s a real feeling among a lot of folks that the long-term practice of mainstream politics is itself a corrupting exercise. And I think back to 2008, I was at [something] when you were there for a debate with the other Democratic candidates, and there was this really interesting exchange about lobbyists. And you defended them as part of the political system: They have a role to play. The represent people you don’t like but also people you do like. There’s a version of that in your defense of the speeches, in which you sort of say, looked bad, shouldn’t have done it, but you see it as somewhat ridiculous — the idea that Goldman Sachs paying you could have changed what you think. This to me feels like an actually pretty central fault line in our politics now, the feeling that a lot of the public has that if you’ve been in politics a long time, in mainstream politics, that you’ve probably gone a little bit bad from it. And Barack Obama coming in as an outsider in 08, Donald Trump as an outsider, Bernie Sanders, who had held back from a lot of the political system during his career in Washington — that seemed to be a place where there was a lot of friction. How do you think about politics versus this anti-politics sentiment? HRC: Look, anti-politics is part of the American DNA — it goes back to the very beginning. I have no doubt that it’s just built into America’s skepticism and disdain for the people in politics. So that’s just part of the background of being in politics. But I think it’s important to again try to recognize what’s real and what’s not. You know, I can’t help it; I’m like the Velveteen Rabbit. I believe in reality. I like living in a reality-based world. I don’t like alternative facts, I don’t like the very concerted, well-funded effort to try to distort news. I don’t like any of that. I think a democracy like ours depends upon trying to have a vigorous, fact-based debate. So: Nobody on the Republican side cares about any of these issues, Ezra; you know that. I voted for McCain-Feingold; I said in my campaign one of the first things I would do is introduce a constitutional amendment to repeal Citizens United. So I take a back seat to nobody in standing up for sensible, hard-hitting campaign finance rules. But everybody’s got politics. You know, I go after Bernie really hard on the NRA — that’s politics for him. And the idea that he’s set off from politics — he’s been in politics his whole adult life. Donald Trump wasn’t in politics, but he was somebody who funded people on both sides to in order to curry favors. Until we get to public financing, which I wholeheartedly endorse, and we have this crazy system where you have to go out and raise the money — we don’t have a party structure that funds campaigns, we don’t have public financing — then if Democrats unilaterally disarm and say, “You know, we’re holier than Caesar’s wife, and we won’t say or do anything that might raise a question” — there is no compunction on the other side. And there is such an imbalance right now in our politics, in the amount of money that’s on the other side — the Koch brothers say they’re gonna spend $400 million in the 2018 campaign — so yeah, I think, you know, people have to be willing to say, okay, I understand how this might look, it’s not really how I felt or how I acted, but okay, I understand that, so let’s agree on that. But at the end of day, it is very much an unbalanced political environment right now between the resources that are behind Republicans and their campaigns — because it’s not just a straight line between who gave you money, it’s all the rest of the operation — and what stands behind Democrats. And you know if we don’t care about that, then fine, but I don’t think that’s gonna come out very well for us. EK: But in terms of demonstrating that kind of purity, isn’t there a dimension here where Republicans who do not have a very high opinion of the government do not mind particularly the feeling that the government is corrupt, that it does not work on their behalf, that it might even work on behalf of special interests — that that is not actually a threat to their particular version of politics? Whereas for Democrats, who do want people to trust the government, who do want people to have faith in public institutions, there is a higher bar. HRC: Yeah, and I think Democrats by and large try to reach it. I mean, Barack Obama took more money from Wall Street in 08 than any other Democrat has ever taken, and turned around and imposed the toughest regulations under Dodd-Frank since the Great Depression. I tell people that all the time — if you give me money, you will know, because I will tell you publicly and privately what I’m for. So if you’re in a high income tax bracket, I wanna tax you. If you still want to give me money, you are going in with your eyes open. I think it’s theoretically an interesting conversation, but you look at somebody like President Obama, who inherited this disastrous economy and, you know, I think did an incredible job pulling it back out of the abyss — took a lot of money from a lot of different interests, but it didn’t affect how he governed. And so let’s get to the second level here. EK: I do think that’s strong, though, that it didn’t affect how he governed. HRC: Right. EK: I think a lot of President Obama’s policies were pretty sound, but also a lot of people feel he could’ve done more to punish bankers, that he could’ve gone further on health care, there were deals cut before the fact with the pharmaceutical industry, with the insurance industry. And there are other political realism considerations in all these questions, but one thing here is that it’s true, I think, directionally what you’re saying, that a lot of these cut against the interests who funded him. But what a lot of people feel and what I think there is evidence for is that these kinds of donations, etc., they do give people more of a voice, they do give these interests more of a voice, and that does affect things certainly on the margins, certainly in the details. HRC: Well, but, you know, it’s always been thus. I mean, if you’ve seen the musical Hamilton, you know, if you’re running a raucous — EK: — I actually haven’t gotten tickets to that. HRC: — well, we’ll see if we can help you on that. If you’re running a raucous, pluralistic, diverse democracy where there are literally millions of different voices, you are going to hear from all kind of voices. I was a senator for eight years -- I bet the vast majority of people who came through the doors of my Senate office to talk to me, to advocate, whatever they were doing, were not political donors or certainly not political donors to me. They were constituents, they were citizens, they had something to say. So part of what -- we’ve shrunk the political process to such a narrow set of questions, and that’s in the interests of both the far right and the far left, both of whom want to blow up system and undermine it and all the rest of the stuff they talk about. I think we operate better when we’re kind of between center right and center left, because that’s where at least up until recently, maybe it’s changed now -- until recently, that’s where most American were. Look, they didn’t get up every day obsessed with what the government and politics was going to do -- they wanted to know what were the results and is it going to make a difference to my life. And I thought we had a pretty good balance, but I again will argue that this has gone on for decades. The right has been on a mission to disrupt and overturn the political system to the benefit of their commercial, ideological, and partisan interests. I don’t see how you can argue with that. And it has been pretty effective, all said. Their gerrymandering, their suppression of votes — they have a clear agenda, and it’s fascinating that Trump wasn’t really particularly interested in any of this but he was, it turned out to be, a great vehicle for them to promote these interests. So we’re watching the internal debate within their party play out. On our side, you know, I just disagree. I was in that Senate for eight years, I know how hard it is to get to 60 votes. Now, you can say we shouldn’t have to get to 60 votes, but the fact is whether you’re in the majority of in the minority, and I’ve been in both, that has been the rule: Get to 60 votes. Because that then demonstrates at least a broader cross section of representative Americans being in favor of something. So when you talk about bankers, if you look at the laws we had at the time, maybe more could’ve been done, but I’ve heard very credible, very tough people say not really because of the burden of proof and the evidence. I’m not defending it; I’m just saying it’s not for lack of trying that a lot of things were not undertaken. There were barriers to trying that had to be knocked down and changed. And the same with Dodd-Frank. I mean, if Dodd-Frank had been in effect before the crash, more could have been done, but it wasn’t. It had to come after. EK: So I want to talk and move us a little bit to the 2016 election and what happened. HRC: What Happened. EK: The subject of the book. HRC: My book, yes. EK: There’s a premise that is not really articulated one way or the other in the book, and I wanted to see where you fell on it. Was Donald Trump more or less a normal Republican candidate who 1) should have expected to begin with 40-42 percent of the vote? And so you’re just explaining how did a Republican candidate win the election? Or is Donald Trump an abnormal candidate who you should have expected to begin with 30-35 percent of the vote, and so you have to have this very large, explanatory lead as to how he came close enough to actually win? What are you explaining? HRC: I think given the hyperpartisanship in the country right now, once he became the Republican nominee, the odds were very high that Republicans would come home to him as their nominee. Because regardless of what he said or how he behaved or what came out about him, he was their path to tax cuts, he was their path to a Supreme Court seat. There is an agenda on the other side that really does motivate the right. So at the end of the day, I think something like 90 percent of Republicans voted for him and 90 percent of Democrats voted for me. That’s unfortunate in lots of ways — I wish we weren’t in such a hyperpartisan political era — but that’s what I always expected. I always thought the election would be close. I never was one of those people who said, oh, my gosh, he’s so unacceptable and this, that. I always thought it would be close. I didn’t expect to be totally ambushed at the end, which is what I believe, and obviously have written about it, cost me the election — but I always thought it would be close. It’s not like there was going to be some wholehearted rejection of Trump by Republicans who frankly thought they could handle him. They thought, you know what, it’ll be an entertaining four years, and you know, Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell will take care of everything for us. I mean, that was the thinking that I believe went into a lot of the Republicans’ — some of whom sort of took a deep breath before they did it — but they didn’t take him seriously, they didn’t take a potential presidency seriously. They thought getting a Republican in there, that’s going to deliver for these things that I care about. EK: But that’s a kind of remarkable view of politics. It’s actually one that I share, but it’s still a remarkable one, to imagine that we are now in a time, for reasons related to polarization and other things we talked about, that anybody — anybody — who wins a party primary, and parties no longer have control over their primaries — anybody who wins a party primary begins within spitting distance of winning the presidential election. HRC: I believe that. EK: Does that mean we’re more vulnerable to demagogues, to authoritarians, to dangerous candidates than we were in the past? HRC: Yes, we are, Ezra. I mean, if I’d lost to what I guess we could call a normal Republican — one of the other 16 people on the stage during their primary — EK: Jim Gilmore. HRC: Well, somebody that might have been able to win. Look, I would have been disappointed, I would have been upset and heartbroken, but — first of all, I don’t think it would’ve happened, but secondly, if it had happened, I wouldn’t feel such a sense of anxiety about the country. EK: I’m sorry, can I stop you there? HRC: Yeah. EK: That was interesting, what you just said. Do you think that Donald Trump was a stronger candidate than the other Republicans? HRC: Yes. EK: You would have beat the others, but you didn’t beat him? HRC: Well, I don’t want to speculate like that, but I think the fact he emerged, and the way he emerged, which was so unlike anybody ever getting a nomination in recent times, demonstrated the strength he had, which was really rooted in a very cynical assessment of how he could build a Republican majority. He started on the very first day saying terrible things about Mexican immigrants — you know, that they’re rapists and criminals — and all of a sudden, people in the Republican side of the electorate began to say, “Oh, somebody’s speaking to me.” And then he went on from there. And all of his dog whistles and all of his appeals began to coalesce in the primary, and then once he won the nomination, he had some additional advantages like Russian help and sophisticated data analytics operation, weaponizing information, all of that. But his core base — and he was right when he said, “I could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and my supporters won’t leave me” — because he was, in a visceral way, feeding into their prejudice and paranoia. EK: So then that’s an argument — because I want to make sure I try to understand you here — that’s an argument that Donald Trump was stronger than other Republican candidates because he was willing to play white resentment politics in a way that others weren’t. Is that a fair reading of what you just said? HRC: I think that’s part of his appeal, yes. And he was willing to play, let’s not forget, Islamophobic politics, homophobic politics, sexist politics — I mean, hit hit every single area of resentment and grievance that people were feeling. And his racism, which was endemic to his campaign, wasn’t subtle at all. And there’s now been so much analysis done since the election demonstrating clearly that so-called cultural/racial anxiety and prejudice was the primary driver for a lot of his support. EK: But one way of reading the election results is that Donald Trump, through these appeals, was able to get white voters to act as an interest group, to coalesce them in a way they had not recently been coalesced, to motivate them, particularly downscale whites, in a way they had not recently been motivated. That didn’t happen as much with women voters. You talked about watching the Women’s Marches after the election — where was this solidarity during the campaign? Where was this outrage during the campaign? Why do you think that politics worked for Trump but you didn’t see a corresponding surge, particularly among female voters? HRC: Well, let’s start with this fact, though: I did carry the women’s vote. EK: You did carry the women’s vote. HRC: Right. I lost the white women’s vote, but I actually got more white women votes than Barack Obama got. So this was part of a trend. EK; In 2008? HRC: I can’t remember if it was ’08 or ’12. Yeah. And so white voters have been fleeing the Democratic Party ever since Lyndon Johnson predicted they would. There is no surprise to that. Of course I hoped I could get more than a traditional Democratic nominee did because I was the first woman with the chance to be president — but gender is not the motivating factor that race was for President Obama. And so many women — and let’s talk about white women, because that’s the group of women that I lost — are really quite politically dependent on their view of their own security and their own position in society, what works and doesn’t work for them. So as I say in the book, I had this really revealing conversation with Sheryl Sandberg before the campaign. And she’s immersed herself in every bit of research about how do women think and what do they expect. And she said look — and we’re talking predominantly about white women — okay, she said the research is really clear: The more professionally successful a man becomes, the more likable he becomes. The more professionally successful a woman becomes, the less likable she becomes. When a woman is advocating on behalf of others, or working for someone and working hard for that person, the way I did as secretary of state when I was so popular in the public opinion polls, that is favorably received by people. But when a woman advocates for herself — so if I go and say to Vox, I think Ezra deserves a raise, people say, Boy is she a good person. I mean, she’s out there advocating for Ezra. If I go and I say, you know, I think I’m working really hard and I think I deserve a raise, it’s like wow, what got into her? What’s the deal? So Sheryl ended describing all this to me by saying remember, they will have no empathy for you. Now, I believe absent Comey, I might’ve picked up 1 or 2 points among white women. I’ll give you the example I used in the book. Before the Comey letter on October 28, I was 26 points ahead in the Philadelphia suburbs. That could’ve only happened if I had a big vote from women, Republican women, independent women. A week later, 11 days later, I win the Philadelphia suburbs by 13 points. I needed to win by 18 points to be able to counterbalance the rest of the state. That wasn’t just me; that’s how Democrats win Pennsylvania in presidential campaigns. It stopped my momentum, and it hurt me, particularly among women. And I have so much anecdotal evidence for this, and now researchers are starting to pull some of this together. You know, all of a sudden the husband turns to the wife: I told you, she’s going to be in jail, you don’t wanna waste your vote. You know, the boyfriend turns to the girlfriend and says, She’s going to get locked up! Don’t you hear? She’s going to get locked up. All of a sudden it becomes a very fraught kind of conflictual experience. And so instead of saying I’m taking a chance, I’m going to vote, it didn’t work. So I think that there is a lot of work still to be done to try to appeal to as broad an electorate as possible, but not by sacrificing the constituents we have who have stuck with us who are part of a majority if they aren’t suppressed and if they can be motivated to turn out. And I hope that happens in 2018. EK: The premise of a lot of these conversations — you would imagine what we’re talking about is persuasion. You imagine we’re talking about how do a candidate, you in this case, get the most votes? But in this case, you did. And one broader question that you don’t really take on in the book, but since the turn of the millennium, 40 percent of the presidential elections have seen the popular vote won by Democrats and seen the result overturned in the Electoral College. HRC: That’s right. Which is just crazy in these days. EK: Do Democrats have a democracy problem? HRC: No, we have an Electoral College problem. EK: Should there be an Electoral College? HRC: As far back as 2000, I’ve said no. I think it’s an anachronism. I won in counties that produce two-thirds of the economic output in the United States; I won in places that were more on the optimistic side of the scale than the pessimistic side. I won in places that understood and appreciated diversity. I won in places where African-American and younger voters were not suppressed, as they successfully were in, for example, Wisconsin and other locations that I didn’t win. So I think you have to take this and pick it apart. If you come with just one answer, it’s not going to give you what you need to go forward. But at the end of day, if you look at what where we are right now, if we don’t convince — and when I say “we,” it’s the great big Democratic we, not me — but if we don’t convince people to register to vote and vote, the simplest exercise of your citizenship in our country, in the 2018 election, then I really do think we’re going to see the clear and present danger to our democracy that I’ve been talking about come to fruition. We will see a constitutional convention. Now, whether it ever finally gets ratified, I’m not sure, but so it will be so divisive and it will rile up so much of our population, we will see the continuing efforts on the right to disenfranchise people, to roll back regulations that are good for our health and our environment and so much else, we will not recognize America. So part of the reason I wrote this book was not just to say okay, there’s a lot of theories floating around, here’s what I think happened, and I’ve got evidence behind what I say, and I hope you’ll pay attention because if we don’t, what happened to me will continue to happen, and I don’t want to see that in America. EK: But one question about that is actually where the geography of that is going. You talked about winning more of the economic output, probably more than any Democrat has before — HRC: Yeah, probably. EK: But part of that is that Democrats are clustering in urban centers, they’re clustering in big states, and the American political system is not built to advantage that; it’s built to disadvantage that. It seems to me that the Democratic Party could be in a position where it’s winning a lot of moral victories. HRC: No, I’m not interested in that alone. I mean, obviously if we don’t win elections, we don’t win. But there are pieces of this you can address, Ezra. Let’s start with voter suppression, which is one of the five reasons why I believe I lost. Compare Wisconsin to Illinois or Wisconsin to Minnesota — Wisconsin has had a concerted voter suppression campaign going on under Scott Walker and the Republicans. The AP says maybe 200,000 people were turned away. Illinois has had none of that. In fact, they’ve made it easier to vote. Minnesota is an easier-to-vote state. I won both of those. You’ve had voter suppression in Michigan. You’ve had voter suppression in Pennsylvania. Now, that is not about me. That is about what’s right and decent and constitutional. And I was shocked when the Supreme Court threw out the guts of the Voting Rights Act. I was in the Senate, I voted for it, we voted 98 to nothing, George W. Bush signed it, and along comes the Republican majority on the Supreme Court and they throw it out, and Republican governors and legislators could not have been more gleeful. Now, that is not a big-ticket item. That is hard work. We need to elect legislators, we need to elect secretaries of state, we need to bring court cases, because if we don’t deal with this voter suppression, yeah, the electorate will continue to shrink. And it won’t just be the Electoral College; it will be within these states. A shrinkage of the legitimacy of our constitutional democracy. So I care passionately about this because this will determine what kind of country we have for my grandchildren. And so I’m going to be out there day in and day out trying to do what I can to support efforts to give back voting to people, whoever they are, across our country, so that their voices can be heard and we have a democracy that really functions right. EK: Hillary Clinton, thank you very much. HRC: Thank you. "
91,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,GaYhcgwsfgg,"I was twenty-four years old when I started working at the police department as a Muslim Chaplain. and the uniform in it of itself, just commands a lot of respect. Everyone's calling you ""Sir"". You have men who are twice your age who stop everything to salute you. There was times I walked into the bathroom, guys are standing at urinals, they would turn around and salute me. I'm like, ""guys don’t do that."" [Laughs] But that's because I'm in a uniform, right? I still have the realities of not in a uniform. Where I get pulled over and asked, you know, ""do I actually own my car, did I steal my car?"" When I engage in conversation and I show my police credentials, I show my badge, the tenor changes quite drastically. Announcer: ""He is the University Chaplain for NYU, Executive Director of the Islamic Center here... as well as chaplain for the New York City Police Department."" Announcer: ""Working tirelessly to foster dialogue with people of others faiths in order to clarify misconceptions and encourage mutual education."" One day, I was asleep in my bed, one of my friends was staying over. He came into my room and he said ""Hey, the FBI is here."" Two agents came into my living room, I got them seated and I said, you know, ""What is it that you really want from me?"" And they said, ""look.... you're just too good to be true, and we want you to know that we're watching you."" When I land on international flights, you know, the announcement would go off, ""TSA is doing random checks, have your passports ready."" Essentially, I was the random check. They'd then take me, escorted to a detaining room. I've seen women who are as old as my grandmother in detaining rooms being railed into by people because they can't speak English so well while their thirteen year old grandsons are sitting and watching. When they would go through my belongs and they'd find my police credentials. If I was traveling on behalf of the State department. they'd find my State department paperwork. You know, folders with big golden eagles embossed on them. They'd start asking me “You know why are we stopping you?” and I'd say to them “Why do you think you're stopping me?” they said “Look man you’re, young and you’re male and you're muslim and those things don't go so well together right now.” I've sat down with people like Pope Francis, the Dalai Lama, I've met with President Obama on multiple occasions, his senior staff. And these are the kinds of things that happen to people like me, with those connections. You got to really think what's happening with people who don't have those connections And what their lives are like day to day. When my wife and I went to St. Lucia for our honeymoon, I said to her “don't get off the plane with me, you don't wanna go through this” And she said “No, you're my husband you know I'm going to walk with you through everything” And we got to the doorway there was nobody there, We got to the baggage claim and I took my suitcases, we left the baggage claim. We're standing in the outside part of the airport. I hadn't seen that part of an airport in about six years. My wife starts joking around and she says to me “You should've gotten married to me much sooner, maybe you wouldn't have the problems you had before” And I responded by putting my head on her shoulder and just crying. The deeply entrenched racisms that exist in our country have to be addressed and they have to be addressed not for the sake of any singular minority population. But really for the sake of all of us just as human beings. I really believe that things can change. "
92,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,GxIDJWCbk6I,"Every few years, they gather to tell us what's happening to our warming planet. In 2018, they had some news. ""It’s very clear that half a degree matters."" This is a chart of how much the global temperature has gone up since we discovered fossil fuels. For a long time, scientists said that we should try to stay under this line: 1.5 degrees celsius. But that really, we’d be okay if we ended up below this line: 2 degrees. Now they were saying, that wasn't quite right. That we’re not safe in this zone. And that hitting this line will mean a spike in mass migration, wildfires, deadly heat stress - and it’s going to cost us. ""Trillions of dollars, millions of lives. Irreversible, forever. Changes that cannot be undone in centuries."" That’s what happens if we get warming to stop here. And right now, we're on track to go way past that. “If action is not taken, it will take the planet into an unprecedented climate future, if we compare it to what has happened during all of human evolutionary history.” We don’t have a plan for this. So a group of American activists started to make one. They recruited a Congresswoman and a senator to turn it into a Congressional resolution. It’s the first step of a plan that has mostly yet to be written. It’s called the Green New Deal. And inside, there’s something we might not want to hear. This is the Green New Deal resolution. It’s only 14 pages. And to understand what's in it, it's important to understand what's not. ""It is not a bill. It's not legislation. It's not a policy proposal. It's not anything that you could pass and make law."" This is my colleague David Roberts. Dave's written a lot about the Green New Deal. And he says the 14-page resolution is just a first step. ""The idea was, what's our shared understanding of the problem, and what's necessary to solve it?"" The Green New Deal contains basically two big ideas. The first is this question of what we need to do to solve the impending climate crisis. The Green New Deal says what climate scientists say: We need to completely stop burning fossil fuels — ""as much as technologically feasible."" ""So that means things like rethinking vehicles, energy efficiency standards for buildings, changing the ways we make steel and concrete."" That's Rhiana Gunn-Wright. She’s part of the think tank that came up with the Green New Deal. ""Policy director at New Consensus."" Rhiana writes policy. And she likes to rattle off the things that moving away from fossil fuels will entail. ""Moving to electric vehicles. Make that home energy efficient. The food that you buy will be grown locally."" The Green New Deal requires building a lot of new things, the things to power the world, without fossil fuels. And that’ll create new jobs, new industries, an entire new economy. But Rhiana also emphasizes that this is going to inflict a cost. ""It's going to be a massive undertaking, because we're asking how do we rethink the ways we use energy in our society."" A key principle of the Green New Deal is that it’s too late to incrementally move away from fossil fuels. It has to happen quickly, and dramatically. Or as Dave puts it: ""People don't seem to get, zero emissions means zero oil business, zero natural gas business. No coal business, no internal combustion engine auto business. The number ""zero"" means it all has to go."""" Here’s what decarbonizing will do. When we rip out fossil fuels from the economy, people are going to lose their jobs. And that means they’ll lose their health care and maybe their homes. But the Green New Deal also has a second part. And this part acknowledges that transitioning Americans away from fossil fuels is a huge and difficult ask -- especially at a time when so many live in economic uncertainty. ""How can we go to the American people and say  'I sure hope you aren't one of the people who loses a job, because then you might die, sick on the street. Good luck. Now will you sign my bill?'"" This is the contradiction that the Green New Deal describes. It's the part we may not want to hear: That we need to take action, and also that taking action will cause pain. Imagine you’re a coal worker. If the US decarbonizes, you are going to suffer. So this second part is a set of promises, for how Americans will be protected during the transition away from fossil fuels. ""Jobs guarantee, public employment, universal healthcare, education and training."" ""The basic elements of economic freedom that ought to be promised and due to every citizen of the richest country in the world."" And these promises aren't just for protecting coal workers. They're meant to keep all inequality from getting even worse during the transition. Because think about what direction wealth, and power, usually flow in — when new things get built. It's the communities with the most political clout who decide where things can and can't be built. Wealthy corporations jump in to build those projects. And the good jobs go to people who can afford to get trained for them. ""The folks who have the fewest barriers will be the ones who benefit the most, and you're just going to see a replication of the issues that we have now."" In other words, anyone who’s historically missed out on those benefits -- especially the poor, and people of color -- could end up even worse off. So the Green New Deal says, we should rebuild the American economy -- in a way that allows opportunity to flow more fairly. ""The Green New Deal is about: While we have this chance, why don't we think about that proactively to change it in the ways that people have been calling for it to be changed for generations at this point."" So the first part of the Green New Deal is a set of goals to avoid a global disaster. The second part says we should do it in a way that helps ordinary Americans come out better on the other side. And that's it. That’s all that's in these 14 pages. It’s just a first step. And now, Rhiana’s job is to figure out how to go from this 14-page resolution to an actual Green New Deal - a road map for what government needs to do next. And their goal is that, if Democrats win power in 2020, there’s a plan ready to execute. For now, though, the Green New Deal is just asking our leaders to acknowledge the scale of the problems we face. ""This disastrous plan …"" ""... would be a massive government takeover…"" ""...  it would stifle innovation…"" ""... wasteful and reckless spending..."" ""... rather than setting realistic goals… "" ""... we would go from about 94 million cows to zero cows..."" ""... that resolution will not pass the Senate. Because there's no way to pay for it..."" ""Desctructive, socialist, daydream."" The Green New Deal is a longshot. But right now it’s also the only plan that acknowledges what we know is coming. ""What is the world that we want? What is the country that we want? And how do we get there? And how do we get there in a way that is just, and how do we get there in a way that stabilizes the climate and heals our planet? Because if we don't do that, then there will be no paradigm because there will be nothing to fight for."" "
93,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,H76e8yIbXi4,"More Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than for Donald Trump. More Americans voted for Democratic Senate candidates than for Republican Senate candidates. And Trump, he's  really unpopular. The most unpopular new president we’ve had since, well, since we invented polling. He’s so unpopular that his inauguration was greeted with the largest single day of protests ever ever in American history. This is a message. It is a message from the voters to him. If Trump were wise, he would govern with some humility. He needs to turn his minority into a majority. And he can do that. He could reach out to the majority of Americans who didn’t vote for him, who don’t approve of him — and show them, in word and deed, with compromise candidates and compromise legislation, that they were wrong about him That he’s better than they thought. That he’ll a president for all Americans. Another round of sweeping immigration changes expected from President Trump, after he signed off on his signature promise, to build a border wall. President Trump will sign an executive order today related to a voter fraud investigation, in the absence of information to suggest there was voter fraud. In his every move since winning the election, Trump has shown he will govern as the most extreme version of himself. He has made Breitbart’s Steve Bannon his chief strategist. He made retired Gen. Michael Flynn his national security adviser. He said that Jeff Sessions will be his attorney general. He’s still sending out tweets attacking John Lewis, He's getting in fights with the CIA. His inauguration address made no effort at all to reach out to the other side...instead he told his own supporters that he’d be here, governing for them. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before. So far, there’s been no effort, at all, to reach out to the other side, or to play against type. There’s no Democrats in his cabinet, as there were Republicans in Barack Obama’s cabinet. Trump won’t even admit he’s unpopular. He just tweets the polls are rigged. So Trump is not going to represent the bulk of Americans, he’s not even apparently going to try. But someone needs to. So far, Democrats have slipped very comfortably into the position of minority party. They aren’t demanding that Trump put forward compromise candidates for key posts. They aren’t laying out a proactive agenda that would serve as their basis for negotiations with Trump and the Republicans. And they aren’t, in their public messaging, emphasizing that most voters opposed Trump’s agenda, and that both Democrats and Republicans need to take that seriously. Democrats have confused being out of power with being in the minority. And that is a mistake. They are out of power, but it's not clear at all that what they represent is a minority. And somebody, somebody needs to represent the majority of voters who do not want to buy Trump is selling. As grim as the situation is for Democrats — and it is grim — it’s not going to take long for Republicans to recognize they're in some trouble too. They’ve lost the popular vote in six of the past seven elections. That has never happened for a political party before. And, remember, it's the out-of-power party that tends to gain seats in midterm elections. All of which leaves an opening for Democrats. If Trump doesn’t intend to represent the majority of the country, well, they can. They don’t hold much power in Congress, but they hold more than Republicans did in 2009, and Republicans were able to cause plenty of problems for Obama’s agenda. They were able to make it very clear that Obama was governing on his own. Democrats should insist, in both appointments and legislation, that Trump govern with some consideration for the majority of Americans who voted for someone else. That is not mindless opposition. That is a reasonable cost for cooperation. Democrats should demand both that the media and Republicans to take seriously the fact that Trump is governing without a majority, or even a plurality, of the American people behind him, and that that carries with it a responsibility to govern modestly. There’s been a lot of talk about “normalizing” Trump, but what's happening here is more fundamental. To ignore the election results, and his poll numbers, and act like the strongest possible version of Trump’s agenda has been endorsed by most voters, it and this is important, it gives Trump license to govern in a way that he shouldn’t. Elections decide who wins power. They don’t decide how it should be wielded. If Trump governs in a way that respects the center of opinion in the country — a center Democrats appear to hold — Democrats should work with him. If he doesn't, then they should keep pointing that out, and force him to govern alone. "
94,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Hd5Qs0fc_I0,"In Sweden, more than 82.6% of people over 18 turn out to vote in elections. 82.6%! In the U.S., just over half the voting age population shows up to the polls. We’re getting our asses kicked by Denmark, South Korea, the Netherlands and a whole host of other developed democracies. If we re-sort this chart to show what percent of registered voters actually voted - we’re near the top of the list! The U.S. has a huge gap between the share of people who can vote, and the share of people who actually do. But it turns out, a lot of these countries are doing something really simple, that could make that gap disappear. If you take all 50 states, and rank them by the share of eligible voters — that’s citizens over 18 who aren’t felons — that actually voted in 2016, you can see a huge variation. Now let’s look at the states that let you register when you show up to vote on election day. Notice something? The states with the highest turnout rates all have it. All the states below the national average— well, they don’t. Most of them make you register nearly a month in advance. And there’s a whole host of reasons people might not be registered - nearly a third of unregistered Americans say they intend to and just haven’t gotten around to it, others say it’s inconvenient or they just don’t know how. In Minnesota, 12% of the people who voted in 2016 registered on election day. That’s 350,000 people. Maine, New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Idaho all had lots of people registering last-minute, too. Oregon has figured that out. Turnout increased nearly 4% from 2012 to 2016 — that's more than double than what we saw nationally. It’s no coincidence that in 2015 Oregon became the first state to enact automatic voter registration - or AVR. Here’s how it works. Anyone who has an interaction with Oregon’s Department of Motor Vehicles is automatically added to the list of registered voters, called a voter roll. The state sends them postcards giving them a chance to register with a party or decline to be registered. It changes the system from opt-in to opt-out. So a sixteen year old getting their driver license will be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18. A new resident who changes their ID or car registration will also be automatically registered In total, 272,000 people were registered this way. And more than a third of them actually voted in 2016. Of those voters, 37% of them were under 30. Compare that to the voters who were registered through the traditional fill-out-the-vote--for method, and only 13% were under 30. AVR got more young people to come out on election day. 13 states and Washington, DC have already passed AVR legislation and will have it running by the 2020 election. It’ll have massive effects in California alone, where there are nearly 7 million eligible people not registered to vote yet. Let’s go back to that chart with all the other countries. These are the ones who have some form of automatic voter registration. If the US implemented it nationally, we could literally move up in the world. Plus, it’ll make our voting system more secure and more accurate. Now when you move, you have to re-register to vote. That creates duplicate registrations and makes it harder for voter rolls to be kept updated. With AVR, your registration moves with you - no duplicates. It’ll also be cheaper. Everything will be electronic and there will be millions less registrations to process. But most importantly, it could automatically register nearly 50 million Americans, who would then gets a chance to help decide how the country should be run. "
95,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Hx7WLlJzrlw,"Here's a scary fact: in 2014 47,000 Americans died from drug overdose. That's a new record. But if you peel back the numbers, many of these Americans are not dying from illegal drugs. The main killer is not cocaine, meth, or heroin. Instead, totally legal opioid painkillers were the biggest cause of overdoses. How did we get to this point? LOPEZ: ""So in the 1990s, doctors were under a lot of pressure from advocacy groups of federal government to treat pain is this really serious medical issue and there was a pretty good reason for that. There were about a hundred million Americans suffering from chronic pain."" NARRATION: ""The undertreatment of pain is a major public health problem whatever the cause, some end up shuttling from doctor to doctor desperate for relief."" Under this pressure, doctors turned to opioid painkillers: highly potent drugs that bind to receptors in the nervous system and reduce pain messaging to the brain. And one reason doctors turned to opioid painkillers is because drug companies like Purdue Pharma said that they were safer and less addictive than other painkillers on the market. DOCTOR: ""We now find that these medicines much so much more powerful much more versatile than we used to think. And we feel that they should be used much more liberally for people with all sorts of chronic pain."" LOPEZ: ""Yeah, that wasn't true at all that these drugs were safer than the other ones on the market and in fact Purdue Pharma ended up paying hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for its false claims later on."" The damage had been done and by 2012, physicians wrote 259,000,000 prescriptions for opioid painkillers, enough to give a bottle of pills to every adult in the country. Since opioid painkillers are so addictive, millions of patients got hooked on the drug. And as use proliferated, many patients overdosed. In 2014, nearly 19,000 drug overdoses linked to opioid painkillers. About 40% of all drug overdoses recorded that year. LOPEZ: ""So yeah, here's where it gets like really ugly. Doctors began pulling back these prescriptions, but what that actually ended up doing is that because these painkiller addicts were already using and addicted to opioids, is that they just went to another opioid: Heroin. People who are addicted to painkillers are 40 times as likely to be addicted to heroin since 2000 heroin overdoses are up by 500% more than 10,000 people died of heroin overdoses just in 2014."" The government is finally responding to this whole problem. The Obama administration, along with local state and private efforts have significantly increased funding for prevention and treatment programs. But fundamentally doctors still need an alternative to treating chronic pain. One option that has gotten surprisingly little attention is another contentious political issue, medical marijuana. LOPEZ: ""The research on pot -- it's still pretty early in large part because they're so many restrictions. The research that has been done suggest pot is actually really good. Not for every chronic pain patient, but for a lot of chronic pain patients. And unlike opioids, pot isn't linked to deadly overdoses. That doesn't mean it's perfectly safe, but it doesn't kill people in the way opioids do."" Studies also show that states with medical marijuana dispensaries tend to have fewer opioid overdose deaths. In the best study done so far the research said that providing broader access to medical marijuana may have the potential benefit of reducing abuse of highly addictive painkillers. LOPEZ: ""I mean I wouldn't say that medical marijuana's like the only option for dealing with opioids. But right now doctors are in a really bad position. They want to treat pain as a serious medical issue. The drugs that they were relying on, opioids, have caused this massive, very urgent crisis, and marijuana it might not be the perfect solution, it won't work for everyone, but at least it's something to go on right now.""

96,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,IIWlatQt4KE,"So I recently took one of those at-home DNA ancestry tests. All I had to do was fill up a vial with a disgusting amount of spit and mail it off for analysis. We're gonna be here for a very long time. I just spit it back up in my nose. A couple weeks later, this is what I got: It's a neat little pie chart with these specific percentages that were color-matched to different regions on a world map. The report told me I was mostly Southwest Asian — no surprises there, considering both my parents are from Iran. That percentage — 86.7% — I understood that to be the portion of my DNA that’s West Asian. But it turns out, that’s not exactly what ancestry tests are telling us at all. This is an ad for one DNA ancestry test, 23 and Me. An ethnically ambiguous woman travels the world, and a circle animates around her, sort of like the pie chart in my test results, as if to say, this woman's DNA is 29% East Asian. And here's an ad for a different ancestry test. “52% of my DNA comes from Scotland and Ireland.” And somehow this information compels him to... wear a kilt? Alright, so what are ancestry tests really telling us? Can you help me understand what my results are telling me? Because I’m getting mixed messages from ads and how other people talk about their results. This is Wendy Roth. I'm an associate professor of Sociology at the University of British Columbia. OK. First of all, these test results are not about your entire DNA. They're about a tiny, tiny fraction of your DNA. To understand how genetic ancestry tests work, let’s start with the DNA itself. There are about 3 billion base pairs in our genetic code. Those are the As, Cs, Ts, and Gs that form the instructions that make us… us. Of these 3 billion base pairs, 99.9% are exactly the same in all humans. But for the remaining .1%, one person might have an adenine where another person has a guanine. These single-letter differences are called Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms or SNPs. Groups of SNPs can help explain why some people are taller than others or why some people have green eyes while others have brown eyes. But most SNPs have no known effect at all. What many DNA tests are looking at are a relatively small number of SNPs, specific positions in this .1% in our DNA, in order to give you your results. When a testing company receives your sample, they compare your pattern of SNPs to different reference populations in their database. These reference populations contain SNPs known to exist more frequently in different modern populations in the world. Then the testing company will give you a percentage that represents how strongly your pattern of SNPs resembles that group. But this process has a bunch of important limitations and this is where things get complicated. Lots of markers are found in multiple populations around the world. First, even trying to classify humans into groups in the first place is tricky. Human genetic diversity isn’t organized neatly into groups like countries or continents. Take a look at the distribution of this SNP that affects how a person absorbs folic acid. It’s commonly found in Mexico, but also in Chile, or even China, just as often. So let's say that a particular marker is found in the South Asian population 30 percent of the time. There's still a possibility that when you inherited this marker you got it not from somebody who was South Asian, but from somebody who was in some completely different group that also happened to have that marker. Second, testing companies put together their reference populations based on academic research and other people that have taken genetic ancestry tests. And most testing companies aren’t clear about how many people are represented in their reference populations. So each company might have different reference databases, which helps explain why you might get different results from different companies. So what does this all mean for my results? This is a probability with a margin of error. So it's not that you overall are eighty-five percent West Asian, but that the particular spot that they happened to look at, eighty-five percent of those locations are associated with Western Asia in their reference population. So what about these other results? Am I really 2 percent African? You've got a lot of, you know, sort of small trace percentages here. Percentages that small are really not meaningful, again because that could be affected by having one person in the database. And if that one person gets reclassified later on because they get a larger sample, that percentage will disappear. Ultimately, DNA ancestry tests are really just giving us a probability, the testing company’s best guess. And that uncertainty isn’t made very clear in the results. Buried in my results I found this “confidence slider.” It turns out, my results were presented at about 50% confidence by default. When I increased it to 90%, my results got much more vague. All of a sudden I was ""broadly"" West Asian and a lot of my genetic markers were unassigned. So, DNA ancestry tests don’t actually tell us where our ancestors lived - they're really just giving us probabilities of where we’re likely to have relatives today. But so what if people misinterpret their results? Well that has consequences. They can make us believe that our ethnicities have these bright-line distinctions between them, like in a pie chart. When people are presented with test results and these percentage breakdowns and they are led to think that these tests can tell you your race or they can tell you who you are, that that leads to a way of thinking — makes us feel that there are very stark and clear biological differences between races. One study found that DNA ancestry tests reinvigorate age-old beliefs in essential racial differences, that our socially constructed racial categories like “white” or “black” are essentially different from each other. Some groups have even turned to genetic ancestry tests to try and prove their “racial purity."" DNA ancestry tests can be useful. Search YouTube and you'll find hundreds of stories of people using them to find lost relatives and fill in their family histories. And, to people who don’t know a lot about their ancestry, the tests offer the best available estimate. But it’s important to remember that, despite their marketing, these tests are just a company’s best guess at matching your genetic markers to different parts of the world. What they’re not going to tell you is whether you should wear a kilt or not. DNA ancestry tests might not be as informative as you want them to be, but more and more people are still taking them. And this giant database of genetic information is becoming super valuable to an unexpected group: Law enforcement. We’ve teamed up with Verge Science, to look into how your privacy is at risk because of genetic ancestry tests, even if you’ve never taken one. "
97,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,IfYRzxeMdGs,"At the edge of Central Park in Manhattan, there's  a bronze statue of a doctor named James Marion Sims. Whose “brilliant achievement carried the fame of American surgery throughout the entire world.” He’s the guy who created the vaginal speculum, an instrument gynecologists use for examination. He pioneered the surgical repair for fistula, a complication from childbirth, And became known as the “father of modern gynecology.” But that brilliant achievement, was the result of a series of excruciating experimental surgeries that he conducted on enslaved women. In a lot of ways, Sims epitomizes the story of American medicine for black women. It’s a system that’s failing them to this day. From&nbsp;infant mortality to life expectancy, the racial disparities in health care are staggering. The gulf between black and white might be widest when we look at maternal mortality. With black women 3 to 4 times more likely to die in connection with pregnancy or birth than white women. And that divide can be traced back to doctors like Sims who contributed to a long, largely overlooked, history of institutional racism in medicine. Trying to understand a historical problem without knowing its history, is like trying to treat a patient without eliciting a thorough medical history. You're doomed to failure. That’s Harriet Washington, a medical ethicist and author who chronicled the intersection of race and medicine in her book, Medical Apartheid. While many of the stark racial disparities in health care can be attributed to environmental and economic factors like access to good health care, studies show that minority patients studies show that minority patients tend to receive a lower quality of care than non-minorities, even when they have the same types of health insurance or the same ability to pay for care. As African-Americans we've been abused for so long consistently by the system. Why should we trust it? Why should we go to when ill? And that's iatrophobia. That's a fear of the healer, you know, inculcated by the behavior of those healers unfortunately. It starts with slavery. Doctors relied on slave owners for financial stability. They accompanied plantation masters to auctions to verify the fitness of slaves, and were called in to treat sick slaves to protect their owners’ investments. In 1807, Congress abolished the importation of slaves, and in turn pushed black women to have more children, to essentially “breed” slaves. Founding father Thomas Jefferson later wrote, Around the 1830s the abolitionist movement led to the rise of what was called “Negro medicine,” or efforts to identify black “inferiority” to justify slavery. And there were polygenists, who tried to use both “science” and the Bible to find proof that races evolved from different origins. The 1830s also marked the beginning of recorded experimentation on black women’s bodies. One doctor performed experimental c-sections on slaves. Another one perfected the dangerous ovariotomy - or removal of an ovary - by testing the procedure on slave women. In fact, half the original articles in the 1836 Southern Medical and Surgical Journal dealt with experiments on black people. And then, of course, there was James Marion Sims, whose reputation is etched in history... and on that statue in Central Park. Between 1845 and 1849, Sims began performing experimental surgeries on a 17-year-old slave named Anarcha. He eventually performed 30 operations on Anarcha, and more surgeries on about 11 other female slaves. When his male colleagues could no longer bear to assist him in inflicting pain on the women, the slaves took turns restraining one another. Yet, paintings depicting Sims, Anarcha, and other slave women, presented a subdued version of his experiments. Even though anesthesia was introduced in 1846, Sims chose not to use it for his experimentation with slaves. His practices echoed one of the most prevalent, and dangerous beliefs in medicine at the time: that black people did not feel pain or anxiety. This book from 1851 titled ""The Natural History of Human Species,"" claimed Studies released as recently as last year demonstrate that black people are less likely to be treated for pain - particularly in the ER. There’s even one from a children’s hospital that found the same to be true for kids. And just this year, Pearson Education, a leading educational publisher, issued an apology and recalled nursing textbooks that included racist stereotypes, like this section that said Well what does it mean when you say that someone doesn't feel pain? Among other things you're speaking about their humanity. These are all part of that suite of beliefs emanating from the 19th century, that we still have not shaken off, despite all our knowledge and sophistication. They're deeply ingrained. Doctors like Sims might fit the “Dr. Frankenstein” stereotype, but they weren’t outliers. Historically, Southern doctors who used black bodies for troubling experiments were the norm. It’s a very common question, how can we judge our forebears? You know those guys in the 18th century who practice medicine in a way that appalls us today and we think, how could you do that? I did not judge the practicioners based on our own ethics. I judge them based on the ethics of their time. It was not acceptable back then, we just did not hear from the people who protested against it. After the Civil War ended, the 1900s brought a wave of immigrants to the US. It sparked a race “panic,” and coincided with the birth of the American eugenics movement. One of the movement’s key objectives was to reduce the childbearing potential of the poor and disabled. Leaders included birth control pioneer and Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger, who eventually devised the controversial “Negro Project,” or family planning centers that pushed birth control in the black South. It was a project that even garnered support from W.E.B DuBois, a founder of the NAACP, who wrote that black people bred “carelessly and disastrously.” By the mid-1930s, more than half the states passed pro-sterilization laws. And often, sterilization was forced. In 1961, future civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer went to the hospital to have a tumor removed, but was subjected to a hysterectomy without consent. The procedure - which rendered women infertile without their knowledge - was so common in the South that Hamer is said to have dubbed it the “Mississippi appendectomy.” African-American babies were no longer economically valuable, And African-Americans themselves had gone from being a resource to a nuisance. In June of 1973, the SPLC uncovered 100,000 to 150,000 cases of women who had been sterilized with federal funds in Alabama. Half the women were black. In recent decades, women of color continue to be exposed to dubious reproductive health programs. In December 1990, the FDA approved a contraceptive called Norplant. And it was selectively marketed to black teenagers in Baltimore schools. Norplant fans like David Duke, the former KKK grand wizard, even introduced legislation to give women on welfare an annual reward of 100 dollars if they agreed to get Norplant. That bill never passed. But the implant ignited a debate on whether long term contraception - like Norplant that lasted five years - could be used as a form of social engineering when pushed on to specific communities. Today, as we continue to lose black mothers at alarming rates, a deeper look at the past may be a good step toward creating a more equitable health care system. Hi guys, thanks for watching. Of course, there's a lot more to the history of how the US medical system has mistreated people of color than we could fit in the video. Everything from the Tuskegee experiments to Jim Crow laws segregating hospitals. But we hope it starts to give some context to the racial disparities we see in medicine today. ProPublica has been reporting on the disparities in maternal mortality in the US, and how it's the most dangerous industrialized country in which to give birth. Check out that feature piece in the link below. And we're seeking your help in understanding the problem. So if you nearly died during pregnancy or you know someone who died due to childbirth related complications, then check out that link in the description. Thanks again! "

I spent my entire last year traveling around to different places making documentaries on the topic of Borders. I'm excited to announce that Borders is back. I'm hitting the road again to go tell the story of some of the most interesting places in the world. We're stuck again. The first location for this next round of Borders is going to be: Hong Kong. I'm doing things a little bit differently this time. Instead of going to these places to focus on one major topic and to make like a 15 minute documentary about that topic, I'm actually gonna be making a lot more videos from these places. I'm gonna stay there a little bit longer and make more videos that are more narrow and a little bit shorter. Wait, so no more sweet documentaries with all the fancy graphics? No, no no no no. That's not what I'm saying. These are still gonna be beautiful, really well produced pieces, they're just gonna be a little bit more narrow in their scope and they're gonna be shorter, but there's gonna be a bunch more of them. Okay, cool. As always I'm looking for your help in finding and reporting these stories. If you live in Hong Kong or Macau or have traveled there or read something interesting about it, I want to hear about it. It doesn't necessarily have to be about conflict or the political situation, it can be about an interesting community or an interesting restaurant or figure or person. I just want to know what's worth explaining about this peculiar part of the world. If you do have some ideas, I want to hear about it. You can go to Facebook or Instagram and DM me. Now if you do live in Hong Kong Macau and you want to meet up with me when I travel there next month or you want to contribute to Borders in some other way, go to: vox.com/borders-local where you can fill out a form telling me a little bit more about yourself and how you'd be willing to contribute to Borders. This could be anything from me asking you to film something on your cell phone that you see every day or filming a part of your life that would be really interesting for these stories. So the last thing I'll say is that we just created this Facebook Watch page, which is a Facebook page basically optimized for viewing videos. That's where I'm going to be posting all the Border's content first, so if you want to kind of subscribe or follow Borders content only, that's the place to go. It's gonna be a lot cleaner than following my personal pages which are usually like, photos of my family. If you want just the Border's content go follow this page and you'll get a notification every time there's some new update or new video that's published. Okay, housekeeping items out of the way. Borders Hongkong is officially in motion. I'm excited to hear what stories you come up with. And yes I plan to wear this orange coat until the day it comes unstitched. "
99,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,JFpanWNgfQY,"Syria's war is mess. After 6 years, the conflict is divided between four sides, each side with foreign backers. And those foreign backers don't even agree with each other on who they are fighting for and who they are fighting against. And now, Syria’s use of chemical weapons has provoked President Donald Trump to directly attack Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. This is a major development, because, up until now, the US has only been focused on fighting ISIS. To understand the criss-crossing interventions and battle lines in Syria today, and how it got this way, it helps to go back to the beginning of the conflict and watch to see how it unfolded. The first shots in the war were fired, in March 2011, by Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad against peaceful Arab Spring demonstrators. In July the protesters start shooting back, and some Syrian troops even defect from the Syrian army to join them. They call themselves the Free Syrian Army and the uprising becomes a civil war. Extremists from around the region and the world start traveling to Syria to join the rebels. Now, Assad actually encourages this by releasing jihadist prisoners to tinge the rebellion with extremism and make it harder for foreign backers to support them. In January 2012, al-Qaeda forms a new branch in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra. Also around that time, Syrian Kurdish groups, who had long sought autonomy, take up arms and informally secede from Assad's rule in the north. That summer is when Syria becomes a proxy war. Iran, Assad's most important ally, intervenes on his behalf. By the end of 2012, Iran is sending daily cargo flights and has hundreds of officers on the ground. At the same time, the oil-rich Arab states on the Persian Gulf begin sending money and weapons to the rebels, mainly to counter Iran’s influence. Iran steps up its influence in turn, in mid-2012 when Hezbollah, a Lebanese militia backed by Iran, invades to fight along Assad. In turn the Gulf States respond, Saudi Arabia really stepping up this time, to send more money and weapons to the rebels, This time through Jordan who also opposes Assad. By 2013, the Middle East is divided between mostly Sunni powers, generally supporting the rebels, and Shias, generally supporting Assad. That April, the Obama administration, horrified by Assad's atrocities and the mounting death toll, signs a secret order authorizing the CIA to train and equip Syrian rebels. But the program stalls. At the same time, the US quietly urges Arab Gulf states to stop funding extremists, but their requests basically go ignored. In August, the Assad regime uses chemical weapons, provoking condemnation around the world Obama: ""Men, women, and children lying in rows – killed by poison gas..."" It is in the national security interests of the United States to respond to the Assad regime's use of chemical weapons through a targeted military strike. Russia proposed on Monday that Syria surrender control over its chemical weapons to the international community for its eventual dismantling, to avoid a US military strike. The US ends up backing down, but the whole thing establishes Syria as a great-powers dispute, with Russia backing Assad and the US opposing him. Just weeks later, the first American CIA training and arms reach Syrian rebels. The US is now a participant in the war. In February 2014, something happens that transforms the war: an al-Qaeda affiliate, based mostly in Iraq, breaks away from the group over internal disagreements. The group calls itself the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, and it becomes al-Qaeda's enemy. ISIS mostly fights not Assad, but other rebels and Kurds, carving out a mini-state it calls its Caliphate. That summer, it marches across Iraq seizing territory, galvanizing the world against it. In September, one year after the US almost bombed Assad, it begins bombing ISIS. Obama: “We're moving ahead with our campaign of airstrikes against these terrorists, and we're prepared to take action against ISIL in Syria as well.” That summer, in July, the Pentagon launches its own program to train Syrian rebels — but will only those who'll fight ISIS, not Assad. The program fizzles, showing that America now opposes ISIS more than Assad, but that there's also no like-minded Syrian proxy forces on the ground in Syria. In August, Turkey starts bombing Kurdish groups in Iraq and in Turkey, even as these Kurdish groups are fight ISIS in Syria. But Turkey doesn't bomb ISIS. This gets to one of the big problems in this conflict: the US sees ISIS as its main enemy, but the US’ allies like Turkey and a lot of other Middle Eastern states have other priorities. This makes for a lot of unclear and confusing alliances. The next month, in September, Russia intervenes on behalf of Assad, sending a few dozen military aircraft to a long-held Russian base in the country. Russia says it's there to bomb ISIS, but in fact only ends up bombing anti-Assad rebels, including some backed by the US. The next year, Donald Trump wins the White House, vowing to stay out of Syria, and signaling that Assad should be able to stay in power. At the end of 2016, Assad, helped by Russian airpower and Iranian sponsored militias, retakes the Syrian city of Aleppo, knocking the rebels out of their last remaining urban stronghold. Then, in Spring 2017, Assad once again uses chemical weapons against his people, killing 85, including 20 children. Back in the US, Trump says his attitude toward Syria and Assad has “changed very much” due to the attacks. He vows to respond and within days the White House launches dozens of tomahawk missiles that strike an airbase in Syria. This is the first time the United States has directly attacked the Assad regime. This adds yet another criss crossing complication to an already multidimensional civil war. So as it stands now, Syria is in ruins. Even as Assad recaptures land, the rebellion perseveres. And with outside countries fueling each of the groups, it’s clear that there is still no end in sight.

100,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,JXRxdgivnic,"This ad isn’t what you think. It’s not promoting a sports team or a grill company. It’s for an apple. And unlike those that have dominated the produce section when you were a kid, new breeds like this one have catchy names, logos, and slogans. And are trying to generate buzz before you can buy them. Historically, our produce has gone unbranded. So how did we end up with all these apples? For most of the past century, America’s iconic apple was that of Snow White. Lipstick red, with shiny skin and a crisp white interior, a.k.a. “the Red Delicious.” First grown on an orchard in Iowa and originally named after its founder, when it came out in the late 1800s, it was dubbed “the best apple of any time” Growers and retail stores loved the Red delicious because it looked good. It was uniform in size and color, turned red before it was ripe, and wouldn’t bruise easily. And Americans loved the taste. By the 1980s, close to half of all apples grown in the US were Red Delicious. The trouble is, when you bite into one now, it often doesn’t taste great. People complain of mushy flesh and tough skin. Its defining characteristic can sometimes be that it has no flavor at all. It takes years and a lot of money to develop a good tasting apple, but growers were incentivized to cut costs -- at the expense of taste. That is, until one apple proved them all wrong. The Honeycrisp. The honeycrisp is everything that the Red Delicious was not. When it came out in market in 1991, after 30 years of development, it had a refreshing taste, a delicate skin, and a soft, juicy crunch. And even though it can cost more than two times the average price of apples, consumers then and now are willing to pay a premium price, so much so that it’s now the fifth most produced apple in the US. So the honeycrisp started a sort of revolution in the apple industry: Now that people knew expensive, flavor-focused apples would sell, breeders experimented to create tastier, more inventive varieties. And they sought to protect their apples’ good names, by patenting their trees and trademarking their brand names. This process picked up speed after a 1980 federal law allowed universities to own and patent their inventions, including apple trees. And research programs for apple breeding took advantage of the new rules. In order to plant these new patented varieties, growers had to pay up: usually about $1 per patented tree and a portion of sales for use of a trademarked name. Plus, each trademarked apple had to pass muster on firmness, sugar content, blemishes and color. These quality checks mean that even though the trademarked Pink Lady and the generic Cripps Pink originate from the same type of tree, they look and taste different — the Pink Lady is held to rigorous trademark standards and that is what, the company says, justifies their higher price. Now, not all new apples get trademarked. It is only those that experts believe can garner a premium price. And it can take up to 10 years after securing a patent and trademark to plant and grow enough trees for commercial production. So while they waited on the fruits of their labor, growers worked on marketing their apple in the hopes finding loyal consumers in a competitive market. And they’re not alone. Visit your grocery store and you will see a lot more name brands in the produce section. Branded fruits and vegetables are a growing trend. While not all branded apples will see success on par with the honeycrisp, there is one that has high hopes. Washington State growers are ramping up production of their Cosmic Crisp, an apple that’s both sweet and tart, firm and crisp, and much easier to grow than the honeycrisp. They’re trying to get people excited about tasting something new and that’s not a bad thing. While we could see higher prices in the future, the fruits and veggies themselves will be objectively better. And consumers will have more options, just like we do with our phones, or our computers, or our cereal. And now, our apples. "

102,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,JuRPK6drLbw,"If the US or North Korea had a Facebook page, each country would change their status to “it's complicated” now. It's not what we had as recently as 2017 when Trump was threatening to go to war over and over again with North Korea. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. Now they are not only on speaking terms but literally sitting in a room with each other. We will have a terrific relationship. I have no doubt. Chairman Kim and I just signed a joint statement in which he reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization. The problem with this is that Trump and North Korea have very different views about what should be accomplished when you denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. The US wants North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. North Korea wants the United States to stop isolating it diplomatically and stop cutting it off from international markets. In theory, there is the makings of a deal there. For Trump, denuclearization means something called CVID: complete, verifiable, irreversible denuclearization of North Korea. They give up their nuclear weapons and the US will always be able to make sure that they have gone away. However, for North Korea, denuclearization of the Korean peninsula mean something completely different. It means, sure, North Korea gets rid of its nukes, but the US also withdrawals all its troops from the Korean Peninsula and ends its alliance with South Korea. This has been unacceptable to every American president in the past. We will be stopping the war games, which will save us a tremendous amount of money, unless and until we see that the future negotiation is not going along like it should. What seems really good for North Korea is really bad by American standards. There's just not a great middle ground that could actually roll back North Korea's nuclear program. No country with a nuclear program as advanced as North Korea's has ever denuclearized. A 2017 estimate from the Defense Intelligence Agency concluded that North Korea probably has up to 60 nuclear weapons. It also has ballistic missiles that could potentially hit the American homeland and potentially a nuclear weapon small enough to fit on one of those rockets. National security adviser John Bolton floated an idea for dealing with North Korea that he called, the Libya model. So this is to reference an agreement struck with the Bush administration by then Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi to give up his nuclear program. However, Qaddafi's program was way more limited. He wasn't really even close to a bomb. And, perhaps more to the point, about eight years after this agreement was struck in 2011 the US backed an uprising against Qaddafi which killed him. To Kim, Libya is an example of what happens if you trust the United States too much. It's an example of what happens if you give up your nuclear weapons. The main reason they want them is to deter an attack. Ideally, they want to deter any war from starting by making the war seem really scary and really dangerous and really bloody. Normalizing relations is something that I would expect to do, I would hope to do, when everything is complete. Normalization is a prize from North Korea's point of view. It would mean a US embassy in Pyongyang, a North Korean embassy in Washington, ambassadors, formal diplomatic receptions. And like I'm saying this and you're probably imagining that sounds ridiculous and you're right. Because it's North Korea. Unwavering commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This is the document that we just signed. It's hard to imagine the endgame being some kind of big big deal. What's more likely is nothing changes or things get worse again. I think he’s going to do these things. I may be wrong. I mean I may stand before you in 6 months and say, ‘Hey, I was wrong.’ I don’t know that I’ll ever admit that, but I’ll find some kind of an excuse. "
103,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,K8EVQdIUWBE,"Elephants are one of the most iconic creatures on this planet. They’re the largest land animals, the only surviving members of their order, and they’re highly intelligent, social beings. Reporter #1: ""They're a lot like human babies, actually."" Reporter #2: ""These elephants in Thailand can even paint."" Reporter #3: ""It is the matriarch who guides the herd. It's the older females vast life experience that gives them these skills."" African elephants have been here for a million and a half years. And now, human intervention is literally changing the face of this incredible creature. During the 1500s, an estimated twenty-six million elephants roamed the African continent. Today, it’s less than 500,000. In the 1970s and 80s, elephant poaching reached crisis-levels, so in 1989, an international agreement banned the global ivory trade. But in the past several years, poaching has returned to high levels. This chart shows the percentage of african elephant deaths caused by poaching since 2003. Their ivory tusks are basically just large teeth, but for centuries, they’ve been used in artworks, ornaments, jewelry -- even piano keys. Ivory’s value has been compared to diamonds -- it’s a status symbol. And the rise of China’s middle class has pushed up demand for ivory there, where it sells for around $1100 per kilogram. One-third of an elephant's tusks are in its skull which contains a pulpy cavity of tissues, blood vessels, and nerves. That means they can’t be preemptively removed by conservationists, an approach that has been applied to rhino horns, which aren’t ivory but are also sought after in Asia. Conservationists can safely remove up to 93% of a rhino’s horn, but it’s not possible to remove that much from elephants. But in recent decades there’s been an increasing trend of elephants being born tuskless. While most African elephants of both sexes have tusks, around 2 to 6 percent are naturally born tuskless. Now, decades of heavy poaching have made that trait more common. This chart shows that elephant populations subject to poaching have higher rates of tusklessness compared to undisturbed populations. Let’s use Gorongosa National Park as an example. Of the older female elephants who survived the war, over half were tuskless. And of the younger females born after the war, 33% were tuskless. Because tuskless elephants were less likely to be killed by poachers, the tuskless trait became more common in the next generation. Scientists have also found that on average, tusks are smaller than they were a century ago. Like tusklessness, smaller tusks provide a survival advantage against poaching. But it comes at a cost. Tusklessness is not likely to save the species from poaching and habitat loss. Yet, there is some hope. Through determined conservation efforts, some African national parks are seeing growth in their elephant populations. And China has announced that by the end of 2017, they will end domestic sales and processing of ivory. Those steps, along with stronger incentives to protect elephant habitats and support local anti-poaching programs, might give elephants the leg or tusk up they need to secure their future on this planet. A big thanks to African Parks and the experts I got to interview for this video. If you wanna learn more about their work in elephant conservation, links to their web sites are in the description box. And if you need a little pick-me-up, don't worry I got you covered. Links to baby elephant videos are in there too. "

They wanted to know which colors they associated with girls in their clothing lines. The answers came back pretty mixed. There's also a catalogue in 1918 that suggests that little girls should all wear blue because it's a delicate and dainty color. That’s Jennifer Wright, she’s an author and often writes about history and fashion for Racked. It was only after the war that pink got the symbolic association that we have today. In 1953, Dwight Eisenhower, the general who won World War II, becomes president and this actually turns out to be a pretty important moment in the history of pink. It was Ike's inauguration and Mamie Eisenhower came out in this enormous rhinestone-studded pink ballgown, the likes of which you never would've seen during the war when women were wearing much simpler styles. Mamie Eisenhower loved the color pink, and she was known for it. She thought that the pink really brought our her complexion. She had really pretty blue eyes, it was a nice contrast. In fact, a quick search of newspaper headlines mentioning Mamie Eisenhower also reference the color pink pretty frequently. And it wasn’t just called pink, it was called “Mamie pink” And she went around giving quotes like ""Ike runs the country, I turn the pork chops."" But yeah, it was a very arbitrary decision that she just loved pink and everybody else decided, OK this is the color that lady-like women wear. There's a great song in Funny Face called ""Think Pink."" Where the lady editor of the magazine who is very much based off of Diana Vreeland sings about how women in America today have gotta think pink. And there's a great line in it where she says ""banish the black, burn the blue,"" which are two colors the women would've seen a lot of during the war years. Around this time, pink became a popular color, not only in just women's clothing, but also in the home. This was something a lot of women liked, by the way, it wasn't seen as a terribly oppressive thing. But, there were definitely women like Diana Vreeland who didn't really want to revert to those traditional roles. It was at this point where you start to see the color pink representing women real and fictional who were anything but traditional. The champion racecar driver Donna Mae Mims is a really good example of this. She had a pink uniform and a pink helmet and a pink racecar. There's the pink ladies in Grease and the Plastics in Mean Girls. The girls who are incredibly canny and kind of terrifying, brightly explain There's a great cover of Hillary Clinton on the cover of People magazine wearing a bright pink jacket and the caption next to it is how we need to break the highest, hardest glass ceiling as women. So she's pretty much doing the opposite of what Mamie Eisenhower wanted to do. This isn't just about the color pink, it's about how it's used to define a person's personality and what we think they're capable of. She still wants to show people that really, I'm just a girl, just like you. "

Brock Turner, the Zika virus, Ryan Gosling having a second baby. It's been tough. Donald Trump is accused of assaulting, groping, or harassing 17 different women.

106,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,LPLJgkVsXpE,"When you think of the fight for women’s rights you probably think of pivotal figures such as Jane Addams, Susan B. Anthony, and Sojourner Truth. But squarely in the center of this battle was one tool that completely changed the game. Susan B. Anthony said that it did “more to emancipate women than anything else in the world.” That tool was … the bicycle? To understand how, you first have to understand the bicycle craze of the late 1800s. By the mid 19th century the “ordinary,” or penny-farthing, was the most common kind of bicycle. It was named that because its vastly different wheel sizes resembled the coin currency of the day, a penny and a farthing. You got it. You may have seen examples of these in Victorian illustrations or at your local steampunk meetup. Aside from looking completely ridiculous, these bikes were unwieldy, difficult to operate, and actually super dangerous. Because of the unstable center of gravity, hitting even the smallest bump in the road could send a rider over the front in what was affectionately referred to as a “header.” They were also difficult for women to ride. It turns out it’s virtually impossible to ride a penny-farthing while wearing the giant hoop skirts that were in fashion at the time. Then in 1885 a man came along named John Kemp Starley who said he “felt the time had arrived for solving the problem of the cycle.” He released his invention, the “Rover safety bicycle,” which was basically the first incarnation of what we now consider the modern bicycle. It had two 26-inch wheels, a diamond shaped frame, and a rear drive chain system. Bikes became smaller, safer, and more practical — and guess what, America f***ing loved them. Men and women alike flocked to these “noiseless steeds” in droves. In 1897 alone, over 2 million bicycles were sold. Even though these new modern bicycle designs were becoming enormously popular, and the “drop frame” construction did make it safer and easier to ride, biking in a big, flowing skirt still sucked. At that time many women dressed in voluminous skirts with lots of slips underneath and ruffles and that was not practical on a bicycle. The new bicycle craze helped usher in a “rational dress movement” among women, which advocated moving away from uncomfortable, restrictive dresses. “Bloomers,” baggy undergarments that were more comfortable and practical than hoop skirts, were popular in the 1850s. With the growing popularity of bicycles though in the late 19th century, they came back with a vengeance and were adopted by prominent suffragettes of the time. These changes were threatening to some men though, and many viewed women wearing pants as somehow depraved or immoral. For some reason some men were not happy with the idea of women wearing bifurcated garments. Doctors also chimed in, warning about potential health risks for female cyclists like depression, heart palpitations, as well as something called “bicycle face,” which was said to cause women to become “flushed,” “pale,” and could result in “dark shadows under their eyes.” Still, none of this deterred women. In 1894, after hearing two wealthy Boston men bet $10,000 that a woman couldn’t travel around the globe on a bicycle, Annie Londonderry, a 5’3”, 100-pound housewife that had never ridden a bike before, took on the challenge and with only a pearl handled revolver and change of underwear, braved the desert, wars, and collisions with pigs on her journey around the world, which she completed in 1895. This mass adoption of bicycles significantly helped the feminist movement of the day. It changed the modes of dress and gave women increased mobility, but more importantly it gave them a sense of autonomy. In 1890, just five years after the introduction of the safety bicycle, the National American Woman Suffrage Association was formed with the express purpose of lobbying state to state for women’s right to vote. Two of its founders Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton are quoted as saying that ""woman is riding to suffrage on the bicycle.” And that's exactly what they did in 1920. "
107,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,M0FvLkXDKIs,"This is Whitley County. Like many counties in this region, voters here overwhelmingly supported Donald Trump in November’s election. The county has a median per capita income of around $16,000. It’s 97% white and 88% of the residents over 25 don’t have a college degree. It also happens to be the birthplace for Kentucky Fried Chicken And yet these are some the Americans who have also benefitted most from Barack Obama’s signature healthcare policy. The Affordable Care Act “I'm running around with Vox V O X dot news and all that, and there's a news person and he's following me around to learn about southeastern Kentucky and how the effects of the healthcare have been on us” That’s Kathy. She works as an enrollment counselor for Obamacare, helping people sign up for the program. Since the law was implemented in 2013, the percentage of people in this county with health insurance went from 75% to 90%. And Kathy has signed up a lot of those people. ""Over a thousand..I've lost count"" But here’s the curveball Who did you end up voting for? ""Trump"" Since Obamacare launched in 2013 the number of lower income, less educated white Americans with insurance increased by not just in Kentucky, but nationwide. This group benefitted disproportionately from the law. Yet this same demographic showed up in huge numbers for Trump in November. I went to Kentucky to talk to Kathy. I wanted to understand why so many people would vote for a candidate who swore to repeal a program they depend so much on. Vox would soon be hosting an interview with President Obama and we invited Kathy attend to share her perspective and ask a questions. …”they invited me to the white house Oh my god oh my god oh my god, YES, the white house, right, guess where I'm going Friday? To the White House. You've got to get on Facebook you've really missed out on a lot of stuff. Oh, get on Facebook. Oh, you'll read all about it.” Before going to DC, we traveled around South Eastern Kentucky, talking to Trump supporters who are also enrolled in Obamacare to hear their opinions about the law and what they think the next administration will do to make it better We landed on a couple of explanations for this Trump-Obamacare paradox. The first is that people in Kentucky believe Trump and the GOP would never actually repeal a program that benefits over 20 million people “So you don't think that that, that they would actually do that?” “No, they couldn't. That would be like He's got children, he's smarter than that. you know what I'm saying” A lot of people thought Trump’s campaign rhetoric against Obamacare was all talk and that there’s really no way he would actually repeal a program that so many are dependent on. And it wasn’t just these Trump Voters who thought that. I have been covering the healthcare law as a journalist for about 7 years now. It actually felt like a safe assumption that the ACA, rolled out, covering 20 million people That it was going to stick around. I remember I wrote a story for Vox and the headline was something like ""Obamacare survived its final hurdle and its here to stay"" Republicans up through the election and up after the election remained so committed to repealing the ACA. I did not expect that. I thought we were going to see a backing off of those attitudes. And I was wrong. Many Obamacare enrollees in Kentucky, as well as policy experts and journalists all assumed Obamacare was too widespread to be repealed. But Congressional republicans are proving them wrong, moving as aggressively as they can to repeal it. ""Mr Ryan has said a top priority for the new congress is the repeal of Obamacare. But perhaps the stronger theory on why Obamacare beneficiaries voted for Trump was a general dissatisfaction with the cost of the program and the believe that Trump would somehow make it better for them. We met up with Perry, a security guard recently signed up for Obamacare. It’s the first time he’s ever had health insurance in his life. Perry: ""I've not been to a doctor...you weren't even in this world last time I went to a doctor"" Thanks to Kathy, Perry was able to sign up at healthcare.gov just a few months ago. But his deductible ended up being $2000. ""Unless something drastic was to happen, how many times will I have to go to the doctor, to the hospital or something Before I, you know, use up over 2000 dollars, I just wish that, if they're gonna shove it down your throat, have something that you can afford We headed to an Antique shop in where the owner Bobby, another Obamacare enrollee, talked to us about her experience with the ACA ""I had breast cancer last year. I was very happy to have my insurance. But I didn't realize that the government was subsidizing my health insurance. And I do think everybody deserves quality healthcare. I just think the American form of healthcare is just totally out of hand price wise. One of Bobby’s complaints with the program is that it’s been linked to a president she strongly dislikes ""And I absolutely detest hearing the word Obamacare. Detest it."" We traveled out to mall right on the border with Tennessee where Kathy sets up a booth to sign people up for Obamacare. We talked to the mall manager about all of what he see with his co-workers and employees. “Initially, it seemed that everyone was excited uh that they were going to have an opportunity to have health insurance that they could afford. ﻿To them, some of them, first time in their whole life that they'd ever had coverage. The following year they were faced with the the cost was increasing so they had to make changes again. And most of the time, it meant they were looking for policies that had even higher deductibles ﻿So that they could just try to keep insurance.” While Obamacare lead to 20 million Americans getting health insurance, half of the enrollees who get their insurance on the obamacare marketplace say deductibles are still too high. “I'd say the people are disappointed, yeah, because some of them, because they have such tight budgets. Frustrated with the high rates, ACA enrollees have high confidence that Donald Trump will fix the problems with the health care law. “I think he will try because he's a business person first. And he knows money. So I think he'll fix a lot of things. I think that he will replace it with, or I'm hoping that he will, at least judging by the way he talks, you know, he's going to replace it with something even better. Donald Trump didn’t campaign on a plan to replace Obamacare. Instead he focused on a promise repealing it. It will be repealed and replaced and we'll know and it will be great health care for much less money. An analysis by the non partisan Commonwealth Fund found Trumps proposals would lead up to 25 million people uninsured. But the people we talked to didn’t seem to need a plan. They felt frustrated with the current version of the law and seemed ok to take a gamble on Trump’s promise to “ repeal and replace it with something terrific” Kathy and many others took that gamble. We traveled through a snowstorm, to Fly to DC to meet the president. “Go ahead Kathy” Hello, President Obama, I’m very excited to meet you. Many Kentuckians are looking at the Affordable Care as unaffordable and unusable. how do you think this happened? How can we fix it? Do we start all over again? What do you think we should do? “this is my main criticism of Obamacare is that the subsidies aren’t as high as they probably should be for a lot of working people. So the two things we could do that would really make it work even better for people in Kentucky would be, number one, to provide more subsidies to folks who are working hard every day but still find the premiums — even with the subsidies — hard to meet. The problem is that’s not what’s being proposed by Mitch McConnell, the senator from Kentucky Obama’s answer to Kathy lasted almost 8 minutes and you should watch the full thing to really hear his defense But the gist of his answer is that The Affordable Care Act is imperfect but that the existing law can be improved upon. But the GOP isn’t proposing improvements to the existing law. They are proposing repeal and have yet to articulate how they will legislate something better to take its place I am saying to every Republican right now: “If you can in fact put a plan together that is demonstrably better than what Obamacare is doing, I will publicly support repealing Obamacare and replacing it with your plan.” But I want to see it first. I want to see it first Many took the gamble on Trump without seeing any such plan. And now that the GOP controls congress we will see if they can make good on their promise to build something better than Obamacare. “I thought well, we need something different and that's why I made a joke it was like Russian Roulette or pushing the little Vegas little bar saying hey, I'm going to vote.""

But there's one happy fact about this scenario ISIS is stalled and in Iraq it's actually losing ground. If these trends continue ISIS will be unable to hold on to territory in Iraq in the foreseeable future. When ISIS swept northern Iraq in June 2014 they looked unstoppable. ""How these victories possible these victories come only from Allah and that is how with the small numbers of soldiers that we have we take these massive victories"" But their weaknesses began to be exposed starting as early as August 2014 when ISIS made boneheaded mistake. It invaded Iraqi Kurdistan and threatened Erbil the Iraqi Kurdish capital. ""we will not stop fighting will not put down our weapons until you reach your lands."" The Peshmerga defended themselves and then turned the tables on ISIS and began offensive maneuvers which seriously crimp ISIS' style in northern Iraq. bring every nation that you want to come and fight us it means nothing to us. moreover, there were Americans in Erbil and the United States was not going to allow ISIS to pose a serious threat to its own citizens. So, in August United States began bombing ISIS to protect kurdish holdings and to protect the Yazidi minority in Iraq who ISIS threatened to exterminate. ""And to the leading to Obama , to Tony Abbott, I say this: these weapons that we have the soldiers who will not stop fighting will not put down their weapons."" Iraqi army that was swept over June was week disorganized and were people who fled from the first site of battle. It's smaller now but it shown battlefield capabilities particularly the special forces in combat with ISIS and it's buttressed by an enormous amount Shia militias. These militias together with the Iraqi army are much more disciplined and much more effective than the scattered week Iraqi army in June 2014 was and now that ISIS is facing a serious foe that has adapted itself to their tactics, they're no longer is capable of taking anyone by surprise. the US air strikes since August and September have been more effective than most observers suggested. The reason that's true is ISIS' obsession with territory. They wants to openly defend territory and that means putting troops out in ways that make them vulnerable to air power in conventional battles. that's why US air strikes have been so effective in disrupting ISIS. ""Bring your planes, bring everything you want to us because they will not harm us. Why? because we have Allah! And this is something that you do not have."" To say ISIS is losing isn't to say that ISIS is going to disintegrate sometime in the next year or so. this may take a while. And moreover the group may somehow reconstitute itself as an insurgent group or terrorist group after loses control territory. The fact that ISIS is losing refers to the fact that it it increasingly incapable of holding on the territory which is its key mission right at the Islamic State Shouting in Arabic "

These managers can make cost-cutting measures without the normal political procedure. They decided the city could save money on water.

WOMAN: ""We should not have to pay for the water, it's nasty."" But the city claimed federal tests showed the water was safe. An employee at the Environmental Protection Agency leaked a Michigan report to local activists which showed the water had higher than normal lead levels. The city’s response? Flint told the woman the lead came from her plumbing. It took an outside investigation by Virginia Tech researchers that found elevated lead levels in the water for the state to admit there was a problem in September 2015. EDWARDS: ""So the corrosion's eating up the pipes, it's eating up the iron pipes. It's causing main breaks, discolored water. And in about 20 percent of the homes, there's just too much lead.""

110,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Nd-9op64t2M,"The American system, really in a lot of ways, discourages participation. Elections for Congress in the United States are based on a plurality winner system where you live in one district. Candidates from two or more parties go run in that district, and then whoever gets the most votes wins. Right now many of our maps are incredibly disproportional and in a state like North Carolina Democrats got 47% of the vote but Republicans have over two-thirds of the seats. Meanwhile most of us end up living in congressional districts that aren't competitive. where often the opposition party doesn't run a candidate at all. We end up focusing on a handful of swing seats that happen to be narrowly balanced. There's a very strong incentive to vote for one of the two major parties because people don't want to waste their vote by supporting a third party with no chance of winning. When you have 330 million people and two parties trying to represent them lots of people inevitably are gonna feel left out. You have incredible levels now in the United States of dissatisfaction with the political parties. Americans should think more seriously about switching from our current electoral system to one of any number of more proportional alternatives that could solve a lot of problems that exist in American voting today. In a party list system, it's very simple. Everybody in the state they would go to the voting booth and they would vote for a party that they like best. And then at the end we would see how many votes did each party get and if you got 25 or 30 or 40 percent of the vote that's how many seats you would get. And then the seats would be filled by just sort of running down a list that party leaders had made for themselves. Israel, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany and New Zealand all used variations on this system and as a result voters have lots of choices when it comes to finding a party that represents their interests. And voter turnout in these countries is much higher than in the United States. Another popular system is called an alternative vote system. You show up and you have to rank a whole bunch of candidates in order of preference. A constituency will elect a whole bunch of different members as individuals. But it's still gonna work out that if 40% of people were for Democrats, they'll end up with 40% of the seats. This is how legislators get elected in Australia and Ireland and there too you see lots of political parties. In the American system, a loss is a loss. So Republicans don't really put resources into House races in Massachusetts and Democrats pretty much ignore a place like Alabama. But in a proportional system, both parties would need to fight everywhere. Then they would need to try to engage citizens everywhere. There's no constitutional requirement in the United States that everybody use this district based system. Most states could adopt elements of a proportional system if they wanted to. Sure, the connection between a specific place and a specific legislator would weaken a bit. But it would also solve the problems of gerrymandered districts and break the two-party hold on our political system. You would get a wider range of views represented. You would get a wider range of talents involved in the system. And you have more people feeling that they're represented. "

112,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,NpiDADw5Omw,"Joss: I guess my first question is… What makes fire ants interesting to a bunch of engineers? David Hu: Fire ants are one of the few insects capable of building big structures with their bodies. And they can do it by linking their bodies together. That means fire ants aren’t just animals— they can also be seen as a sort of material that you can test like a fabric or a gel. And you can trace that behavior back to their evolutionary history. Red imported fire ants are native to floodplains in South America, where the rainy season regularly inundates their underground homes. The ants that stick together and stay with the queen have a better chance of reproducing, so they’ve gotten really good at basically holding hands and floating until they find a new place to live. In the 1930s or 40s, shipping brought fire ants to the US and they’ve spread across the southern states. Alabama officials are warning of something that, to me is straight out of a nightmare… It’s a pile of fire ants clustered together to survive. Now, you can find this invasive species alongside roads in cities like Atlanta— easy access for the researchers at Georgia Tech, who’ve done... pretty much anything you could think to do to a colony of fire ants and still call it science. David Hu: We fed ants iodine which is radioactive… flash freezing this with liquid nitrogen… And then an elastic band to the waist of another ant... and then you coat them in gold. But that’s just standard. They’ve created mathematical models to describe the ants behavior and they characterize the ant balls as a “viscoelastic material.” which means they have properties of both a fluid and a solid. David Hu: So they’re a solid in that they’re elastic, so for example, if I... take a spring, you squish it, it’ll give you back the energy. But they also act like a viscous fluid when under stress, breaking and reforming links to dissipate energy in a way that resembles a slow flow. David Hu: And that’s basically how fluids work. They have very small and weak bonds everywhere— like water has these hydrogen bonds. It’s because the bonds can break and reheal really easily. You can see this happening when they’re dropped in water. Within a few minutes, they’ve spread out like a drop of dye. In their study of the towers that fire ants build after floods, Hu’s team found that the ants release their links when the stress is more than 2-3 times the weight of an ant. That’s when they transition from solid to fluid behavior. They’re not sure why the ants build these towers, but it may have to do with the fact that the ants are more water repellent when they’re linked together. Which is how they stay afloat during a flood. David Hu: They link their bodies so closely together they actually generate a weave, like a waterproof fabric. So air bubbles actually have to do work to escape. The ants aren’t drowning because they can get air from those bubbles. What’s so incredible about swarming animals is that there’s no leader directing the colony to do this. And that sort of decentralized, collective action may be a model for future technologies. David Hu: Modular robotics has been the dream of roboticists. And they’re still working on it but these ants have had a couple million years and robotics has only been around for 40 so, I think robots that do act like a fluid and like a solid, I’m hoping that this work will inspire more people to pursue that kind of thing.

CLIP FROM MOVIE: You know if you don’t believe in the Blair Witch then why did you bother to come? I thought the movie was cool Zachary: The sequel got a score of 15 points. The 66 points less. Or take Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, the first Mandarin language film nominated for Best Picture. It went on to win Best Foreign Language film. 16 years later Netflix released a sequel, in English. The orginal got a score of 93. The sequel? Z: So unfortunately it fared much worse. CLIP FROM MOVIE: Too much blazing flame! It got 47. Z: So on the flip side you have films that did really poorly the first time around and somehow miraculously did better when they were made into a sequel. Z: This is a really small contingent of all the sequels we looked at. Less than 25 of the 532 films were improvements. Outside of movies like The Dark Knight and Kill Bill vol 2 most of these movies were tremendously bad to begin with. CLIP: Awe good boy! See I knew you could do it if you put your mind to it. Z: Like for instance Garfield got a score of 27. It’s not that hard to improve on that. Like Garfield Part 2 got 37 which is still pretty bad. Z: The worst ones fall into 1 of 3 categories. It’s either a horror, comedy, or action film. So I wanted to see if that’s a bigger indication of how critics rate those movies. Z: So I looked at a randomized selection of 200 films from every single genre. And then averaged out the score for each genre. This chart reveals that the genres with the worst sequels also fair pretty badly amongst critics in general. Despite all of this, Hollywood loves making them. So much so that this year alone an unprecedented 37 sequels will be released. The reason? Money. Z: The average sequel makes 8x the average original release. That’s $160,000,000 dollars over the $20,000,000 original. Grown Ups, the Adam Sandler movie which was rated an abysmal 30% on metacritic received 270 million dollars worldwide. Its sequel, which somehow dropped 11 points still managed 247 million dollars worldwide. It was a box office hit. Audiences had no reason to give Grown Ups 2 a chance. And yet they did. Roger Ebert famously said “No movie executive was fired because he greenlit a sequel.... But movie critics despair of sequels as betraying a lack of imagination and originality."" If you have any doubts about how true that is give Grown Ups 2 a whirl. "
114,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,P8aW1Ae6gcI,"Getting a show from script to screen is a fast and furious process. Some crews make thirteen episodes of scripted TV in the same amount of time it takes to make a single blockbuster movie. So how do they do it? This process applies to all types of scripted TV shows – both dramas and comedies – but we're gonna use an hourlong drama with a 13 episodes season as an example. Let's say you're the showrunner. This is what the next year of your life is going to look like. First thing's first: you and the writers break the story. Meaning you plot out the major moments of the season. And then you assign  writers to break the story for each episode. After multiple drafts a script around 45 pages is created. That's about six hundred pages of material for the whole season. At this point episodes are assigned to directors and directors of photography who begin planning on their own and then there's the art department. They're in charge of the whole look of the show. Let's say the show takes place in New York City in 1980. The art department researchers the period so that everything as big as buildings and cars and as small magazines and jewelry look realistic. Now let's get shooting. To shoot 45 pages of material in about 8 days you need a serious schedule. A traditional script isn't all that helpful to a crew. So first each scene is assigned a location, time of day, and actors. After all these factors are prioritized the result is a document called a white schedule. Once shooting begins every episode requires a table read. That's when the whole cast gets together and reads the script from beginning to end. At this point the director works with the director of photography to correctly block all the actors and every scene is shot from multiple angles. A one-minute scene in a show could easily take a few hours to shoot. Now you might not think your typical drama would not have a lot of visual effects but something as little as a TV playing in the background of a scene requires post-production work. Ever heard the phrase ""we'll fix it in post."" Here we go. A post production team is comprised of editors, sound designers, visual effects artists, and all the assistants and coordinators that go along with them. Editors make the first cut of the episode and give it to the director. Then the director's cut goes to the showrunners. The showrunners give notes, create a producer's cut, and that goes to the studio which then becomes the network cut. During this entire process things like that TV with the green screen get pushed through visual effects. Once all of the edits are final, a color corrector and sound designer begin to work their magic. The dialogue needs to be cleaned up, sound effects put in, and the entire edit needs to be mixed. OK, we're almost done. It's now several months after writing began and the episode, fully mastered, gets serviced to broadcasters around the country. But the rest of the show isn't finished. Every episode is finalized just a few weeks, and sometimes just a few hours, before it premieres. "

I was told to turn around as soon as I got to the polar bear warning sign. Sasha gave me this vest and said that if you leave the settlement without a gun you have to be wearing something bright to scare off polar bears... Okay. Now I'm running with a dog named little snowball. Come on Little Snowball, let's do this. So it Sasha's goal to curate a group of Russian dogs. This dog is named Dan, and he's giving me a run for my money. Here's a tricky thing about these dogs being Russian dogs: even though they have an origin in Russian traditional culture meaning these breeds were literally created by Russian communities many years ago - even though that's the case dog breeding in the 20th century became this very official enterprise and with that came all this authority and bureaucracy surrounding and it's kind of these international conventions and authorities to set the parameters of what is a husky? And what is a golden retriever? Excuse my ignorance I don't really know many dog breeds. But during this time, when dog breeding became super official and international, the Soviet Union was isolated from the world. People from the Soviet Union couldn't go to dog shows in Spain and Portugal and the United States and so because of that the Western world kind of co-opted these breeds. So, all these Russian dogs that we're looking at here, are technically under the authority and administered by the Nordic Dog Union. It's kind of a strange irony. I'm not going to tell Sasha that, it might burst her bubble, but to me little snowball you'll always be Russian. Here we are again with Tor, who happens to be not only Norwegian and Nordic but also the son of a world-renowned dog breeder and dog show judge. So Tor, are these dogs Russian or do they belong to the authority of the Nordic Dog Union? Yeah, so I've talked to my mom about this and she was like oh yeah they're all Nordic. But then I was like, but it's Siberian husky and it's Samoyed and it's from Siberia. Like, clearly these are Russian. I think they're Russian. They're developed 3,000 years ago by Inuits and Siberian peoples and then some Europeans just ""discovered"" them or take them away from the Communists and just say like oh we're going to take over from here, good job. I think they're Russian. "
116,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,RLCUphApmr8,"There is this story from the Constitutional Convention of 1787. When it ended, Ben Franklin walked out of Philadelphia’s Independence Hall to find this anxious crowd. And there was a woman from Philadelphia who was the first to speak to him. And she asked ""Well, doctor, what have we got, a republic or a monarchy?"" And Franklin’s reply is really famous: ""A republic,” he said. “If you can keep it."" If we can keep it. We have lost something Franklin had: a sense that this is an experiment, and it can fail, things can, truly go wrong. And I think one lesson of Trump is we need to rediscover that catastrophic imagination, because there is a big flaw at the center of America’s democracy, and Trump found it, and he used it, and other people are going to find it and use it too. This election is close. Close enough that something small could have completely thrown it — if Trump were just a bit more self-disciplined, if he hadn’t bragged about sexual assault while wearing a microphone, if Clinton’s pneumonia had lingered a bit longer, America would be ruled by a cruel narcissist with authoritarian ambitions. And when I say authoritarian ambitions, I mean it. One of the truly important things we’ve learned about Trump is that he he admires dictators for being dictators. He was asked about Vladimir Putin, and said: ""He's running his country, and at least he's a leader, unlike what we have in this country."" ""Yeah but again, he kills journalists that don't agree with him."" About North Korea’s Kim Jong Un, he said: He goes in and he takes over, he's the boss. It's incredible."" And here Trump was on Saddam Hussein: ""He killed terrorists. He did that so good. They didn't read them the rights."" The thing to note there is it’s not just that Trump admires authoritarians. What he admires about them is that they are authoritarians. He likes that they dispense with niceties like a free press, due process, and political opposition. Trump has promised to bring this perspective to America. He says he’ll jail Hillary Clinton if he’s elected. He wants to strengthen libel laws to make it easier to cow the press. During rallies, he pushed his followers to assault protestors, and promised to pay their legal fees if they get arrested. Imagine someone like that with the power to pardon. So even if we dodge the bullet, we still need to understand how it is that we as a country came to be standing in front of a gun. It would’ve been no surprise to the Founding Fathers that Americans have proven susceptible to the charms of a demagogue. In Federalist 10, James Madison wrote that “Men of factious tempers, of local prejudices, or of sinister designs, may, by intrigue, by corruption, or by other means, first obtain the suffrages, and then betray the interests, of  the people.” That is Founding Father speak for, ""yeah, demagogues are appealing."" They can win elections. And then they can betray the very people who elected them. That’s why we have a representative government, not a democracy. It’s part of why the American presidency is so weak. They always saw the popular will as a point of failure, a weakness. And it is credit to the long success of the political institutions they created that we think dangerous men can only win elections in far-off lands. But what’s happening here, what's happening now is that our institutions are weakening. And that’s where we have to turn to understand Trump. To our institutions. Donald Trump did two things to get this close to the presidency. The first was that he won the Republican primaries. The second is that after winning the primaries, he united the Republican party behind him. These are not the same thing, even though they're often conflated. Trump only had 13.8 million votes when he won the Republican primaries. The distance between those 13.8 million votes and the more than 60 million votes he's expected to get in the election is vast. In 1972, for instance, George McGovern won the Democratic primary even though much of of the Democratic Party hated him. Major Democratic interest groups, like the AFL-CIO, refused to endorse him in the general election, and top Democrats, including former governors of Florida, Texas, and Virginia, organized “Democrats for Nixon.” McGovern went on to lose with less than 40 percent of the vote, a dismal showing driven by Democrats who abandoned a nominee they considered unacceptable. A similar path was possible for Trump. Top Republicans viewed him with horror. ""This man is a pathological liar. A narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen."" ""Donald Trump's candidacy is a cancer on conservatism, and it must be clearly diagnosed, excised, and discarded."" ""Donald Trump is a delusional narcissist and an orange-faced windbag. A speck of dirt is way more qualified to be president."" And then every single one of those Republicans endorsed Donald Trump. So did Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell It is not surprising with this kind of elite support that Trump managed to get Republican-leaning voters behind him. The final NBC/WSJ poll of the election found that 82 percent of likely Republican voters were supporting Trump — a precise match for the 82 percent of likely Democratic voters supporting Clinton. There are two things to say about this. The first is moral. There are many Republicans who honestly believe Trump would make a good, or at least adequate, president; their endorsement of his candidacy is perfectly honorable, even if I think it wrongheaded. But many of the Republicans mentioned here believe Trump is a threat to world peace and to fundamental norms, values, and institutions of American democracy; their endorsements of his candidacy will stain their careers, and if he is elected, and if the worst comes to pass, they will be remembered by history for their abandonment of country. But the second thing that needs to be said here is structural. And, believe it or not, that’s where it actually gets scary. Here is the single most important sentence for understanding both Trump’s rise and this dangerous era in American politics: That sentence comes from political scientist Julia Azari, and her point is this: Parties, and particularly the Republican Party, can no longer control whom they nominate. But once they nominate someone — once they nominate anyone, even Donald Trump — that person is guaranteed the support of both the party’s elites and its voters. Let’s look at that in two pieces. First, how did parties lose control of their primaries? Primaries used to not matter that much...party officials made the decisions that counted at the conventions, where they had almost total control. But we’ve moved in recent decades towards primaries, they're more democratic, they give voters more of a voice. That's made parties and party officials less important. But one way parties kept influence in primaries was through money. Party organizations, they signal to party donors which candidates to back, who to take seriously. But money turned out to be much less important to winning primaries than anyone thought — just ask Jeb Bush, who spent $130 million only to be humiliated, even as Trump spent almost nothing to win. Similarly, parties used to drive media attention by signaling to reporters which candidates to take seriously. But that process has also democratized — just look at Trump’s twitter feed, and how it can drive news coverage on its own. But the most important thing parties have is the trust of their voters. That’s why endorsements matter...They represent party officials using the credibility they have built with their supporters to tell them whom to vote for. Trump didn’t have any Republican endorsements of note until he had already won a bunch of primaries. And that arguably helped him — it was proof that he really was untouched and untainted by the unpopular Republican establishment. That Republican elites have so totally lost the faith of their base that their efforts to persuade Republican voters were ignored at best and counterproductive at worst is a tremendous failure of the Republican Party. So that's how the party loses control of its primaries. But then there's a puzzle: If partisans have so little faith in their party, then why are they so much likelier to back whomever their party nominates? The answer, in short, is fear and loathing of the other party. In 1964, 31 percent of Republicans had cold, negative feelings toward the Democratic Party, and 32 percent of Democrats had cold, negative feelings toward the Republican Party. By 2012, that had risen to 77 percent of Republicans and 78 percent of Democrats. That is a lot more anger and fear toward the other party. Today, fully 45 percent of Republicans, and 41 percent of Democrats, believe the other party’s policies “threaten the nation’s well-being.” This fear is strongest among the most politically involved. Which makes sense: You're more likely to take an active interest in American politics if you think the stakes are really high. But that means the people driving American politics — and particularly the people driving low-turnout party primaries — have the most apocalyptic view of the other side. The angrier and more fearful partisans are, the more of a market there is for media that makes them yet angrier and yet more fearful. It is no accident that the CEO of Breitbart News, a hyper-ideological conservative media outlet that specializes in scaring the hell out of its audience, is leading Trump’s campaign. One reason Trump has been able to unite Republicans is that Republican-leaning media has convinced itself, and its base, that the alternative to Trump is a literal criminal who belongs in jail. This offers a rationale for voting Republican even if you don’t particularly like your candidate: a majority of Trump voters say they are voting against Clinton rather than for Trump. This helps explain the unified party support for Donald Trump. Republican officeholders are terrified that if they don’t support him, or are seen as in any way contributing to Clinton’s election, they’ll face the wrath of their conservative base. So here, then, is the key failure point in modern American politics, and observing it in action requires looking no further than the Republican Party: Voters’ dislike of their own party has broken the primary process, but fear of the opposition has guaranteed unified party support to the nominee. That means whoever manages to win a flawed competition dominated by the angriest, most terrified partisans ends within spitting distance of the presidency. Elites are often blamed for Trump’s rise — he is said to be the backlash to their failures, their corruption, their obliviousness, their self-dealing, their cosmopolitanism, their condescension. All that may be true, but past moments in American politics have also featured angry voters, out-of-touch elites, and social problems. Those moments, however, featured political and media gatekeepers with more power, and so Trump-like candidates were destroyed in primaries, or at conventions, or by a press that paid them little mind. Now, however, traditional gatekeepers have neither the power nor the cultural capital to stop Trump-like candidates. And in the Republican Party, where the collapse of institutional authority is most severe and most dangerous, the aftermath of a Trump loss will further weaken the party’s center, Trump’s supporters are going to turn on the Republican Party officials whose tepid backing they feel doomed their candidate. Sean Hannity has already called Paul Ryan a “saboteur.” The country is on a fast path to becoming majority minority, and many white male voters will continue to perceive this change as a loss in both status and political power, which, in some ways, it is. Now it's not to say Republicans will always, or even routinely, nominate candidates as dangerous as Trump. Much had to go wrong for him to be nominated. The lesson of this unnerving year is that less can be taken for granted than we thought — the American people are not immune to demagogues, and the American political system is too weakened to reliably stop them. America, like all the world’s other countries, is vulnerable to catastrophic political failure. It can happen here. Trump is a crude and undisciplined demagogue. But we need to remember: The world also produces clever, disciplined demagogues. And they are the ones who truly threaten republics. "
117,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Rbdt6PXNJ18,"An inaugural address can be a defining moment for a president and certain lines become iconic. ""Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country."" But why do some addresses echo through history while others don’t? I asked Kathleen Hall Jamieson I am director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at The University of Pennsylvania And what she told me is that an inaugural address should do three things: unify the country, announce guiding principles, and affirm the limits of power. So let’s take those one by one, starting with the need to unify the country. One of the more important characteristics of an inaugural is that it establishes that this is the president of all the people. Coming after a campaign, a president’s first task to heal a divided electorate. In 1801, Jefferson welcomed his opponents when he said, “Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.” And in 1953, Eisenhower echoed Jefferson’s plea for unity, ""May cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who, under the concepts of our Constitution, hold to differing political faiths…” Eisenhower’s inaugural explicitly suggests that we are coming together in this moment regardless of the kind of partisan divisions that we have had in the past. That’s actually a common theme across the inaugurals. We remember it more when it is phrased more memorably, as it is with Jefferson or Eisenhower, but you’ll actually find an element of it in virtually all of the inaugural addresses. Second, an inaugural should announce principles that will guide the presidency. “We'll restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost.” But, unlike the state of the union, the inaugural should focus on principles, not policy. When you get to policy proposals, you’re back in campaign mode. “In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” Notice that when Reagan said, ‘government isn’t the solution, government is the problem’, what he was essentially doing was articulating a principle, not saying, ‘and as a result, I recommend that we do x, y, and z.’ The philosophy of the president is embodied in an inaugural and if it’s maintained at a level of principle it is not highly problematic. Third, an inaugural affirms the limits of power, stating that no one is above the law. One concern -- when you let some president -- particularly among those who didn’t vote for the candidate -- is that person may overreach and may misuse the power or use the power in ways that will hurt the people that did not vote for the president. Look at the passage in Gerald Ford’s inaugural address -- which was, in effect his inaugural address -- that begins, “...our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution works; our great Republic is a government of laws and not of men.” That is a repudiation of the Nixon Presidency. Ford is affirming it explicitly: that no president is above the law. That’s the speech that tells us that, in language that we should always remember. Besides indicating what the address should be about, past inaugurals suggest how a president should deliver it. First, they should keep it short. People who assume that you have to speak at length in order to be eloquent are wrong. A leader’s message should be clear and concise. The three shortest speeches were delivered by some of the most respected presidents, albeit during subsequent inaugurals; while the three longest came from some less well-known presidents, including William Henry Harrison, who aggravated a cold during his epic inaugural and died the next month from pneumonia. Second... Put the campaign behind you. Do not be Ulysses S. Grant, who whines about having a scandal-ridden campaign. “I have been the subject of abuse and slander scarcely ever equaled in political history, which today I feel that I can afford to disregard in view of your verdict, which I gratefully accept as my vindication.” If you come out of an inaugural address feeling as if the candidate is still there and the president isn’t -- we’re still in campaign mode, this isn’t a president speaking -- it’s a failed address. A third caution is to avoid making it about yourself, which a president can do by using “we” instead of “I”. When you’re trying to speak to a nation that has been divided by a campaign, the unifying rhetoric requires that the audience hear itself in the rhetoric. And as a result, the collective rhetoric -- the rhetoric of “we” -- is the characterizing rhetoric of the best inaugural addresses. “…let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is... fear itself.” Lastly, and most importantly, we tend to remember inaugurals.. ...because history vindicated the observation and the observation was made memorably. So, you might say that the deciding factor for a successful inaugural speech is the presidency that follows. There’s a reason we remember FDR and Kennedy. Both were speaking at a point of crisis and their words inspired a future that would follow. But no president did this better than Abraham Lincoln, who on the eve of Civil War, predicted a Union victory when he said: “The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.” "
118,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Ry5jTjBhZpA,"I think most Americans believe that after you commit a crime and pay your debt to society, the punishment ends. You have the chance to rebuild your life and get a fresh start. But the reality is much harsher. We punish people with criminal records long after they’ve paid their debt to society. And we all suffer for it. Even simply being accused of a crime is just the beginning of “perpetual punishment”: a cycle of legalized discrimination, poverty, and reincarceration; a cycle kept in motion by 47,000 laws and regulations nationwide that restrict critical rights and opportunities. After contact with the criminal justice system, millions of Americans are: denied employment and housing, denied college educations, excluded from public benefits, separated from their children, deported, despite being legal residents. These restrictions trap the poor and people of color in invisible cages that extend far beyond prison walls and criminal courts. Cages that lead to a lifetime of obstacles that undermine even the most earnest efforts at rehabilitation and redemption. Cages that send the message: You will never be a part of society again. This is not some isolated problem. 95% of all incarcerated people will return home at some point. Each year, more than 600,000 people are released from jails and prisons. That’s roughly the population of Boston or Seattle. Millions more are completing non-jail sentences like probation, community service, or fines. As a reentry specialist at Brooklyn Defender Services, a public defense firm representing 45,000 clients per year, I work on the front lines to help people with criminal histories overcome their past and navigate the obstacles of their present, so they can build a sustainable future. I try to help folks take responsibility for their own lives. But it’s hard to do when the outlook is so bleak. Even for low-level offenses and misdemeanors, the aftermath of one individual’s experience with the criminal justice system ripples out to entire families and neighborhoods, and gets passed down from generation to generation. The result: more poverty, more crime, more incarceration. I see Javon, an 18-year-old young man who cannot live with or even visit his family, and cannot find an affordable apartment, because he was convicted of gun possession and banned from all public housing. I see the dangerous shelters and street corners where he’ll sleep. I worry about what he's going to have to do to survive; how long it’ll be before he’s back behind bars. I see how society loses when Judy, a 58-year-old grandmother charged with a misdemeanor, is fired after her arrest and barred from her lifelong profession as a home health aide. Unable to work, she’s faced with eviction and can’t support her family. When Malik, a 26-year-old father, is denied the opportunity to further his education because of the mistakes of his past, I think about how he and so many others are set up to fail. How a conviction on a rap sheet is only a snapshot of a moment in time, when all of us are dynamic, changing over time. The criminal justice system disenfranchises these men and women, preventing them from growing, from truly being free. I am among the very few fortunate enough to be living a second chance. Three decades ago, I was involved in a crime that took the life of another human being. I spent over 24 years in prison for my role in that reprehensible crime. While incarcerated, I had the chance to participate in a pilot program, offered to only 15 inmates, that allowed me to pursue a formal education. &nbsp;Upon release, I found an employer willing to look beyond my criminal record; one that saw the hard lessons I learned in prison as an asset, not a liability. Affording people a real opportunity to reenter society isn’t just good for individuals and families; it’s good for all of us. Meaningful reentry increases productivity, reduces poverty, and saves money. Most importantly, it makes us safer, by eliminating the circumstances that perpetuate cycles of crime and punishment. People already get punished harshly by the system — but they should not receive a second sentence that makes discriminating against them legal for the rest of their lives. By restoring full rights of citizenship to people after they’ve been through the system, we can start to end this cycle of perpetual punishment. We can start to abolish the justice trap. "
119,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,T2LAd43JoP4,"When you picture a superhero, who do you see? Batman? Superman? Spiderman? The Hulk? Thanks to a growing collection of data, we know that our cultural icons are not consistent with what we look like as a country. This fact extends to virtually every form of mass media in the States. Our best data suggests that the American population is roughly equal in gender, and about 38% are a minority of some sort. Which reveals a simple truth about the latest Marvel superhero film: People are excited about Black Panther because the demand for media that centers minorities is far greater than the available supply. This becomes obvious when you look at a series of studies by UCLA’s school of sociology. Much of what we knew about diversity in Hollywood was anecdotal. So we decided to design a report that would be the gold standard in terms of looking at the birds eye view of what’s happening and tracking that over time. Roughly 1 out of every 10 major films are directed by minorities. A similar percentage cast minorities in their lead roles. And even fewer of these films are written by minorities. This principle applies to nearly every facet of media, including executives and talent agents. You can’t underestimate the role of the gatekeepers. If you’re not on the roster, you’re going to have a hard time breaking in. Which of course has created obstacles for people of color and women, in particular. Which means that the culture represented on screen is determined by a sample that doesn’t accurately represent the population. If you look at pop culture depictions of Africa, you don’t ever get to see this place that’s supposed to be the future. Wakanda is almost like this rewriting of history of what life would’ve been like. It’s this amazing fantasy that you never get to see on screen. Black Panther is all about representation. It centers the story on women and people of color. And that representation matters to young people. They're the future target audience. The minority share of the population was relatively low in 1970. But today, nearly 40% of the US population is in a minority group. And that percentage is only expected to increase. The genre doesn’t matter. Audiences want to see people like themselves on the screen. If you have a good story, and the narrative is compelling, and you have people of color in it, then diverse audiences are probably going to go see it. "
120,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,TCDSqgs8qNo,"All the mainstream media wants to talk about is Russia, Russia, Russia! But what about the president’s accomplishments? So it’s been a bad week for the Trump administration. Newly released emails show that Trump Jr., Trump’s former campaign chair, and Trump’s son-in-law all met with a Russian attorney in June of 2016 after being promised damaging info about Hillary Clinton. And they did it believing that that info was coming from the Russian government, which was trying to help Trump win the election. That’s a huge deal. It shows the Trump campaign’s intent to collude with Russia, and it potentially violates federal law regarding soliciting information from hostile foreign governments. That being said, it’s been a hilarious week to watch Fox News. And I’m not really dating anyone right now, so I decided to compile my favorite Fox News defenses of Trump Jr.’s Russia meeting. Please enjoy. Mainstream media is once again foaming at the mouth over Russia, Russia, Russia. Number one, Trump Jr. is the real victim here. Don Jr is the victim here. ... It looked like the whole thing was a setup. If I was Don Jr., I’d be furious. Genius. They think that this meeting could’ve been a setup, made to give the appearance of Russian collusion. Somebody set up the meeting, got Trump Jr. to agree to it, and then waited for months until after Hillary lost the election to make it public. Well, this seems to be a setup of some sort. Two: How was he supposed to know what collusion is? He’s not a seasoned political operative; he’s just trying to help his father. There’s a big difference between collusion and just not knowing better. This just goes to show how far they’ve matured as the campaign has gone on. ... We were new to this. Nice. Lowest possible bar. Three: Who wouldn’t agree to collude with the Russian government? I’m sorry, but how could you not listen to that?... Whoever turns down gossip about an enemy, no one ever does. And you don’t even give a damn about the source. That is, like, Fox News’s philosophy in a nutshell, actually. Four: You guessed it. We know real felonies, real crimes were committed. Hillary Clinton was worse. Hillary Clinton mishandled top-secret information. I am genuinely concerned about Sean Hannity at this point. What we’re now living through is a massive, huge double standard. Can you imagine if Hillary had actually won the election? Hannity’s show would just be him getting “but her emails” tattooed on different parts of his body every night. Five: This is actually all Obama’s fault. If you have a problem with what Russia’s doing… Uh-huh. then you have a problem with what... You got this. Barack Obama did to stop them from doing it. He never, apparently... Stick the landing! never stopped any of this from happening. Nice! Makes no sense! Six: The real problem is people leaking to the press. Wound up in the hands of the New York Times. This White House has got a leakage problem. Are you saying the White House needs a plumber? I’m so dead inside. And the last and maybe least funny one: So what? The meeting was meaningless. Did nothing to produce anything. Where’s the collusion? Trump Jr. left without getting any dirt on the rival campaign, let alone making any agreement to sell out his country. There was no collusion because she didn’t give you anything. What’s so wrong with trying to work with a hostile foreign government to influence the election? Donald Trump Jr. broke no laws, likely broke no ethics rules. Listening is not a crime. Listening to people is not a crime. A 20-minute meeting to listen to something is not collusion. How many lobbyists in Washington routinely meet with foreign agents who are seeking to influence American policy? That’s standard here and has been for a long time. This kind of stuff is harder to laugh at. For one, it’s wrong. Having contact with foreign governments is not the same as working with a hostile one to influence the election, for Christ’s sake. And soliciting information like this could actually be a violation of federal law, even if Trump Jr. got nothing out of it. But the real reason this talking point is scary is because it’s downplaying a gross violation of democratic norms. I’ve never seen liberals so mad. You would’ve thought someone lit a cigarette in a restaurant or forgot to recycle. I mean, that level of rage. Fox is training its viewers to roll their eyes. The mainstream media’s obsession with Russia continues. But do you, the people, even care about that? To treat collusion as just another Democratic talking point. This is part of the normal process of the dirty political system that we live in today. Always happens. And if anyone says it doesn’t, it’s a lie. And as this Russia story keeps getting worse, we’re going to see just how far the network is willing to go to stay on Trump’s good side. "
121,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,TJ5C7TsBsao," In late August 2005, Hurricane Katrina was moving its way across the Gulf coast. It was classified as a Category 3 storm. Dangerous, but in a region with a long history of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes, it wasn’t expected to be the most intense. Katrina was only one day away from the Louisiana coast when the mayor of New Orleans issued an evacuation order. Unfortunately, it was too late. The sea level had already risen in a phenomenon called storm surge. Water rapidly rose up against the city's levees, a series of walls designed to keep the area from flooding. Before Katrina made landfall, the levees broke. A wall of water rushed into the city, trapping thousands. What followed was one of the worst natural disasters in US history. ""We're expecting storm surge of 20 to 30 feet high"" ""Flood waters are drenching city streets ""A levee broke during the height of the storm"" ""There are bodies...uh... floating in the water there."" Storm surge was the main cause of death during Hurricane Katrina. In fact it can be the most dangerous part of any hurricane. It occurs when strong winds from an approaching hurricane push water into the shore. As the sea rises, a bulge of water sweeps over coastal areas, causing destruction along the way. These are the normal astronomical tides at Dauphin Island to the east of New Orleans. When you compare them to the water levels during hurricane Katrina — you can see the dramatic rise. That’s the storm surge. What makes this rise dangerous is that it starts to build up before the hurricane makes landfall So the coastal flooding from it can make evacuation procedures and the impact of a hurricane much worse. In 2008, hurricane Ike caused a big storm surge around Galveston, TX a day before landfall. The rising water cut off evacuation routes stranding hundreds. More recently, the National Hurricane Center issued dire warnings for the storm surge accompanying Hurricane Irma, the most powerful storm to ever rage through the Atlantic Ocean. A storm surge can also be unpredictable. Rising sea levels caused by global warming increase the risk of storm surge. But there are many factors that can change its size and strength. For example, the largest one recorded before Katrina was about 22 feet, during Hurricane Camille in 1969. But Camille was a category 5 storm with 190 mph winds. Katrina was only a category 3 with 130 mph winds, but it had a storm surge of about 28 Katrina had slower winds than Camille but it was twice as wide, which dramatically increased the storm surge. These calculations help forecasters warn communities at risk. But they’re often not enough to prevent damage on the ground. This map shows the highest storm surge events worldwide since 1880. In the US, the eastern and southeastern coastlines are among the most vulnerable areas for storm surges in the world. Along the east coast, hurricane Sandy got its strength from a massive storm surge in 2012. On the Gulf Coast side, places like Texas and South Florida have seen multiple hurricanes so they've built infrastructure to help defend against excessive flooding. Levees and seawalls are designed to stop or redirect rising water away from cities. But even those can be inadequate, as seen during hurricanes Katrina and more recently, Harvey. What really concerns experts, though, are places that don’t experience a lot of hurricanes but are still vulnerable to storm surge. This map shows that in the event of a big hurricane, based on the characteristics of the shoreline, the coasts of Northwest Florida and Georgia would be at comparable risk to the Gulf Coast. These areas have shallow water, which means sea level can rise faster and water can reach further inland making the flooding worse. But they’ve seen fewer hurricanes than the Gulf Coast and they are likely to be less prepared. So when a major hurricane like Irma hits low-lying areas like these, the storm surge can be the first and deadliest thing headed their way. "

Without KYUK without public broadcasting here, it would essentially be an information dark zone for households all over this area. Right now in Washington, DC, there’s a bill to eliminate funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting... The CPB receives about $450 million a year from the government and then distributes it to PBS, NPR, and hundreds of local TV and radio stations. ...on top of that, we’ve got a president who’s put out a budget that also calls for the elimination of public broadcasting. Can we really continue to ask a coal miner in West Virginia or a single mom in Detroit to pay for these programs? The answer was no. We can ask them to pay for defense, and we will. But we can’t ask them to continue to pay for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. We do have internet but a lot of the time the speeds are slow. We are looking at some of the highest rates in the nation. So not everyone can afford it. But even if everyone could afford to have cable or dish or internet, what they would be lacking without KYUK is any sort of daily local journalism and information. We live in a census area where Yupik is the main language spoken. So we translate our newscasts in Yupik. so that everyone can understand in a language that they understand best what’s going on in the world. Threats to government funding of public media, it’s nothing new. I’m sorry, Jim, I’m going to stop the subsidy to PBS, I’m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird, I actually like you too. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting began in 1967; By 1969, Mr. Rogers was already before the US Senate, testifying for them to not cut funding. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides about 60% of our funding. 10% of our funding comes from the state. The other 30% we raise on our own. As a small station operating in an area that’s economically impoverished, the economy is not strong. Government funding is vital. If federal funding were cut for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, there would be information blackouts in parts of the United States because we simply couldn’t serve all the areas that we serve now, and other stations would be in the same boat. I tell everyone that I come across, and I would tell every politician, senator, congressperson the same thing: that without a fully informed electorate we’re not a strong democracy, and to realize that information is something that they need to prioritize as well, and that we can do it relatively inexpensively. A zero funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would be devastating for rural Alaska. Absolutely devastating. "
123,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,TSDC7CCyeGY,"Donald Trump has business dealings all over the world. With Trump in as president, leaders in at least 18 countries have more than political interest in the United States. They will also have potential business leverage to curry favor with President Trump. Take China. China is home to the country’s largest state-owned commercial bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. But it has an office in Trump Tower in New York City. Which means that a foreign government, China, will be paying its landlord, who also happens to the President of the United States, nearly $2 million a year in rent. Trump has expressed pride in this arrangement. ""People think I don't like China -- I love China. The largest bank in the world is a tenet of mine in Trump Tower.” But it could get him in trouble A section of the Constitution called the Emoluments Clause says Presidents can’t accept payments or gifts from foreign governments. The Founders added it during the Constitutional Convention of 1787 because they were worried about foreign governments using money to influence American politicians. But it’s never really been tested by a President. Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush all had business ventures before entering the Oval Office, but they entrusted their businesses and investments to outsiders who they didn’t communicate with while in office. This arrangement is called a blind trust-- which is also what Donald Trump calls his plan to put his children in charge of his business. But as long as his children can talk to him about the business, this won’t exempt him from conflicts of interest. You can see why if you look at Japan. When Trump met the country’s Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, a few days after the election, Ivanka Trump was also there. At the time, Ivanka was working to close a business deal between her clothing line and a Japanese company called Sanei International; a company whose largest shareholder happens to be a state-owned bank controlled by the Japanese government. Ivanka’s old company is still part of her father’s company. So if Abe were to put pressure on the bank to finalize the Sanei deal, Trump would benefit financially. And even if Trump keeps Ivanka out of future meetings with heads of state, they’ll still have her husband, Jared Kushner’s ear. Trump’s son-in-law will serve as a senior advisor. Vice President Mike Pence has tried to downplay Trump’s conflicts of interest. “If his kids are running the business, and we’re talking about buildings here, if he doesn't divest himself of the business, a lot of people are saying turn it into cash, he’s going to know who the kids are doing business with. In fact there was just a meeting in the last few days with some of his partners form India. Doesn't that create a tremendous danger of a conflict of interest?” “In a recent interview, after the election, Donald Trump summed up his view of his business life with two words. He said, who cares?"" But his actions indicate that that he does care. After the election, Trump met with British politician Nigel Farage. During their meeting, Trump complained about a proposed wind farm wrecking the view from his golf course in Aberdeen Scotland. Trump reportedly urged Farage to oppose the proposal, and though nothing has happened so far, Trump’s willingness to mix private and political matters creates the impression that he might be willing to trade political favors for personal profit. In Turkey, that seems to have happened already. After Trump called for an American ban on Muslims, Prime Minister Erdoğan demanded that his name be removed from the Trump Towers in Istanbul. But when a military coup threatened Erdoğan’s power, Trump expressed his support. “That was a quick coup, I was actually surprised to see how well it was handled.” Erdoğan backed down, and Trump’s name remains on the towers. Since Trump refuses to disclose all of his business dealings, we can’t know how many others might exist. But the one that looms largest is Russia. A leaked intelligence report indicates that Putin and the Russian government may have compromising material on Trump. But we don’t need unverified reports to know that the relationship between the two is odd. Trump and Putin launching a mutual admiration society of sorts. Do you want to be complimented by that former KGB officer? Because Trump has refused to release his tax returns, we don’t know if he owes money to Russian oil billionaires close to Putin. Molly McKew: “the discussion in intelligence circles is that his behavior looks like someone who maybe compromised, who may be concerned about something, and nobody knows what that is, if it’s financial ties or financial leverage, something more than that, I don’t know” The only way for Trump to deal with all these conflicts of interest is to sell his companies, And then put someone besides his children in charge of the financial proceeds. Senate Democrats have introduced a bill that would require Trump to do this If this doesn’t happen, we’ll never really know whether Trump is putting the American people first, or his business interests.

124,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,TUmyygCMMGA,"A decade ago, robots still seemed pretty limited. Now, not so much. And computers don’t just win chess any more, they can win Jeopardy. “Watson.” “What is the of the Elegance of the Hedgehog?” They can win Go. “There are about 200 possible moves for the average position in Go.” This is all happening really fast. And it’s causing some to forecast a future where humans can’t find work. “There will be fewer and fewer jobs that a robot cannot do better.” “And what are the people gonna do?” “That’s the $64,000 question.” I believe this is going to be one of the biggest challenges we face in the coming decades. “People who are not just unemployed. They are unemployable.” But if you ask economists, they tend to have a pretty different view from the futurists and Silicon Valley types. Do you worry that new technologies could cause mass unemployment? Yes. No. I have devoted my career to worrying about the labor market, particularly worrying about the living standards of low and moderate income workers. So I worry a lot about things. I am not worried about this. One of the reasons a lot of economists are skeptical about robots taking all the jobs is that we’ve heard that before. There was a spike of automation anxiety in the late 20s, early 1930s when machines were starting to take over jobs on farms and also in factories. This article from 1928 points out that there used to be guards who opened and closed the doors on new york subway trains, and people who took tickets before there were turnstiles. And I just love this quote: It says “building materials are mixed like dough in a machine and literally poured into place without the touch of a human hand.” Automation anxiety surged again in the late 1950s, early 1960s. President Kennedy ranks automation first as job challenge. “Computers and automation threaten to create vast unemployment and social unrest” “What should I do Mr. Whipple?” “Stop him!” This article from 1958 is about 17,000 longshoremen who were protesting automation on the piers. And if you don't know what longshoremen are, that’s because there aren’t many of them left. Technology destroyed a lot of those jobs. And yet, we didn’t run out of work. This chart shows the percentage of prime-age people with jobs in the US. Ever since women joined the workforce in big numbers, it’s stayed around 80%, outside of recessions. During this period, technology displaced some 8 million farmers in the US, 7 million factory workers, over a million railroad workers, hundreds of thousands of telephone &nbsp;operators, we’ve lost gas-pumpers, elevator attendants, travel agents. Tons of jobs have died but work persists. What you realize when you look through those old reports is that it’s really easy for us to see the jobs being replaced by machines. It’s a bit harder to visualize the jobs that come from what happens next. New technology creates jobs in a few ways. There are the direct jobs for people who design and maintain the technology, and sometimes whole new industries built on the technology. But the part we tend to forget is the indirect effect of labor-saving inventions. When companies can do more with less, they can expand, maybe add new products or open new locations, and they can lower prices to compete. And that means consumers can buy more of their product, or if we don’t want any more of it, we can use the savings to buy other things. Maybe we go to more sports events or out to dinner more often. Maybe we get more haircuts or add more day-care for the kids. This process is how our standard of living has improved over time and it’s always required workers. The key economic logic here is automation does indeed displace workers who are doing work that got automated, but it doesn't actually affect the total number of jobs in the economy because of these offsetting effects. Warnings about the “end of work” tend to focus on this part and not all of this -- like a widely cited study from 2013, “According to research conducted by Oxford University, nearly half of all current jobs in America --” “47 percent of all our jobs--” “47 percent of US jobs in the next decade or two, according to researchers at Oxford, will be replaced by robots.” That study assessed the capabilities of automation technology. It didn’t attempt to estimate the actual “extent or pace” of automation or the overall effect on employment. Now, all this doesn’t mean that the new jobs will show up right away or that they’ll be located in the same place or pay the same wage as the ones that were lost. All it means is that the overall need for human work hasn’t gone away. Technologists and futurists don’t deny that’s been true historically, but they question whether history is a good guide of what’s to come. Fundamentally the argument is that this time it’s different. That’s what I think. Imagine a form of electricity that could automate all the routine work. I mean, that’s basically what we are talking about here. And so It’s going to be across the board. And it is easy to underestimate technology these days. In a 2004 book, two economists &nbsp;assessed the future of automation and concluded that tasks like driving in traffic would be “enormously difficult” to teach to a computer. That same year, a review of 50 years of research concluded that “human level speech recognition has proved to be an elusive goal.” And now? “Ok Google. How many miles has google’s autonomous vehicle driven?” “According to Recode, that’s because the company announced its self-driving car project, which was created in 2009, has racked up over two million miles of driving experience.” This is the textbook chart of advancement in computer hardware — it’s the number of transistors that engineers have squeezed onto a computer chip over time. Already pretty impressive, but notice that this isn’t a typical scale: these numbers are increasing exponentially. On a typical linear scale it would look more like this. It really is hard to imagine this not being massively disruptive. And as the authors of The Second Machine Age point out, processors aren’t the only dimension of computing that has seen exponential improvement. The idea of acceleration in your daily life when do you encounter that? Maybe in a car for a few seconds? In an airplane for seconds again? The idea that something can accelerate for decades literally just continuously is just not something that we deal with. I mean, we think in straight lines. But even though there’s been all this innovation, it’s not showing up in the data. If we were seeing this big increase in automation we would see productivity growing much more rapidly now than it usually does, and we are instead seeing the opposite. Labor productivity is a measure of the goods and services we produce divided by the hours that we work. Over time it goes up - we do more with less labor. We’re more efficient. If we were starting to see a ton of labor-saving innovation you’d expect this line to get steeper, but when you look at productivity growth, you can see that it has been slowing down since the early 2000s, and not just for the US. It’s possible that new technologies are changing our lives without fundamentally changing the economy. So will this all change? Will today’s robots and AI cause mass unemployment? There’s reason to be skeptical, but nobody really knows. But one thing we do know is that the wealth that technology creates, it isn’t necessarily shared with workers. When you account for inflation, the income of most families has stayed pretty flat as the economy has grown. One of the problems we've seen over the last 40 years is that we have seen all of this rising productivity growth but actually hasn't been broadly shared, it's been captured by a thin slice of people at the top of the income distribution. Even if unemployment stays low, automation might worsen economic inequality, which is already more extreme in the US than it is in most other advanced countries. But technology isn’t destiny. Governments decide how a society weathers disruptions, and that worries people on both sides of the debate about the future of work. We’ve adopted policies that instead of really trying to counteract the trend caused by technology and globalization and other things, we’ve in many cases exacerbated them. We’ve put a wind in the back of them and made them more extreme. And that’s a big problem. We will probably always be fascinated by the prospect of robots taking our jobs. But if we &nbsp;focus on things we can’t really control, we risk neglecting the things we can. "
125,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,U9wY8Wz6lCs,"In February 2015 Gucci unveiled this very furry shoe. I love this ridiculous thing. I can’t afford to spend $1000, but no problem! I can buy this knockoff. Or this one. So, which of these are legal? Trick question. And it’s a constant fight in the fashion industry. In the US, you can protect songs. “I like those Balenciaga's, the ones that look...” Movies. “That blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs…” Or paintings. Why not fashion designs? “Knockoffs” mostly are not counterfeits. People tend to conflate them but they’re not the same. This is a counterfeit. It copies the symbols of the brand that made the original. So counterfeits are typically illegal. Knockoffs, on the other hand, just resemble the design of the original. And that’s usually fine. That’s because intellectual property laws only protect some kinds of designs. A trademark is any symbol that indicates to consumers the source of products or services. This medallion on the front, which is the Tory Burch logo, tells you where the flat comes from. It comes from Tory Burch. A patent is different. A useful and novel invention. They don’t work for most fashion designers because you can’t get damages until it’s granted and by the time it's granted most fashions are out of fashion. In fashion, the main battleground is Copyright. That is the right exclusively to copy or to distribute an artistic or literary work that is original. Like… “You’re wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room.” But not... The shape of this shoe is not copyrightable. Fashion designs are typically thought of as useful articles. Copyright doesn't protect useful things. It only protects artistic or literary things. Unlike a song or a movie, a shoe or a T-shirt has utility as much as design. But… what about this? Not my thing? This might seem at a certain level to be kind of bizarre. But there is nonetheless a useful aspect to the garment. It does possibly keep you warm. Wait! It’s art! Sort of. And now… It’s a gown. You have copyright on the painting. I can certainly have a copyright on the fabric design. I can't have a copyright on the shape of the dress. The Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet will come to order. The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God. Fashion design is intellectual property that deserves protection. We create something from nothing at all. And in’t that the American dream? I don’t agree with you. But you’re very impressive in your testimony. They say, well, we're artists and we deserve protection. The answer to that argument is at least in the States we don't tend to make decisions about intellectual property based on what people deserve. We tend to make decisions based on what we think is healthy for creativity. The Constitution does give Congress the right to stop copying, but only to “promote the progress” of creative industries. When you look at countries across the world, you’ll see that there’s a correlation between the strength of intellectual property laws and higher GDP. But in fashion, Sprigman believes that it’s actually the ability to copy that promotes progress. Fashion designers take ""inspiration,"" as they put it, from existing designs and they do this with abandon. But this is what creates trends, and trends sell fashion. When the copying proceeds to a certain point, fashion forward people have had enough. They jump off. They jump on to the new trend that copying has helped to set. This rapid cycle, created by the freedom to copy, actually forces the fashion industry to innovate. If you look at the prices of fashion goods over time, what you see is that that top ten percent of fashion goods in terms of price, the price of these is going up and up and up over time. Whereas everything else, those prices are staying stable or maybe falling a little bit over time. It doesn't seem like competition from knockoffs is disciplining the price of the luxury stuff. What seems to be happening in the fashion industry is what's happening in America and indeed in the world. The rich are getting richer disproportionately, and the clothes they wear as a result are getting much more expensive. The people who make those clothes, the companies that make those clothes, are profiting. New technology and the speed of production has amplified the two views on knockoffs. Today, digital images from runway shows in New York can be uploaded to the Internet within minutes, and be copied, and offered for sale online within days, which is months before the designer is able to deliver the original garments to stores. That practice was not handed to us by God or by law. If the industry at the high end was very concerned about the speed of imitation, that practice would change. It isn’t. So it’s hard to protect fashion designs because it’s not obvious that protecting them promotes progress. And from a legal perspective, that’s all that matters. Even though to the artists, that’s not the only thing at stake. "
126,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,UdbOhvjIJxI,"In 1997, JK Rowling published Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone. But most of her audience didn’t actually read that book. They read Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s stone. or Harry Potter A L'Ecole des Sorciers Harry Potter va Sang-e Jadu Harry Potter y la Piedra Filosofal [cool humming of ""Hedwig's Theme"" ] The bewitching Harry Potter books have reached readers in over 200 territories in over 60 languages. The authorized translations came from separate publishing houses with little oversight from the author. So translators were not only tasked with adapting the text from english into their target languages and cultures, but also making assumptions about Rowling’s intentions and translating the spirit of her approach. Their task was particularly challenging because the Harry Potter series is filled with invented words, alliteration, wordplay, and British cultural references. The main characters first names: Harry, Hermione, and Ron mostly stayed the same across languages, with small changes to accommodate different alphabets and phonetics. That’s easy enough for conventional names like Harry Potter. But many of the other proper names in the book carry loaded meanings — meanings that would be lost if it’s not translated. Take Severus Snape. The name invokes severity and sounds like “snake.” So the Italian translator made the jump and named him Severus Piton —which is basically python. In French, he’s Severus Rogue which means Severus ""Arrogance"". As you can tell, both solutions sacrificed Rowling’s alliteration. The name “Hogwarts” combines two English words, but because the name stayed the same in most languages, those connotations were lost for those readers. In an attempt to preserve Rowling’s approach to the school’s name, the French translator used “Poudlard.” ""Pou du lard"" means lice of bacon or fat. The Hungarian version went with “Roxfort” a mix of the British university Oxford and Roquefort—a well known blue cheese. The house names and founders, also experienced unique adaptations in some of the target languages. In Catalan the names became: Nícanor Griffindor, Sírpentin Slytherin, Mari Pau Ravenclaw, and Horténsia Hufflepuff. There’s a ton of word play that happens in the Harry Potter books as well. The famous Diagon Alley, a play on the word ""diagonally"" and the infamous Knockturn Alley from ""nocturnally"". This type of pun is a real puzzle for translators, and most dropped it in favor of literal translations. The Spanish translator was able to rhyme at least with “callejón diagon.” And translators had several approaches to  Quidditch, an invented game made from the invented words Quaffle, Bludger, and Snitch— the 3 types of balls used in the game. In Spanish, the words were not changed. The French translator kept the word Quidditch but changed the names of the balls. And others changed the game’s name altogether. In Dutch, quidditch is “Zwerkbal.” In Norwegian, it’s “Rumpeldunk."" OWLS and NEWTS, standardized tests in the wizarding world, weren’t always able to retain their animal acronyms. But in Swedish their implied meanings remained while the wording was changed. OWLs became Grund Examen i Trollkonst or G.E.T meaning goat in Swedish. And NEWTs were changed to Fruktansvärt Utmattande Trollkarls Test or F.U.T.T. derived from ""futtig"" meaning measly or mean. The infamous anagram of Tom Marvolo Riddle’s name was altered by many translators to achieve the same revelation of “I Am Lord Voldemort.” In Danish, Tom is named ""Romeo G. Detlev Jr."" and in French he is “Tom Elvis Jedusor” which was extra clever because ""Jeu du sort"" means “fate riddle.” Culturally, the Harry Potter series is unmistakably British but translating that for a global group of readers wasn’t easy. Some food items were changed to make them less foreign for the target country. Sherbet lemons, a popular candy item in Britain, became krembo, a chocolate covered sweet from Israel. Crisps became chips in the US and in the Arabic version, bacon became eggs. Sometimes a foreign setting undergoes translation too. For the Ukrainian translation, the atmosphere of an English boarding school was swapped out for an orphanage. In the books and films, Hagrid has a provincial west country accent. Hagrid: ""No? Blimey Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?"" ""You're a wizard, Harry."" For the Japanese translations, it was replicated by using Tōhoku dialect, which is a pastoral accent from northeastern Japan. Other translators chose to have Hagrid simply speak more informally, while others dropped his accent entirely. Despite translators’ best efforts to remain true to the text some things still were lost in translation. In the mainland Chinese editions of Harry Potter there were footnotes to explain puns and cultural references. The Spanish translator sometimes used italics to signal an invented word with no translation. But in the end, it doesn’t matter if you’re reading Harry Potter and Philosopher’s Stone or the many translations of it. One thing that always seems to translate is the love fans around the world share for tales of ""The Boy Who Lived."" "

But wifi waves are fairly short. They're only 12 cm long, the conventional kind. Compare that to AM radio waves, which are hundreds of meters long. The signal gets a lot weaker as it gets further from the router. And generally they can't go more than 150 feet from a single router. They actually get absorbed and blocked by walls and metal surfaces. So the way you position your wifi router makes a huge difference in how strong your signal is throughout your house. One thing you definitely want to do is put your router near the center of your house. Because it broadcasts the signal out in equal strength in all directions. You want it out in the open. If it's in a closet, the walls of the closet are going to absorb and block some of the signal. And if you have it closed up in a cabinet, it's the same thing. A good way to think about it is just use line of sight. From whatever position you can see the furthest in your house and you can see the most number of rooms, that's probably a good place to put your router. You also want to lift your router up off the ground because the signals can't penetrate some of the materials that make up floors, like metal, or concrete, or cement. And also, the way most routers are designed, they broadcast the waves slightly downwards, so that way you're projecting less of it down into your basement for no reason. A lot of other electronics can interfere with the router's signal, things like TVs, computers, microwaves, pretty much anything that has a motor inside it. So you want to keep the router away from other electronics. Most routers have two antennas in them. Ideally you could position one vertically and one horizontally. Devices work best when their internal antenna is parallel with the router's, so most antennas inside laptops are horizontal, But if you're using a mobile device or a tablet, it totally depends on how you're holding it. So that way if you have one horizontal and one vertical, you have the highest chance of having a parallel match with antennas. If you find that your network isn't working well, you can go around and measure your signal strength. There are a lot of apps that you can download on your phone. You could create a rough map and figure out what you need to do to fix it. "
128,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,VCdTyl141bA,"This map shows the 'Black Belt' region of the United States. Its name comes from the fertile soil associated with the region. And for most of America’s history, more than 90% of the country’s largest minority group lived here. Starting in the early 20th century, nearly half of the African American population left this region to resettle in emerging Northern and Midwestern cities. It was one of the largest internal migrations in US history. And now, data indicates that a new movement is taking shape. To understand why, let’s go back to 1865. The Emancipation Proclamation ended slavery and started a new era for colored people in the states. Shortly after, the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments enfranchised people of color at large. For the first time, the majority of black Americans controlled their own destinies. In the years immediately following emancipation, most freed slaves chose to stay in their communities. After all, the only America they had known was the south. It was common for their descendants to work as sharecroppers on plantations. Sometimes their only payment was permission to live on the property. But that wasn’t the worst aspect of the south for blacks. The Jim Crow caste system determined where you could eat, what platforms you sat on when you catch a train. This was a rigid caste system where any breach could literally mean your life. That’s author &amp; journalist Isabel Wilkerson-- She spent 15 years compiling the stories of black exodus to cities in the north, midwest and west. The movement would come to be known as the Great Migration. The great migration was really a seeking of political asylum within the borders of our country. Many of them were fleeing for their lives. They were fleeing a rigid caste system known as jim crow in which everything you could and could not do was based on what you looked like. In 1915, African Americans began to leave the Black Belt for these new industrial centers. By 1929, 1.5 million African Americans had resettled in new, northern metro areas. At the time, America’s participation in World War I drove demand for manufacturing labor. But strict immigration laws left Northern factories with a shortage of workers. Factories in the north started recruiting low-skilled workers from the south. The workers faced discrimination in their new homes, which culminated in the Red Summer of 1919. Migrant blacks, whites, and european immigrants were all competing for limited housing and resources, which exacerbated relationships in city centers. The most prominent of these settlements for migrating blacks was in New York City, and the art, music and theater that emerged from this community became known as the Harlem Renaissance. These artistic achievements redefined the cultural image of blacks in America. But the stock market crash of 1929 and ensuing Great Depression slowed the influx from the South and effectively ended the first migration. A second wave began in the ‘40s when World War II kickstarted manufacturing again, while agricultural employment in the South plummeted. Once again, people living in the rural south began to migrate to cities. Manufacturing hubs in the West were far more prominent in this second movement. But only a fraction of skilled labor positions went to African-Americans. That kind of discrimination was a common experience for participants in the great migration. Throughout history, the segregated neighborhoods that southern blacks flocked to often became the ground-centers of massive racially motivated rioting. In most cases, the protesting began in response to perceived unfair treatment of the black community. This is a trend that continues today, as seen in modern violent protests in Baltimore, Ferguson, and Milwaukee. By the end of the 2nd migration, an estimated 5 to 8 million blacks had resettled outside of the south. Moving ahead to the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movements had introduced a new vision of racial identity in America. This movement’s leaders argued for the political rights and equality of all people. Meanwhile, the definition of ‘all people’ was changing. Changes in immigration policy starting in 1952 started a new era of a skills-based, multicultural immigration. This includes African migrants, adding a new black perspective to the American story. By the 1990s, a new, multicultural American identity had emerged. During this period, the rise of the black middle class was evident. You know we're used to thinking about white flight to the suburbs and black segregation, black concentration in cities. That’s the voice of William Frey. He’s been tracking the shifting demographics of America over the past 5 decades. To some degree that still exist. But there's also been a noticeable movement of blacks to the suburbs and it's fairly pervasive it's not just in two or three cities but it's and and a lot of cities across the country. Northern cities, Southern cities, Western cities. Starting in 1970 African Americans started to make this move. Especially in the last 20 or 25 years, really large numbers of blacks moved to the South. I attribute some of it to the younger generation several generations since the civil rights laws were enacted in the 1960s who now do have an opportunity to get advanced education's. At least some college. Getting that foothold into the middle class, I think is an important part of what's going on. Today, the geography established by the Great Migration is beginning to fade away. Southern states have been leaders in black population growth since the 1970’s. Still, these states have only captured a 4% increase in the share of the black population over the last 4 decades. So while we are seeing a reversal of the trend of African-American migration to cities, it’s unlikely the movement will be as far-reaching as The Great Migrations of the past. And it's because this migration is about the search for agency and opportunity -- not about fleeing violence. The stakes are not the same now as they would’ve been during the great migration. They are quite different in character and magnitude. Many of them were fleeing like refugees, and had no idea of how they would make it in this alien land.That was a watershed moment in American history, and like many watershed moments it’s hard to recreate.

She's won the French Open, the US Open, the WTA Tour Championship, and Olympic golds. And a lot of people say she's the best female player of all time. But for her entire career she's been followed by a dark cloud of racism and sexism. The first instance a lot of fans will remember was the 2001 tournament in Indian Wells California. Serena and her sister Venus were booed by fans who accused them of match fixing Keep in mind that tennis fans are typically well-behaved. Then, according to the Williams family, things got worse. Serena said she heard people shouting the n-word. And then she heard someone tell her to ""go back to Compton."" What's crazy is that even after that first incident these comments didn't stop. And it's not just racial slurs. A lot of the language used to praise Williams' skill is also based in racial stereotypes. Example: Peter Larkins, a sports doctor in Australia, tried to explain Williams' win by saying ""it's the African-American race. They just have this huge gluteal strength... with Serena, that's her physique and genetics."" She's had to deal with a ton of bizarre scrutiny of her body that taps into the politics of racism and sexism. For some commentators that has meant stripping her of her femininity. the President of the Russian Tennis Federation infamously called the Williams sisters ""brothers."" Others have sexualized her body. One writer decided he should comment on the size of her breasts. Another said that her butt was bigger than he preferred. There was even this incident in 2012 where Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki mocked Williams' body by stuffing her top and tennis skirt with towels at an exhibition match. People have also linked her sexualization to that a a woman who was called the Hottentot Venus Her name was Sarah Baartman and she was an African woman who was put on display basically as a freak show exhibit for Europeans. Unlike most other tennis stars, Williams' incredible career has been surrounded by racism and sexism. And that's why her wins often feel like victories over these things as much as over her opponents. "
130,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,VnfKgffCZ7U,"You may think you know exactly what race you are, but how would you prove it if somebody disagreed with you? The fact is, even though race drives a lot of social and political outcomes, race isn't real. One of the first people to attempt to categorize humans according to race was a german scientist in around 1776. He came up with 5 different groups according to physical appearance and geographic origin of their ancestors. American's of European descent eagerly bought into this type of thinking around the same time. Some historians have said the idea that there are different races helped them resolve the contradiction between a natural right to freedom and the fact of slavery. If whites were their own distinct category, then they could feel a lot better about denying freedom to people who they labeled black and decided were fundamentally different. But as political priorities change, definitions of race in America adjust right along with them. For example, if were of Mexican birth or ancestry in the United States in 1929, you were considered white. Then, the 1930 census changed that to non-white to limit immigration. Later, when the US needed to increase its labor force during World War II, these people were switched back to white. And what it took to be ""black"" once varied so widely throughout the country, from one quarter, to one sixteenth, to the infamous ""One drop"" of African ancestry, that people could actually change races just by crossing state lines. Then, suddenly, in 2000, the government decided that Americans could be more than one race and added a multi-racial category to the census. This has left many Americans scratching their heads when it comes to selecting who they are. As many as 6.2% of census respondents selected ""Some other race"" in the 2010 survey. The idea that someone might look one way, and identify another way, or that they might be really hard to place in a racial category, is not new. This is why there was a public debate about whether MSNBC's Karen Finney could say she was black, or how we can't even agree on the racial label assigned to the President of the United States. Of course many people feel their racial identity is very clear and very permanent, but the fact that some people have changed theres, and that nobody can really argue with them, shows how shaky the very idea of race is. This is all because there isn't a race chromosome in our DNA that people can point to. It simply doesn't exist. When the medical community links race to health outcomes, it's really just using race as a substitute for other factors, such as where your ancestors came from, or the experiences of people who may have been put in the same racial group as you. Dorothy Roberts explains that sickle-cell anemia is a prime example of this. The disease is linked to areas with high rates of malaria, which includes some parts of Europe and Asia in addition to Africa. It's not actually about race at all. This of course does not mean that the concept of race isn't hugely important in our lives. The racial categories to which we're assigned can determine real life experiences, they can drive political outcomes, and they can even make the difference between life and death. But understanding that racial categories are made up can give us an important perspective on where racism came from in the first place. "

The uninsured rate in the United States is at an all-time low. Having coverage has become just as common as wearing a seatbelt. Obamacare is a crucial part of President Obama’s legacy — but that is all about to change. President-elect Trump and Congressional Republicans have promised to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with something else. ""Immediately repealing and replacing the disaster known as Obamacare"" Economic estimates predict that this will lead to anywhere from 3 to 21 million Americans losing health coverage, depending on which plan Republicans pick. Republicans have attacked Obamacare viciously. ""Obamacare isn't working, and it never will. "" ""This law is hurting families in America"" Some of the problems they point out are quite real. About half of Obamacare enrollees say that their deductibles and premiums are too high. Premiums on the Obamacare marketplace went up 22 percent last year. Will Republicans fix those problems? Or will they make them worse?

132,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Wp4fKplfGRc,"Since the end of World War Two, the world has been built on an idea called deterrence. It says if you attack me or my allies, I'll retaliate, so we're both better off not fighting. It's why the Cold War stayed cold, and why there hasn't been a war between major powers in 70 years. It's kept the world stable. It's the reason we still have nuclear weapons —&nbsp;and the reason we haven't used them since 1945. But deterrence is changing. New forms of warfare are blurring the old lines and rewriting the old rules.So I went to ask Secretary of Defense Ash Carter what this means for the world and for the US. He said the stakes are high, and that the military's challenge will be to establish new norms of deterrence to convince America's adversaries that the old rules still hold. It has the word ""terror"" inside it, right? ""Deterrence."" That's what it's about, is you scare someone away from doing something you don't want them to do by making them fear the consequences. To do that, they must know what the consequences are, and you're right, it needs to be understood. There needs to be some sort of normality to the idea that this threat will be offered and it should deter. As we get into new domains, like cyber and space, and we try to situate old and very solid ideas like deterrence in those new domains, it requires some thought. The old rules of deterrence set hard, clear lines for what would trigger a military retaliation, and those lines usually fall across b orders. But no one knows how or where to draw that sort of line when it comes to things like cyber attacks. In the physical world, it's easy to tell when you're under attack by a foreign military, but not so online. In 2013, for example, hackers based in Iran accessed the control system for a small dam in New York state, but it took months for US investigators to accuse the Iranian government of being behind it. The hackers didn't cause any physical damage, but they could have, and it raised questions — which are still unanswered — about when a hack becomes like a military attack, and when and how the US is obligated to respond. If you attack us in cyber space, it's an attack. I'm very straightforward. An attack is an attack. We won't necessarily respond in space, or respond in cyber, we may respond in some other way, but we will respond and you need to understand that: that if you're attacking American interests, there will be a response. But it's important to communicate that fact, that you're prepared for it, we know exactly what we're going to do, and you will regret the consequences of your act and you should be fearful of those consequences and thus not do it in the first place. The threat isn't just that new tools of warfare like cyber attacks let countries get away with things they normally couldn't. In regular war, we have what are called norms of proportionality. You bomb me, I bomb you back. But tools like cyber are so new, there are no norms yet. No one knows what sort of response to expect, and Carter says this can be dangerous. Proportionality does mean if you do something, I'm going to do something back to you, but I'm not necessarily going to do something that's out of proportion and that makes it necessary for you then to do more, and more, and more. That's called escalation, obviously nobody wants that. The US, he says, has to have responses strong enough to make any adversary stand down — but not so strong that it could make the other country feel obligated to respond, which is how things could spiral out of control. So whenever we think about deterrence responses, we craft them in such a way that they are not by themselves intentionally or unintentionally escalatory. We always have retained the capability to escalate still further, that's part of deterring the next move. But it's not our intention, in general, to escalate something. It's to stop it from ever occurring in the first place, and if it does occur, to punish it quickly, which makes the opponent say, ""Okay, I realize my mistake. I stand down from my objectives,"" and then it's the end of it. But it's not just cyber war. Russia is developing new postmodern techniques known as hybrid war. Special forces dressed up as vigilantes. Attacks meant to create chaos more than seize territory. Propaganda and misinformation meant to spark panic or even popular unrest. Deterrence works on certainty —&nbsp;who is doing what, and what actions will spark retaliation. But hybrid war is about creating uncertainty. It makes it harder to determine who's doing what, and blurs the lines between what is and isn't war. And, like with cyber war, the rules of hybrid war are still unclear. Carter says the way to deal with that is by keeping lines of communication open so that both side can control any misunderstanding or escalation before it gets out of control. It's very important to keep dialogue, even with potential enemies. That's why I believe, among many other things, very strongly in military-to-military dialogue and dialogue between me and my counterparts. You can't stop a conflict that your enemy deliberately provokes, but you can try to prevent ones that they blunder into by underestimating you. One of the ways you do that is by signaling clearly and having dialogue. Are you satisfied with the level of military-to-military communication with Russia and China? No, I'd like to see more in general, but it takes two to tango. It's not just the amount, it's the character of the dialogue and the willingness of those parties to have a dialogue of a kind that we would regard as fruitful. That's not everything that it should be. In the last year of the Obama administration, Carter has been arguing that the American military needs to prepare for a new era of great power competition, primarily with Russia and with China. That means an era where deterrence is even more important. And that deterrence, ultimately, is backed up by nuclear weapons. My bedrock of this department here is our commitment to nuclear security, and also to deterrence in our nuclear arsenal. It's not in the headlines every day, and thank goodness for that, but it's in the back of my mind every day. The US has about 7,100 nuclear weapons, of which about 1,500 are deployed. Russia has about the same. Combined, that's 90% of all nuclear weapons. They mainly exist to never to be used —&nbsp;to deter other nuclear states. But there's a strange logic to this: to make sure we never have to use them, we need to credibly threaten to use weapons that would kill millions and send the world into nuclear winter. To ask you about that deterrence, there's a story that I love from when Dick Cheney had your job. In 1989, he was getting a briefing on US nuclear war plans, and there was a slide that came up for retaliatory strike plans for Moscow. One of the things it showed was, I think it was something like 70 strikes on one radar facility in some suburb of Moscow. He turned to his aides and he said, ""What the hell is this? Why are we doing this kind of thing?"" The reason I bring that up is I think that's the reaction a lot of people have when they are confronted with the logic of nuclear deterrence, and they see its ends. What do you tell people when they have that reaction? &nbsp;I do, I hear it all the time. You never get quite used to how terrible such a situation would be. But until someone has an alternative to deterrence as dealing with someone who might use nuclear weapons against you — and we haven't found, in all those years since the Manhattan Project, any effective defense against nuclear weapons — until those are found, the only defense we have is the threat of retaliation. As the lines of deterrence blur, what does that mean for nuclear weapons? The US plans to spend $1 trillion on modernizing its nuclear weapons, and Russia is making upgrades as well. Carter says this is about maintaining the status quo, a balance between the nuclear powers that keeps them away from conflict. But he acknowledges that this carries some risk. Do you ever want to use it? Of course not. That's the whole purpose, is never to use it. Thank goodness in all these decades since 1945, a nuclear weapon has not been used in anger since then. That's a remarkable achievement. But it's one I don't take for granted. But with the growing uncertainty about what does and doesn't triggers retaliation, and about what kind of retaliation to expect, I asked Carter whether he worried that an unintended escalation to war could happen. He said the answer was for the US military to replace that uncertainty with as much certainty as it could bring. We have awesome power in our military. We're not eager to use it, and we hope it causes others not to do provocative things, but if they do, I don't have any doubt that we will prevail. We certainly think through every scenario that is possible and make sure that we have plans that provide for the most sensible thing we could do at the time with the capabilities we have. That's what we're here for. That's a world where stability and peace come from making everyone certain about exactly when and how the US will use military force. But there's no such thing as perfect certainty, especially when the technology and norms of war are changing so quickly. America's challenge will be to constantly create new norms, and clarify new lines of deterrence, to keep pace with those changes. It's a different role than we're used to, but one that we'll need to learn quickly. "
133,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Wx_2SVm9Jgo,"I'm on an island near the North Pole and I'm here to find out who owns the Arctic. As the ice melts more and more in this region, you can see just how dramatic the ice has been shrinking. One of these countries has shown that they're willing to fight for it. Russia's making a new push into the Arctic. This is the Wild West. Investment opportunities opening up in sort of an unusual area: the Russian Arctic. The Arctic region has strategic and economic importance. The pace of melting is only getting faster. Russia projecting its power. Use diplomacy to avoid further conflict in the High North. So, I'm not allowed to take my camera down into the mine. So I've been given this explosion-proof super fortified camera. In case it explodes, it won't cause a death fire for the entire community. This coal mine is owned by the Russian government, it's in a town with Russian flags, and the bust of a Russian Communist revolutionary, Vladimir Lenin. But, this isn't Russia. It's Barentsburg, on the island of Svalbard near the North Pole. It's a place that exists for strategic reasons, not for making money. In fact it loses money. Has for decades. Russia funds this place because for them, it means influence in this region. A frozen ocean, that is melting more and more every year due to the changing climate. This is what the Arctic Ocean looked like in September 1984. Fast-forward thirty two years and this is what it looks like: September 2016. Most of the world sees this as a looming disaster, but for the Arctic nations this change means an opportunity: Access to a brand new ocean. Here's what geologists think oil and gas resources might look like in the Arctic. The US Geological Survey estimates that the region holds 30 percent of the world's undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its oil. These resources are still remote and costly to access but they're more accessible every year and suddenly this desolate region is very interesting to the world. New shipping routes are also opening up and this ocean, that was once frozen, is now navigable for longer periods every summer, cutting weeks off the trips between Asian and Western markets. The topic of borders in the Arctic region is a little bit complex and it's an issue that's still open for discussion and negotiation. Currently the border lines in the Arctic Ocean look like this. Every country gets their default maritime borders that are 200 nautical miles off their coast. The rest of the water that doesn't fall within these exclusive economic zones, is up for grabs to anyone who can prove that it belongs to them. And that has a lot to do with a continental shelf. A continental shelf is a part of a country's landmass. It's just covered with ocean. The continental shelf continues until it drops off into the deeper parts of the ocean. Since the ice has been melting, countries have been sending out submarines to gather data on the continental shelf. They put together a scientific case and submit it to a UN committee. This committee reviews it and decides whether or not the country's claim is scientifically valid. Extending from our coastlines, lying beneath the sea, is an extension of our country called the continental shelf. It determines the new borders of our country. Knowing where the edge of the continental shelf lies, adds millions of square kilometers to our country and makes the resources on the seafloor and beneath the seabed, Canada's. So far Norway and Iceland are the only two nations whose continental shelf claims have been submitted and approved by the UN, but others have submitted claims that are waiting for approval. Look at Russia's claims versus that of Greenland, the large Arctic island that actually belongs to Denmark. The claims overlap significantly. Canada is in the process of gathering data and is expected to submit a claim that will also have some overlap here. The UN committee that evaluates these claims is made up of scientists, not diplomats. Their sole job is to say whether or not the claim is scientifically valid. It's then up to the countries to negotiate how to work out who gets what. Russia has shown its interest in having a claim that extends all the way to the North Pole. In 2007 Russia went so far as to plant its flag on the seafloor under the North Pole. And if push comes to shove, Russia likely won't concede its North Pole claim to the tiny nation of Denmark, whose claims overlap with theirs. Russia is easily the biggest player in the Arctic neighborhood. Half of the Arctic is flanked by Russian coast and they easily wield the most influence and they have the most to gain from global warming and the ice melting. And so they're refortifying and renovating a lot of their strategic outposts here in the Arctic. 50 airfields by 2020, putting special forces. They're training, holding military exercises in the Arctic. In recent years Russia has been reopening, fortifying, and building new military bases in the Arctic region. They've been publicizing their military exercises, which include reindeer, huskies, and soldiers in uniforms that look like they belong in a Star Wars film. Russia is sending us important signals, that in the Arctic, they will project their own power and capabilities and I don't see a sufficient response from the US and NATO, to recognize that increased military position. One of those outposts is the town of Barentsburg, which is right behind me, here on the island of Svalbard. Barentsburg isn't a military facility, like all those other dots on the map, but it serves a similar purpose. And to understand why Russia wants a town on this island, you have to understand Svalbard. It's unlike any other piece of land on earth and not only because it's the northernmost inhabited part of the planet. The Svalbard treaty, signed in 1920, says that any country who has signed the treaty can have its people on Svalbard and exploit the land for commercial or economic purposes. The land technically belongs to Norway, but 45 countries have signed the treaty and so 45 countries have economic claim to this land. The one rule is that no nation, including Norway, is allowed to have military assets on Svalbard. So Russia set up a coal mine up here, not to make money. Russia pays for these coal miners to be here to sink economic roots into this land. If there's ever dispute about boundaries or if oil is someday found off the shores of Svalbard, Russia will be at the table where those discussions are happening and Barentsburg will be their bargaining chip. It's their claim to this land. What's most fascinating to me, is that this strategy plays out with people. The people living here in Barentsburg are effectively placeholders for a Russian strategy for the Arctic. And yet when you talk to them that's not really on their mind. They're not thinking about geopolitics, they're not thinking about the changing landscape of the Arctic, and what that means for Russian policy. For Russia, coal has been their main economic activity, it's what they've been doing here for years, but coal is in decline and their operation is slowly losing people and interest and so they're realizing they have to pivot to a different economic activity, that is more sustainable for the future. And for them the answer is tourism. On Svalbard, it's kind of clear: the coal mining era, is something which is, you know, disappearing. It's a bust. Tourism, science, nature protection is its future. You can see Russia's renewed interest in this island taking place when you walk around the town of Barentsburg. The consulate is undergoing some renovation right now. They're like gutting the whole thing and renovating after years of neglect. It's a small village of a few hundred people and it has an entire consulate. This consulate serves more as a statement than a functional asset for the Russian government. All these renovations suggest that they expect this ghost town to become a major tourist destination, but making money isn't the motivation here. Of course it's impossible that Barentsburg one day will support itself without any funding from the government. It's impossible. The pivot to tourism isn't just about keeping deep economic roots in Barentsburg. It also serves a purpose of turning Barentsburg into a spectacle, for people to see just how much Russian identity is tied to the Arctic. Newly refurbished buildings, new Arctic theme bars, museums that tell the story of Russian presence in the Arctic. These aren't military bases or airfields, but this sort of projection of culture and identity goes a long way in creating association with a place, in exerting influence. It's called soft power. Funding all of this on a faraway island that belongs to Norway, is the epitome of soft power. And it's a perfect complement to Russia's surge in hard power in the Arctic. Remember all those dots? The most long-range air patrols with bear bombers since the Cold War, forty five thousand troops,  three thousand four hundred military vehicles, forty one ships, fifteen submarines, and a hundred and ten aircraft. What do you think Russia's trying to achieve in the Arctic with that massive military buildup? I don't know. I believe, however, that we are going  to have to figure it out. But up until now Russia has been playing by the rules on the maritime borders front. Following all the UN protocol and making claims in a very orderly fashion, but they've also shown some provocative behavior in protecting their influence in the region. On the one hand for Russia to benefit economically from the Arctic, it has to be a stable cooperative environment. The best thing you can do to spook off companies and economic investment, is to think that the region could be prone to conflict. But we have to remember that this is the government that annexed Crimea a few years ago. It's a government that's not afraid to project power in its neighborhood. They're showing us both tracks, sort of this dual policy of wanting to be open for business, but be able to growl a little bit and show its muscular teeth for its military and those two, eventually they're a little incompatible. This region is changing fast. The treaties and norms that have kept it in order for years are becoming incompatible with the physical realities. As the ice melts, the region will become more valuable. New borders will be drawn, and new opportunities to project power will emerge. We can only hope that Russia continues to  play by the rules. My favorite part about being in the Arctic while I was making this story, was going on these late night hikes. A lot of the footage in this video was shot after midnight, when the sun would kind of just hover around the horizon. The light would be beautiful for hours at a time. And it was just such a crazy experience to watch the sun never set. Anyway, thanks for watching the second episode of Borders, I published the first episode last week. And I'm going to continue to publish these every week, on Tuesdays. I also want to say a big thank you to lululemon, who is a sponsor of Borders. They sent me these ABC pants, which are these sturdy pants are used for both active hiking, as well as just kind of lounging around. They're super comfortable. Thank you lululemon for sending me these ABC pants, but more importantly thanks for supporting Borders, and for making this whole thing happen. If you want to check out these ABC pants, I'm going to leave a link here, where you can go over to the lulu shop online, and check them out for yourself. That's it, stay tuned: one week from now, I'm releasing the next episode of Borders. "
134,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Wy8iiC2Mqso,"The Ninth Circuit is a disaster. Nobody can believe these decisions we’re getting from the Ninth Circuit, it’s a disgrace. The Ninth Circuit — everybody knows it — it's totally out of control. When Trump took office, most of the Ninth Circuit’s judges had been appointed by Democratic presidents. And they overruled some of Trump’s most provocative executive orders: The travel ban, emergency funding for a border wall, they all stopped here. It's very hard to win at the Ninth Circuit, if not impossible. But that’s changing. Trump has already added seven new judges to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and by the end of his first term there’s a good chance the Ninth Circuit could look very different. We usually think of the three branches of government as the president, Congress, and the Supreme Court. But it’s here, in the federal courts, where President Trump is building his longest-lasting legacy. You know, when I got in, we had over 100 federal judges that weren’t appointed. It was like a big, beautiful present to all of us. Federal courts hear lawsuits involving the Constitution or laws made by Congress. Say a city pays a female employee less than her male counterpart — that violates the Equal Pay Act, a federal law. So that case would start here, where all federal lawsuits start, in a District Court. There’s at least one in every state. For example, California is home to 61 judges who serve on the state’s four District Courts. If the case is appealed, it moves up to the aptly named Court of Appeals. It’s made up of 13 Circuit Courts, and they each hear cases from different parts of the country. So a case that started in California will move up to the Ninth Circuit Court, because they hear cases from the western part of the US. If it’s appealed again, it’ll go to the Supreme Court. But they only hear less 100 cases a year. The Circuit Courts? They hear 50,000. For most federal cases, these judges give the final, precedent-setting ruling. They’re kind of a big deal. And every single judge here is nominated by the president and serves for life. Now here’s a chart showing how many Circuit Court judges a president confirmed, by what time in their presidency. There’s Ronald Reagan’s. And this is George H. W. Bush’s. Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. All pretty consistent, right? Now here’s Barack Obama’s. Look how it totally flatlines in his last two years. That’s because all federal judges are nominated by the president but then have to be confirmed by a vote in the Senate. And after the 2014 election, Republicans gained control in the Senate and Mitch McConnell stopped holding votes on nearly all of Obama’s court picks. From the Supreme Court all the way down to the District Courts. So when Trump took office, not only did he have a ton of vacant seats to fill, he had a Republican-controlled Senate to help fill them. Quickly. In fact, Trump has appointed more Circuit Court judges in the first half of his first term than any other modern president. But his judges are different. This is where all the judges nominated by each president fall on a scale between liberal and conservative, determined by their past political donations. Here’s the median score for those judges. You can see that appointees on both sides have moved further to the left and right of their party’s medians. But Trump’s median pick is more conservative than Obama’s was liberal. And more conservative than his Republican predecessors’. And if you look at the ideological distribution of judges appointed by previous presidents, you can see tails at either end. Both Republican and Democratic presidents appointed some judges that leaned the other way. But Trump? Not really. Traditionally, presidents need to work with the Senate. If a judgeship opens up in, say, Texas, the nominee would need the approval of the Texas senators. No approval, no vote. It makes presidents compromise with the opposite party and prevents them from stacking the courts with super-partisan judges. That’s why these past presidents had to have a spectrum of judges. But when Trump nominated two men for seats on the Ninth Circuit — the court that keeps overturning Trump’s executive orders — the two Democratic senators from California opposed them both, calling them “far outside the judicial mainstream.” One because of some controversial writings in college and the other because of his prior work as a defense lawyer, including for oil companies where he argued climate change isn’t real. Normally this would mean they would never get a vote, let alone a hearing. But Republicans aren’t honoring this century-old informal rule, and judges are being confirmed without the support of either home-state senator. Including those two on the Ninth. Trump has now appointed seven new judges to the Ninth Circuit: one because Obama’s nominee wasn’t allowed a vote and four without the approval of home-state senators. He’s expected to appoint at least two more judges before his first term is over. This is what the Circuit Courts looked like when Trump became president at the beginning of 2017. And here’s how the courts look halfway through 2019. It’s expected that every president gets to have an impact on the federal courts. That’s normal. But Trump only got to fill these seats because of McConnell’s refusal to hold a vote on Obama’s picks. None of these Trump picks had the support of both senators from their home state. And as a group, Trump’s picks are more conservative than his Republican predecessors’. In 2018, Mitch McConnell laid out his goals for the federal judiciary in a radio interview. And his plan is working. "
135,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,XaR5kR8h4es,"When we think about sanctuary cities, we tend to imagine, depending on our political view, either lawless cesspools where federal law is utterly ignored; pretty much the definition of anarchy human sacrifices, rapes, murders, Satan worshippers American lives are being lost they are breaking the law, they are harboring fugitives this is absolutely nuts or havens for one of the nation's most marginalized groups. You are safe in Chicago. This is about human beings, families. and will continue to be a place of refuge But, in reality, neither of those descriptions quite fit. And to understand why, you have to put yourself in the shoes of a local police officer. These policies are different in different places. In Chicago, it means city employees aren't supposed to share residents immigration status with other people. In Washington DC, it means police officers are barred from asking residents about their immigration status. But often, it comes down to this: how does the local police officer handle an unauthorized immigrant that he's already arrested for some other reason? Let's say a cop pulls someone over for speeding. The cop notices this person has an unpaid speeding ticket, and they missed their day in court. So, the cop arrests the person, books them into the local jail. While they wait for someone to post bail, the person gets fingerprinted. That's part of the booking process. Those fingerprints then get sent to an FBI database, and then a database kept by Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE. That step is mandatory. Whether or not a city calls itself a sanctuary city, it still has to send those fingerprints through the FBI database. If the fingerprints match up with someone who ICE knows is an unauthorized immigrant, they might send the local cops holding this person something called a detainer request. The detainer request is just that: it's a request. The federal government is asking, not demanding, that police hold that person for an extra 48 hours after they would normally be released. That gives ICE time to come by, pick them up, start the deportation process. Now, ICE can't force local law enforcement to hold someone and just by sending one of these detainer requests. The Constitution's Tenth Amendment prohibits state governments from having to enforce federal law. And some federal courts have decided that detainer requests fall into that category. So, if you're a local police chief or sheriff, and you get one of these requests, you have a choice. Do you honor the request? Or do you let the person go? Let's say you honor the request and keep the person in jail for an extra 48 hours. Ice comes to pick them up, and they get deported. Word gets out around the immigrant community: any time you interact with local police, it could mean deportation. Eventually, immigrants will be afraid to call the police, even when they're the victims of crime, or the witnesses to it. And then, immigrants become easy targets. Because the bad guys know that many immigrants will not call the police. For a local police chief, this is a big problem. It's impossible to do their jobs when they don't have people's trust. Five hundred thousand Angelenos, people who live in Los Angeles, are undocumented immigrants. I need their cooperation. I need them work with their local police stations. I need them to be witnesses to violent crime. What about the other option? What happens if you ignore the order, and let this person go home? First, there's no guarantee that they won't get deported anyway. Whether a city considers itself a sanctuary or not, local law enforcement can't stop ICE from deporting someone. Think of the levels of government like rungs on a ladder. You have the federal government at the top level; that includes agencies like ICE. You have the state government: governors, legislatures, in the middle. And then, at the bottom, you have local government: mayors, police chiefs, sheriffs. If the federal government issues a detainer request, and the local police department refuses to accept it, the state government can step in by taking away one of the state funding streams from the local police. That's what happened in Texas in 2017. The governor of the great state of Texas, Greg Abbott, has declared he will sign a law banning sanctuary cities. He's already issued an order that cuts funding to those sanctuary cities. This is dangerous and I will not allow it as governor of Texas. This map shows the counties in red that always cooperate with ICE, and the ones that don't; those are an orange, yellow, and green. The green counties have the most restrictions on when they cooperate with ICE detainer requests. In late January 2017, shortly after he got into office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order that opens the door to withholding federal funds from sanctuary cities or counties. The wording of that order is vague, and it's already being challenged in federal court. But if Trump's plan does move forward, it could put local law enforcement officers across the country in a lose-lose situation. For them, deciding whether to honor a detainer request is often about choosing between financial security on one hand, and public safety on the other. you "
136,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Xs87FijgVaA,"This is the first live cat recorded on film, and it’s being dropped to solve a physics problem: Why do cats always land on their feet? It’s a question that was driving 19th-century scientists nuts. Until one of them used an unexpected tool to solve the mystery: a camera. Étienne-Jules Marey was an obsessive scientist and inventor who analyzed how things moved. And he started experimenting with photography at a time when the medium was mostly used to document static subjects. But his goal was to capture motion. And he did that by building on a basic principle of photography: exposing a photosensitive material to light and then covering it in darkness. So his way of creating this darkness and light was to have a disc with slots in it. By controlling the light as the subject moved across the frame, Marey was able to record movement onto a single glass plate. Essentially, all he does is block that light intermittently. A slot from the disc opens, and then there’s darkness as the man moves, opens, darkness. This technique is called chronophotography, and the results show something human eyes will never see on their own: individual stages of motion. A couple of years later, Kodak introduced celluloid film and Marey updated his slot camera in a crucial way. He swapped the single glass plate with a roll of film that moved in between exposures. So, light: an image is made. Darkness, the film moves on. Light, an image — so it’s a movie camera, is what it is. Marey made a lot of films for research purposes, and even tried dropping other animals to see if they’d land on their feet, specifically this rabbit and this chicken. Which brings us back to the cat. It seems to be able to right itself by flipping in the air without pushing off anything first, which would contradict the law of conservation of angular momentum. Sounds scary, but stick with me here. One of Newton’s laws of motion says that something in motion can’t just stop itself unless an opposing force acts upon it. Basically, you can’t just change direction midair, Wile E. Coyote style. But to the naked eye, it looks like a cat can. Most people assumed the cat was “cheating” by kicking off the hands of the person dropping it, but Marey’s film showed what’s actually happening. The first few frames prove right away that the cat doesn’t start its rotation from a kick. But what it does do is arch its back. And by arching its back, it’s divided its body into a front part and a back part, and the two parts can work independently. You know how a figure skater pulls their arms in to rotate faster? That’s what’s happening here too. Early in the rotation, the cat pulls its front legs in and leaves the back splayed out so the front half can rotate quickly while the back half stays relatively still. Then halfway through, it does the opposite. Front legs stretched out, back ones tucked in to flip the other half of its body around. And you notice by the time the cat is landing, all four legs are stretched out as far as they can be, which means slow rotation. So the cat has rotated itself, but not overall; the two halves are working in opposite ways. It uses the inertia of its own bodyweight to spin each side. And because the two spins operate separately in opposing directions, they cancel each other out. So Newton’s law isn’t broken. Marey published his findings in Nature in 1894, breaking down the falling cat problem for the first time. His work remains an early example of using photography for scientific discovery. What does photography do for science? It records something and it makes it permanent so you can analyze it later, or so you can share it. But what Marey did was show something that the eye could not possibly see — ever. You might have seen another famous early example of motion photography: In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge used 12 cameras connected to tripwires to prove that a horse lifts all four feet off the ground at some point in a gallop.

137,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,XwNUmnDu1r8,"In the mid-1970’s, Erno Rubik invented the Rubik’s cube. But that doesn’t mean knew how to solve it. It took him a few moths  to figure it out. By the time the first World Rubik’s Cube Championships were held in 1982, The winner -- he could solve the cube in a little less than 23 seconds. And these days? [news montage of collin’s record] This is world record holder Collin Burns, and today, we find out how he did it. [TITLES] “It could last another day; it could last another few years. The previous record lasted for just over 2 years. But with single solve, especially, you just need to get lucky. Or at least that’s a big part of it.” Collin tends to downplay his skills but it’s worth noting there are two types of world records. The way speedcubing competitions work is that volunteers scramble the cubes according to instructions that are generated by a computer, so competitors all get the same scramble. They do 5 solves and their three middle scores are averaged. So Collin holds the world record for a single solve. But the world record for an average score is held by a 19-year-old in Australia. Still, Collin’s record is a huge deal. At the competition where we met up with him, kids were asking him for his autograph. He’s now being sponsored by a cube company and by a cube retailer, which are paying for him to travel internationally. And he wants people to know, you could do this too. “The biggest misconception about cubing is that it’s difficult, which it really isn’t.” Pop culture treats the Rubik’s cube like some sort of IQ test, but it’s not. At least not anymore. “Generally average is much more impressive because you have to be consistently fast.” Still, Collin’s record is a huge deal. At the competition where we met up with him, other kids were asking him for autographs. “are you that famous cube guy?” I recently bought a cube online and it came with instructions for beginners. And if you memorize those, you can solve the cube in a couple minutes. It helps to understand the design of the puzzle. At first glance, it looks like a cube made out of cubes — right, three layers of nine. But if you look closer, you’ll see there aren’t actually any cubes here. So that tells you that the corners will always be corners, the edges will always be edges, and the middle pieces determine the color of that face. Speedcubers will buy special cubes. They can lubricate them and adjust the tension. But the real key to their speed is efficiency - they’re looking several moves ahead, and they use fewer moves to get the same result. So there are 43 quintillion possible arrangements for the cube. A few years back, some researchers borrowed computing power from Google to find out that any scramble can be solved in 20 moves or less. They call it God’s Number. But humans just aren’t that good. The beginners’ method that I learned uses 100 to 200 moves. Speedcubers use more around 50 to 60 moves. And they can do that, in part, because of the knowledge gained by the previous generation of speedcubers. When the cube first spread around the world back in the 80s, people had to learn through trial and error. This was happening in a lot of math departments and campus clubs. People were discovering the cube at the same time, and they were sharing what they learned. The method Collin uses was developed by Jessica Fridrich, an engineering professor who was a college student at the time. It starts with a cross on one of the faces. And that face becomes the bottom layer. Then what they do is solve the corners of the bottom layer and the middle layer simultaneously. “So, now you can see that all of this is solved.” And for the final layer, they’re choosing from dozens of algorithms that they’ve memorized. And those are sequences of moves that mess up the cube temporarily to move certain pieces into place. And then put the rest of the cube back where it was. The Rubik’s cube has made a comeback in recent years along with that same ethic of sharing tips and strategies. So all the resources you need are there, there’s just one other thing. Practice! This is Collin nearly 5 years ago. world records are not built in a day. "

But lesser known is this map over here – where things get tricky. ""So does becoming a business owner mean you have to check your convictions at the door?"" ""Right now the state of Michigan does not include sexual orientation and gender identity in its law"" ""I'm just really nervous"" ""I actually have something important to talk to you about today."" The fact is, in most states, it's still currently legal to fire LGBTQ people, kick them out of a store or business that serves the public, or evict them from housing because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. ""The ayes are 49, the nos are 50, the bill is not agreed to."" Often it's as subtle as a boss picking another job application. Or a landlord denying rent, without explanation. These are the rights protected by the civil rights act of 1964. ""My fellow Americans... those who founded our country knew that freedom would be secure only if each generation fought to renew and enlarge its meaning."" Following the passage of the Civil Rights Act, federal and state laws prohibit this type of discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex and national origin. This is called Enumeration. If you list the characteristics that are most often the subject of discrimination it removes any doubt that those people are protected. ""Since these early days, I have seen and I have experienced many other types of discrimination, and all of them were rooted in the fear of people that were different from the majority."" But sexual orientation and gender identity are not enumerated in most states and a report by the Human Rights Campaign found that lawmakers in 29 states have actually proposed bills that would actively discriminate against LGBTQ people. ""We have what's called a patchwork of civil rights protections on this issue in this country."" Sam Brownback, the governor of Kansas, went so far as to write an executive order to reverse a measure that barred employment discrimination against LGBTQ people. On top of all of this, there’s systematic discrimination in many schools throughout the country. ""Ellen Degeneres has been speaking out, voicing her outrage about the cruelty that spiraled out of control in our schools and beyond."" ""Today is October 20th, 2013. Hopefully today will be a big day of my life. In a positive way."" The states in red here have “no promo homo” laws that forbid teachers in public schools from even mentioning homosexuality at all. ""If you are reading this, it means that I have committed suicide. Those words written on a warren country teenager's tumblr page, and now sparking an outcry from the LGBTcommunity tonight."" That's where coming out videos on YouTube like Drew's and Adam's are so helpful. ""So I have something serious I want to talk to you about."" ""Yeah, I like guys."" ""I have to tell you that I'm gay. Always have been, always will be."" ""And do you know how I drew that in 7th grade, and how in 7th grade I wanted to kill myself? It's been something that I've not liked for a while. Especially when people call me fag a lot."" ""There are too many kids out there suffering from bullying, rejection, or simply being mistreated because of who they are."" And there's proof that enumeration works. GLSEN, an organization that advocates for LGBTQ students, says students who go to school with enumerated LGBTQ policies experience significantly lower levels of bullying. ""Federal investigators are looking into accusations that Minnesota's largest school district discriminates against gay students following 7 student suicides in fewer than 2 years."" These are laws that save lives. 2012 was the first year in US History where more people supported same-sex marriage than people who didn't. ""I know I'm kind of destroying every hope and dream you ever had for me..."" ""No! Not at all."" 2015 will be remembered for marriage equality. Public figures have been more open discussing their own sexuality. And popular TV shows have begun to incorporate more LGBTQ characters, and the stories they tell. But if you look at these two maps, side by side, it's clear the LGBTQ civil rights battles are far from over. "

140,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,YxEa_SpL_Fs,"&lt;&lt;Phone ringing&gt;&gt; ""Hello?"" I'm, uh, planning a wedding for next spring.""  ""a quick quote for a venue for a family gathering"" ""between 120 and 130 guests."" ""for 125 people"" ""we're aiming for April 16th""  ""the 16th"" ""That's going to be a $15,000 food and beverage minimum"" ""The food and beverage minimum is $17,000."" This 2000 dollar difference is what's known as the ""wedding mark-up"" where some venders charge a higher price for weddings than for other similar parties so why are weddings so expensive? The wedding website ""The Knot""surveyed thousands of its members and found that the average cost of their weddings was thirty-one thousand dollars last year that's not including honeymoon wedding dresses average at thirteen hundred dollars and catering comes in its $68 dollars per person. And those numbers are a lot higher if you live in places like New York Chicago DC or San Francisco the wedding industry is kinda weird and it's an industry that I have quite a bit of experience in my way Isabel and I run a wedding videography business in Washington DC and here's my take on my way to so expensive There's this economic concept called asymmetric information. With most things you buy you have a pretty good gauge in what you're getting for what you pay for. you pretty sure that an 8 dollar avocado is way too much because you've bought avocados before. Familiarity with a market produces balanced information between buyers and sellers and so they can settle on a fair price This is like economics 101. but most people shopping for wedding stuff and very little if any experience with what they're buying. cake, dress, napkins, catering, venues, flowers. This is something you just don't buy very often so you have a very good gauge on what should be paying. This is made a lot harder by the fact that we wedding vendors have a hard time posting our prices. You usually have to reach out and inquire to get any sort of pricing information. Imagine if you had asked for pricing for every item in the grocery store. Shopping would be a lot harder. When I first was starting my business I read on a blogs about marketing to prospective clients. And overwhelming message that I kept reading is ""steer away from talking about price"" Blogger: ""we've put together a free report that shows you how to answer ""price question"" with those email  leads in a way that steers them away from price quickly so you can get them on the phone or to a meeting where you can book them!"" And then there's Pinterest. Planning: ""Pinterest can be really useful I think using it as a starting point"" It's an amazing tool for wedding inspiration or if you have an experience wedding planner by your side, but usually doesn't help with the price question. ""...and you see all these like amazing dresses and you can click on it to like get more information. you're going to get a lot more pictures , but you're not gonna find any pricing information. And of course there's always the option to ""repin"" it if you'd liked. If you  are like a normal person with a budget like you're setting yourself up to be let down. Another thing that makes wedding so expensive is the once in a lifetime mentality. The classic line for brides shopping for a wedding dress is: Designer:  ""It's the dress of your life , and if there's ever one picture will have of you, it's the one in your wedding dress wedding dress."" That's wedding dress designer and artist talking on Planet Money. I'm as guilty as anyone at this: Here's were very first ads. it's all about that once in a lifetime feel. It's just really hard not to splurge when you put so much weight into one day. So, it's easy to look at this and think there's no doubt that wedding vendors are ripping off their clients. But there's another side to the story that i think is important to mention. Planner: ""Corporate flowers for example all there's probably going to be direction but maybe there's a little bit more flexibility where as a bride had dreamt up a certain flowers and she in want to talk to the florist multiple times about the bouquet and the ribbon treatment and the fact that her grandmother's broaches gonna be on that Bouquet. It's a lot of time and energy spent on those flowers and that's gonna be reflected in the price."" The upshot of this is that the emotional weight of weddings usually means more work for vendors, and thus higher prices. And the most demanding clients are the ones that set the prices for everyone. So the best thing you can do to avoid being swindled is to demand the price range before hearing a sales pitch. we vendors might hate it but it's the fair thing to do. "
141,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,ZORzsubQA_M,"If you imagine a typical American city street, and you take away the space that’s dedicated to cars, you aren’t left with very much. There are some narrow walkways on the side, and some bridges in between them, but not much else. Cars dominate cities. Spend some time walking around most cities and you’ll find yourself pushed to narrow sidewalks, waiting for crosswalk lights. You’ll find cyclists navigating really narrow strips of space. Americans are used to cars the way that fish are used to water. That’s so ubiquitous in the U.S. that I think for most people, it just never occurred to them that it could be otherwise. But what if there were a way to change that? To give space back to pedestrians and bicyclists, and to make cities more friendly to life outside of a car? It turns out Barcelona might have a solution. In 2014, the city was faced with serious air pollution problems. Barcelona and its 35 surrounding municipalities consistently failed to meet the EU’s air quality targets. Studies were showing that air pollution in the region causes 3,500 premature deaths every year. Traffic in the city also causes severe noise pollution. So the city developed an extensive Urban Mobility Plan with the hope of reducing traffic by 21 percent. The coolest part of the plan were these things: They call them ""superilles"". Superilles? “Si, superilles.” That translates to “superblocks”. It’s this urban design concept intended to minimize the presence of cars in city centers. The word “superblock” has been used before to describe huge city blocks without any passageways for cars. But that’s not what’s happening here. So here’s how Barcelona’s plan works. You take nine square city blocks and close off the inside to through traffic. So buses, big freight trucks — or any vehicles that are trying to get from one part of town to the next — have to drive around the perimeter. Inside the superblock, the speed limit is kept to 10 kilometers per hour — that translates to just over 6 miles per hour — and curbside parking is replaced by underground parking. That means you wind up with street space for markets, outdoor games, and events. Within this nine square block perimeter you're gonna have kind of a pleasant streetscape where people can walk around and mingle and do things without this kind of constant fear of cars around. The concept is going to be tested out in five neighborhoods, but the city has identified 120 possible intersections throughout the region where it could be implemented. So how do we know what the results of this kind of plan would look like? Well, northwest of Barcelona is a city called Vitoria-Gasteiz, which has implemented superblock designs since 2008. In the main superblock at the city center, pedestrian space increased from 45 percent of the total surface area to 74 percent. With so much less traffic, noise levels dropped from 66.5 dBA to 61 dBA. Most impressive of all, there was a 42% reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions and a 38% reduction in particle pollution in the area. On top of that, business is up. What you consistently see when people change their streetscapes to prioritize human beings over cars is you don't see any decline in economic activity, you see the opposite. You get more people walking and cycling around more slowly, stopping more often patronizing businesses more, and that … center of social activity will tend to build on itself. So here’s the question: could something like this work in an American city? Barcelona has some unique advantages getting started on this plan, in that a lot of it was built before cars, and a lot of it was built on a simple grid. The district of Eixample — where the superblock plan is based — was designed in 1859 in this repetitive grid structure by this guy, Ildefons Cerdá. He basically invented the word for (and the study of) “urbanization” when he laid out this grid plan for Barcelona that evenly distributed resources like schools and hospitals. But superblock designers insist that cities don’t need a simple grid structure to implement this kind of plan. It can work anywhere. Now, cities in the US have have attempted some car-minimizing projects like this. The problem is, they’re usually done in wealthier areas with lots of existing businesses. Zoning policies often require separation of residential and commercial areas — but an ideal walkable area would be a mix of the two. On top of that, zoning minimums on parking availability encourage the presence of cars and parking lots, and minimums on street width make for wide, unwalkable streets. Because of that, walkable districts are basically isolated luxury items in the US. What makes the Barcelona plan different is that they aren’t setting aside one fancy neighborhood or town square to make pedestrian-friendly — instead, by proposing superblocks throughout the entire city, they’ve declared car-free spaces a right for everybody, no matter what part of town they're in. Maybe —&nbsp;this might be overly optimistic —&nbsp;but I think it has sunk in in the U. S. that the model whereby every city resident comes with a car — and drives a car everywhere – is just inherently limited. It limits the growth of your city, it limits the health of your city and the growth of your city. So one way or another we have to find ways of having a lot of people live close to one another without all of them having cars. You know, being able to get around and work and play in live and have enjoyable lives without cars. "
142,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,ZRDIHcFRPFs,"So here’s a controversial opinion: Pigeons are underrated. Does each one of them create an estimated 25 pounds of shit each year? Yes. Can that shit spread disease? Yes. But the same applies to a couple of animals that we often share our beds with. And pigeons, though they may seem useless, have actually played an outsized role in world history and in the history of science. If you read the first chapter of Darwin’s book On The Origin of Species - it isn’t about the animals he famously observed in the tropics. Instead, he opened his book by talking about pigeons. Darwin noticed how pigeon fanciers had created a huge variety of pigeon breeds from a single species -- columbia livia, the rock pigeon. And he used this example of artificial selection to help communicate his own game-changing theory of natural selection. By that time, rock pigeons had been domesticated by humans for thousands of years, for food and as pets. It was actually once a status symbol to build giant bird houses for pigeons -- they’re called dovecotes and they’re still standing today in many parts of Europe and Asia. That’s ultimately why there are pigeons in American cities: Europeans were fond of them, and they brought them here. And until recently, pigeons were seen as useful companions. For instance, they were deployed in war for thousands of years, including the World Wars. “Sleek and well-fed pigeons, busy raising families of more flying messengers for use by troops in the field” They delivered a lot of messages. That’s Phil Edwards - he writes about history here at Vox. It didn’t need power. It didn’t need electrical lines. All it needed was the ability to fly and it would carry the message with it, and reliably it would get home. One pigeon saved 200 stranded American soldiers by delivering a message during World War 1, despite being badly injured. In the second world war, the UK expanded their pigeon corps to 250,000 birds and sent parachutes carrying pigeons into occupied Europe- like a prepaid envelope- to solicit information. 32 pigeons ended up winning a medal for valor, the Dickin medal. Scientists haven’t quite figured out the mechanism behind their homing abilities, but some pigeons can be driven hundreds of miles away and still fly right home. It’s a skill that hasn’t gone unnoticed by criminal elements. “Brazilian prison authorities have discovered a new smuggling scheme used in jails. Carrier pigeons are used to deliver drugs and mobile phones to inmates” And it’s the secret to those ceremonial white “doves” - they’re pigeons. And they just go home when they’re released. During World War 2 pigeons were also part of a long-shot project headed by famous behaviorist B.F. Skinner. And the idea was that pigeons could be used to guide a missile toward its target. Skinner found that he could train pigeons to peck at a target with high accuracy by rewarding their behavior. And they were able to hit a single street corner on a map with enough training. But ultimately the army decided not to use it because there were better advances in guided missiles and probably because it was pigeons. Skinner kept working with pigeons for the rest of his career though. They helped him show how reinforcement could shape even complex behaviors. “I will try to pick out some particular pattern of behavior and make it a more frequent part of the repertoire of the bird.” Building on these ideas, a project headed by the Coast Guard later on tried to use the pecking behavior to search for people lost at sea. They lived in a little bubble at the bottom of a helicopter when they were on these missions. What they did was they pecked when they saw objects floating in the water. And they did really well. “The contest was on. Who would spot the target first: The human observers or the pigeons? They had an accuracy rate that was significantly higher than humans because they never fell asleep, they had better eyesight and they were simply more interested in the task of trying to find things because they believed that it would give them a reward. The program never moved beyond testing because of equipment failures and budget cuts. But also, our relationship with pigeons shifted. They became widely seen as pests. In fact they’re one of the the birds not protected by federal law, and there’s an entire industry dedicated to their removal. ""The sun shining bright. Everything seems alright when we're poisoning pigeons in the park."" Maybe because we have drones and email and GPS, all we want from our animals is for them to be cute. But these little bastards could guide our f***ing missiles. I mean come on, they deserve a little respect. We'll murder them amid laughter and merriment, except for the few we take home to experiment."" "
143,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,Zm6na9tz4-s,"This is the Coexist logo you might know: star and crescent, peace sign, the well-known gender...e, star of David, Wiccan i, yin yang, and Christian cross. It's the bumper sticker gibberish you see on that 1998 Volvo that just cut you off. But the real story doesn't start in a co-op in Montpelier, Vermont. The story of Coexist begins in Poland —&nbsp;and it's had its own battles. ""My name is Piotr Mlodozeniec. I am a graphic designer. I am making posters, book covers, record covers, some layouts. I paint also."" This is his son's room and here's a poster designed by Piotr's dad. In 2000, a contemporary art museum in Jerusalem held a competition. The theme was coexistence. And Mlodozeniec decided to enter. ""I started to write this coexistence in many ways. You know, handwritten, printed, and so on and so on."" The C reminded him a typical Muslim sign of the crescent. T as the Christian cross. And with the X, suddenly he imagined that he could do a Jewish star, so he took it and wrote Coexistence. ""But then I thought that I don't need this 'ence' at the end."" The poster became part of a worldwide touring exhibition, blown up to massive proportions, and that's when other people saw an opportunity to take it as their own. ""I do the work, and I throw it into the open world."" Mlodozeniec had let his design travel around the world, but then he forgot about it. In 2005, he got the first news that something was happening. Some Indiana University students trademarked an extremely similar design without Mlodozeniec's or the museum's permission. They started to sue anybody else selling Coexist gear. Average t-shirt price: $58. They registered it as their own logo. One used it to get his ""lifestyle design"" degree from the university. Another co-founder told Newsday that Mlodozeniec was ""OK with its use."" ""I was really mad at this, because nobody asked me for permission."" Soon, Bono had made the logo a central part of U2's 2005 Vertigo tour. ""Some graffiti sprayed up on a wall not too far from here. This is Co-Ex-Ist."" The Indiana guys told reporters they got a call that Bono was wearing a headband with ""your"" logo. ""Jesus, jew, Muhammed, it's true. Jesus, jew..."" ""And when I heard that leader of U2, Mr. Bono, is using this sign, I even was pleased."" But they didn't ask him for permission, and after the contact with him, they gave him a tiny credit on the DVD label. Soon, another Coexist logo showed up with completely nonsensical additions. ""The better is the enemy of the good. Whoa, I will put the Tao sign in it, I will put the hippie sign in it, I will put Osiris sign. Oh it will be great! It will be all the religions! Whenever you have something good and you want to make it better—it will spoil and it will be worse than the original."" Mlodozeniec had been lumped in with lawsuit-happy luxury shirt sellers and a bad design from California, and it wasn't what his work was really even about. Mlodozeniec comes from a school of Polish poster-making that emphasizes color and organic looking pictures. It's really vibrant. It's not the ascetic, black and white appearance of the Coexist sign — it's something more alive and more representative of the work that he's a fan of. But even though Coexist is different from most of his work, it has a lot of meaning. Coexist isn't just a bumper sticker everywhere. To a graphic designer living in Poland, post 9/11, with refugees coming in from an unstable Syria, it means a lot more. ""In 2000, the situation was not so...complicated like today. This logo was not so, maybe...actual. I didn't know that the world will go in this direction. That, you know, this coexist is, you know, a must. You have to do it."" So maybe you couldn't quite see that poster in the background. Fortunately, early on we had some camera adjustment time where it was clear. This is Horse and Plume, and it's a CYRK poster —&nbsp;CYRK — which means ""circus."" Because this poster and many posters like it were made to promote the Polish circus and they quickly became representative of an entire school of really expressive Polish poster design. "
144,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,_5jnn1AIt7Q,"In most of the world, this is a strange sight. It’s a TV commercial for a prescription drug. These ads are illegal in most countries. but in the US, they’re everywhere. On average, 80 of them air every hour on American television. ""Ask your doctor."" ""...my doctor told me..."" ""Ask your doctor."" The American Medical Association, a major group of doctors, has called for a ban on these direct-to-consumer ads. But there’s a case to be made for them too. So today we’ll take a look at both sides. First, a little background. Before the 1980s, prescription drug commercials were unheard of in the US. Drug companies focused their marketing solely on doctors, and they didn’t want to hurt those relationships. When asked by Congress in 1984, if direct-to-consumer advertising should be allowed, one pharmaceutical executive said: And an executive at Schering-Plough, which is now part of Merck, said: Needless to say, they changed their minds. At the time there was a larger cultural shift in health care toward empowering patients to make decisions rather than just listening to their doctors. And advertisements fit with that trend. Drug Ads started appearing in print publications, but there was still another thing keeping them off TV, and that was FDA’s regulations at the time. They were interpreted as requiring ads to include all of the information about the drug’s risks and side effects, which simply wasn’t feasible to do in a tv or radio commercial the way it was in a magazine. There was a bizarre loophole though: The ads didn’t have to mention the drug’s risks, if they also didn’t mention the disease or condition that the drug was supposed to treat. Here’s what that looked like — in an ad for Claritin back before it was available over the counter: ""It’s time."" ""It’s time!"" ""Don’t wait another minute with Claritin."" ""Claritin."" ""I’ll ask my doctor!"" ""It’s time to see your doctor."" ""Mr. Wilkin, the doctor will see you now."" ""At last, a clear day is here."" Confused? Yeah, everyone was. So in 1997, the FDA clarified that the industry could run the full drug ads and wouldn’t have to give ALL the risk information from the label, as long as they included the major side effects and referred viewers to another source for the rest. That’s why the commercials direct us to phone numbers or print ads. Come for the pharmaceutical fine print — stay for “the secret to crisp contact in soggy conditions” That new FDA guidance removed the main barrier keeping drugs off of television. and you can guess what happened next... spending on ads quadrupled by 2004. And now, we know the names of prescription drugs like we know the names of cars and clothing brands. ""Lunesta, Xanax, Celebrex, Flomax, and HGH."" ""And as of Thursday, Lipitor."" ""Oh and if you have trouble sleeping, Marla has Ambien. I prefer Lunesta."" ""Lipitor, Baby Aspirin... Flomax."" ""Flomax?"" ""…and some Cialis! I’m just assuming."" So that’s how we got here. Drug ads are now the most frequent form of health communication that most Americans see. So what does that mean for public health? Are those prescriptions going to the right people? Or are they going to people who probably won’t benefit from the drug — people for whom the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits? Well, the answer seems to be: both. A clever experiment in 2005 tested this by sending actors to real primary care doctors. Dr. Richard Kravitz: We helped them make appointments. In half of the visits, the actors reported symptoms of depression. In the other half of the visits, the actors said they were feeling down after becoming unemployed. The study authors called this an “adjustment disorder.” In some visits, the actors mentioned seeing an advertisement for Paxil on TV, that's an antidepressant. In others, they didn’t bring up medication at all. And the doctors seemed to take patients more seriously if they mentioned seeing the Paxil commercial. They were more likely to refer patients to a mental health consultation, And much more likely to prescribe an antidepressant. That may be a good thing for those with major depression, who might benefit from an medication. But it’s more questionable for those with a more temporary condition. This study, and others, have shown that doctors can be persuaded to broaden the scope of who gets treated with drugs. And advertisements often seem designed to encourage that. Take Androgel — it was approved to treat men with hypogonadism: that’s extremely low testosterone levels due to injury or disease. But here’s how it was promoted by Abbott: ""Millions of men 45 and older just don’t feel like they used to. Are you one of them? Remember when you had more energy for 18 holes with your buddies? More passion for the one you love."" Some middle aged men don’t feel like they used to? You don’t say. A study looking back at 10 years of testosterone prescriptions found that only half had been diagnosed with hypogonadism in the previous year. Drug ads give the industry an incentive to make healthy people feel unhealthy. “Latisse is the only FDA approved prescription treatment for inadequate, or not enough lashes.” And they contribute to unrealistic expectations about what pharmaceuticals can do. So what’s wrong with that? Well, every single drug comes with risks. Big ad campaigns are usually for newer drugs, for which not all the risks may be known yet. In the case of the painkiller Vioxx, a massive ad campaign led millions of people with arthritis to switch to Vioxx instead of sticking with older drugs like Ibuprofen. “It’s a beautiful morning…ask your doctor today about Vioxx, and find out what Vioxx can do for you."" Vioxx was more expensive and not actually more effective, and... “The manufacturer of Vioxx have just recently pulled this popular arthritis drug from the market over health concerns."" Merck withdrew the drug after it became clear that it increased the risk of heart attacks and stroke. A Kaiser Permanente study later confirmed that ad exposure was linked to inappropriate prescribing of Vioxx and a similar drug called Celebrex. So that’s a worst case scenario. But there is also an argument that these ads can be good for public health. Sidney Taurel: “There are many diseases for which people don’t seek treatment. So if you can educate through direct-to-consumer about the fact that this can be treated, you will get a better outcome for everyone.” In their view, more communication with your doctor is always a good thing. And it’s up to the doctor to make the right prescribing decisions. Surveys of the public have confirmed that drug ads prompt people to visit their doctor, in some cases for diabetes, hypertension, depression — these are conditions that are thought to be under treated. In the case of the HPV vaccine, that's now recommended for all pre-teens to prevent cervical and other cancers, Merck’s ad blitz for Gardasil probably reached more people than a government communications effort could. And whatever you think of erectile dysfunction drugs, they got men to see their doctors and undergo the required heart screening, potentially catching problems not yet treated. But the strongest argument in favor of drug ads may be the legal one. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of prescription drug advertising back in the 1970s, when the state of Virginia tried to prohibit pharmacists from advertising their prices. Harry Blackmun: “We further hold that so called commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the 1st and 14th amendments. The individual consumer and society in general may have strong interests in the free flow of commercial information.” It was the first time that the Court said advertisements were entitled to free speech protections. There was only one dissenting Justice at the time: William Rehnquist — who Ronald Reagan would later appoint Chief Justice — In his dissent, Rehnquist wrote a kind of uncanny prediction of the type of commercials that would come decades later: ""Don't spend another sleepless night. Ask your doctor to prescribe Seconal without delay."" Rehnquist worried that ads would “generate patient pressure on physicians to prescribe” drugs; and that they’d end up being “advertised on television.” And as we know now, for better or for worse, that’s exactly what happened.

145,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,_Ch5ClOB9AE,"These are peanut m&amp;ms. This is you eating a lot of peanut m&amp;ms after seeing stories about chocolate’s unbelievable health benefits. Carlos also just loves peanut m&amp;ms. Almost every week you can open the newspaper, or turn on your favorite news website — not Vox, but other news web sites — and notice that there are stories about the purported health benefits of chocolate. Chocolate can help you live longer, it’ll make your nails shinier, it’ll help you lose weight. There are so many stories about chocolate and its health benefits and we just love to gobble them up. But chocolate hasn’t always been a media darling. In the past, it was thought to cause acne. No, this is just regular adult acne… I don’t drink enough water. And this article from 1997 even called it “addictive.” At Vox, we started to ask ourselves how did chocolate become a health food? It turns out, there’s a reason behind the chocolate madness. In 1982, Mars, which is one of the world’s biggest chocolate makers, established something called the Mars Center for Cocoa Health Sciences. And its aim was to learn more about the cocoa bean and understanding cocoa and chocolate’s effects on the body, and whether it might have any health benefits. Vox examined the Mars sponsored research and found that out of a hundred studies we identified over the last 40 years, 98 of them had positive or favorable conclusions. That’s a pretty big number, and it made us wonder - what’s so magical about chocolate that it’s getting these glowing reviews? Flae-vah-nols, Flah-vah-nols, Flae-vah-nols, Flah-vah-nols, they’re micronutrients that are found in the cocoa bean and they’re thought to have antioxidant properties. Mars’ initial focus was on the overall benefits of chocolate, but it shifted to this specific compound. Some of these studies concluded that flavanols could boost your mood and cognitive performance, and that both cocoa powder and dark chocolate can have a “favorable effect” on cardiovascular disease risk. Which sounds awesome, but it doesn’t mean all kinds of chocolate have the same health benefits —&nbsp;or any health benefits at all. Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and cocoa beans aren’t the same thing. To understand why, we have to check out a cocoa tree near the equator. Just kidding, this isn’t Borders, folks. Cocoa or cacao beans come from these trees. The beans are roasted and ground into what we know as cocoa powder or cocoa butter. Dark chocolate is made mostly from cocoa butter and typically has a higher percentage of cocoa. Milk chocolate is created from cocoa and, well, milk. The difference is that it goes through more processing with added ingredients. It has more fats and sugar and less cocoa — that’s what makes milk chocolate so sweet. But it’s also the reason milk chocolate isn’t your best bet for these flavanols. One of the big problems with flavanols, is that when you process chocolate you end up killing them off. In addition, different types of cocoa beans have varying amounts of flavanols to begin with. So, different kinds of chocolate contain varying amounts of the compound manufacturers have been basing their studies on. So, the reason companies are funding so much science, they’re putting money into their own science and research institutions, and they’re funding chairs at universities… And the reason they’re doing that is to sell more chocolate. Chocolate is big business. Chocolate sales have gone up from $14.2 billion in 2007 to $18.9 billion in 2017. And Mars isn’t the only company profiting from this. Some of the world’s biggest chocolate makers are also funding cocoa science, hyping it up to be the next big thing to help you lose weight, or remember where you left your keys. When the media, and press offices interpret some of these studies, we like to write “chocolate” in our stories even though the studies were only looking at cocoa beans or cocoa supplements. Despite a growing obesity epidemic, this niche of nutrition science is steering health-conscious consumers toward premium and gourmet dark chocolate. These products are now seen as “healthy indulgences.” In short term studies, researchers have found that flavanols can lower blood pressure or improve cognition by certain measures. But none of these things have actually been studied in long term research on endpoints that really matter for health. Well then, do these studies even matter? So I want to be clear, these studies aren’t necessarily bad studies, many of them have passed peer-review and been published in prestigious journals. But when you design and interpret a study there are all kinds of ways that bias can be introduced. This study published in Nature Neuroscience is a good example of that. In 2014, this Mars-sponsored study looked at whether cocoa flavanols could prevent cognitive decline. The problems with this study? It ran for only 12 weeks, involved a small number of participants, and focused on narrow outcomes that made the results unreliable. Okay… maybe there's more hype around the benefits of chocolate than there should be. But like what’s the worse that can happen if you eat a bunch of chocolate? A little bit of anything isn’t really bad for health. But chocolate is also filled with a lot of sugar, calories and fat. And consuming a lot of those things would counteract any health benefits you might get from the flavanols or the antioxidants in even the best cocoa. Right, so you probably want to eat chocolate in moderation, and not be this guy eating a bunch of it in one sitting … dude… Are you still filming me? to say, lower your blood pressure because there’s no excuse, er, science to back that behavior.

146,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,_fzNdnzL8Ms,"With the United Kingdom leaving the European Union, it's natural to wonder what this means for the EU going forward. And there's really two different ways to think about it. One, if you want to be optimistic about the European project, is that the EU could actually be stronger without the UK in it. To understand how, it helps to look at the history of the EU And the idea is to take this continent that is the cradle of a wonderful civilization, but has also been the scene of some incredibly destructive wars, some horrific political crimes, and make sure that kind of thing can never happen again. And the idea was if they unified the steel and coal industries across national boundaries, they wouldn't be able to fight wars with one another. But the UK was never completely on board. They weren't one of the six original countries to join up they joined a little bit reluctantly, they didn't want to join the single currency project. And English people have, in a geographic sense, often not felt that they are even quote unquote part of Europe. So, to an extent they've always been the marginal member, and if anyone is going to leave, it would be them. Once the UK is out, the remaining countries might be able to get some important things done, like crafting a common immigration and foreign policy, which the EU doesn’t have, and trying to figure out a way to make the common currency work better. They don’t have a common tax policy, they don’t have a common welfare state It may be easier for the countries that remain to build stronger institutions, And you may ultimately see a stronger, even though it’s a smaller Europe. That’s the optimistic view Now, another view could be that we're looking at the beginning of the unraveling of the whole thing. You start pulling a thread on the sweater, and it's all going to collapse. You see polls from France and even Germany, the countries at the very heart of Europe, showing that it's become unpopular. They don’t feel ownership over European politics. It's a bunch of guys, sitting around in a Belgian city, negotiating deals in a language they don't speak. They don’t have a spirit of European patriotism and a deep, emotional European identity. The EU has a lot of the attributes of a nation state. It has a flag, they have a national anthem, but it doesn't have any words. If you fielded a single EU soccer team, it would win the World Cup every time, but no one would cheer for it. So, a lot of how this turns in the end has to do with what kind of deal the UK can reach with the EU. If the UK manages to get out but to then still have a really favorable free trade deal with the EU and really sort of prosper, that's going to make it easier for other countries to say well, they want out too every time a decision happens that they don't like. So there's a strong incentive  to make this messy, to make it really as painful as possible. If EU leaders manage to exact a high price from the UK in leaving, that means that probably the rest of the union is not going to break up. "
147,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,aKyvGHycngM,"Search Google Earth for China and you’ll see this. But an unedited satellite photo might look more like this. That gray smudge is air pollution and it’s coming from Chinese cars, factories, and power plants. But it’s not only here. In cities around the world, air pollution is a big problem. A majority of humans now live in cities and that number is only going to rise, which means more cars, more factories, and more power plants. As officials explore options for fighting air pollution, there is one tool that is often overlooked: trees. Cities are centers of industry, but the resulting pollution is filling our lungs and making us sick. One major culprit is particulate matter: airborne particles of dust, soot and smoke that are released when we burn fossil fuels or kicked up during construction and farming. When we inhale them, they can cause asthma and they can also enter our bloodstream to cause strokes and even death. Experts estimate that outdoor air pollution kills over three million people a year and as cities grow, leaders are funding creative—and often expensive—solutions for the problem. In London, the mayor spent over a million pounds spraying city streets with an adhesive that was supposed to glue pollutants to the road. and in the Netherlands, designers have created a giant air purifier they call ""The Smog Free Tower"", which is cool, but there is another, simpler solution… A new report from The Nature Conservancy shows that planting trees can be a cost-effective way to improve public health, which they do in two ways: First, a tree removes particulate matter when polluted air blows through its branches. The particulate matter settles on the leaves and when it rains the dust is washed down the gutter so we don’t inhale it. Second, trees cool temperatures by providing shade and releasing water through photosynthesis, which cools summer temperatures by about two to four degrees fahrenheit. But there is a catch! Trees can only clean and cool the air within a close radius: about one hundred feet, so city officials need to be careful where they plant. Officials can maximize pollution reduction by planting trees where population density and air pollution overlap. The Nature Conservancy report uses data from Washington D.C. to create a map showing where planting trees will have the highest return on investment. And some trees work better than others: trees with larger, stickier leaves, like maples and elms are more effective, but they also need to be considered within the larger ecosystem. Compared to DC, many cities around the world have even more to gain from planting trees: this map shows where return on investment is highest for reducing particulate matter. With proper targeting, planting trees can be just as cost-effective as other strategies like converting public transportation to use less diesel fuel. But there is one major limiting factor: water access. What might work in Boston, will be less feasible in a city like Doha, Qatar, where water is a scarce resource. And on top of that, many mayors don’t yet think of trees as a public health resource. Trees might not look like giant air filters, but that’s exactly what they are, and the sooner we start thinking of them that way, the sooner the air we breathe might be cooler and cleaner in cities around the world.

148,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,aQO_oexCm5s,"150,000 people are going to die today. And one of the brutally unfair realities of life is that where you are born can dramatically change how and at what age you die. There's a really fascinating measurement called ""years of life lost"" which measures how many years shy of the realistic life expectancy people die. So if a person can hope to live to age 86 but they die in a car accident at age 21, those 65 years are considered ""lost years of life"" due to car accidents. It's basically a way to measure why people are dying early. Hundreds of researchers from around the world collaborated to collect and analyze that data for each country, and the result is this map. It shows the leading cause of early death in each country for 2013. Look at Africa. People die early here mainly because of infectious diseases like Pneumonia, Malaria, and Diarrhea which are easily treated in places with stronger health infrastructures. And people are dying young in these places: 4 out of every 10 deaths in these poor countries are among people under 15. Meanwhile in Saudia Arabia... Even though half of the population is forbidden to drive, traffic accidents are the number one cause of lost years of life. There's a big trend among young guys to see how crazy they can get on the road. Between that and the lax speed limit enforcement, 19 people die every day on Saudi roads. It's the same problem facing young guys in neighboring countries. Over in Venezuela, 25,000 people were killed in homicides last year making violence the leading cause of years lost. Only around 8% of crimes are prosecuted, so gang violence usually goes unchecked. It's a similar situation in neighboring Colombia. Syria, where a bloody conflict rages on, war was the leading cause of lost life. In China, a lot of people are dying from stroke. This is actually an indicator of a major transition in the region. As the economy in China has industrialized and surged over the past 3 decades, infectious diseases like the ones we saw in Africa, dropped dramatically due to better health infrastructure. But a stronger economy means eating more fat and sugar, moving less, and breathing in a lot more air pollution. Plus they are living longer. All of these factors increase the likelihood of stroke. Then there's the wealthier countries, where heart disease is the number one cause of early death. Strangely, it's actually the sign of the privilege of old age since heart disease is generally considered an age-related disease. See, in poor countries, the biggest threat is diseases that kill people early on in life. But in rich countries, death typically comes after a much longer life, even if it is earlier than the life expectancy. So the good news is that, overall, ""years of life lost"" are decreasing in almost every category worldwide. People are living longer overall. So even though all of this talk about death seems kind of depressing, it's actually really good news. "
149,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,bBn8SKZoWyQ,"These are two drinks from the same store. They’re the same in almost every way. But this one costs $3 extra. All it took was a few drops of this stuff — CBD. It's a cannabis compound you can buy in oils, chocolates, bath bombs, face masks, gummies, coffee, lotions, even dog treats. It’s everywhere. And its proponents claim that it can help with a lot of things: CBD exists right at the intersection of three huge consumer trends: The 49 billion-dollar herbal supplement industry, the growing anxiety economy, and the almost overnight rise of a legal cannabis marketplace. There’s still a lot we don’t know about CBD. But people are buying it. This is how much consumer CBD sales have grown in the past four years. And this is how much they’re expected to grow. For a product this popular, CBD is barely regulated and people tend to misunderstand its effects. So what do we know about it? CBD — or cannabidiol — is one of over 110 chemical constituents in cannabis called cannabinoids. THC — or tetrahydrocannabinol — is a different cannabis chemical that causes the high associated with consuming marijuana. But by itself, CBD won’t get you high. You can inhale it as a vapor, or apply it to your skin, but a popular intake method is edible oil — since CBD is naturally soluble in fat. That easy-to-consume format is behind the explosion of many new products we’re seeing today. But it’s also led to a lot of misconceptions. For starters, people say CBD can treat everything from inflammation, to acne — even cancer. But there’s no proof that consumer CBD products can treat all those ailments. We don't have that much data related to the therapeutic effects of cannabidiol. CBD has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that have been shown to help treat psychosis, anxiety, movement disorders, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy and seizures. And the FDA recently approved Epidiolex, a CBD-based epilepsy drug. But there isn’t enough research for CBD to be prescribed as medicine for all of those other conditions. Right now, we don’t know a ton about how CBD affects the brain, or which doses or delivery methods work most effectively. And people who take CBD sometimes do it at risk to their own health, foregoing medically approved treatments or failing to investigate its interactions with other drugs. And the CBD that has trickled down to retail markets? It’s largely unregulated. Because of that, consumers often have no idea what they’re buying — and CBD products often don’t contain what they say they do. A) They might not even have the cannabidiol that is claimed on the label — but more importantly, B) is that some of them actually have THC in it. In 2016, the FDA issued warnings to 8 CBD oil companies after finding that some contained either no or barely any CBD, and some contained illegal amounts of psychoactive THC. And a 2017 study of 84 CBD products purchased online found that almost 70 percent were mislabeled. But even when consumer CBD products are accurately labeled, the doses tend to be very low. When you get a few drops of CBD oil in a drink, you’re probably getting about 5-10 milligrams of CBD. You’d need 30 times that to reach the amount of CBD that current research has found to have stress-relieving results. So even though CBD has a ton of medical promise, the dose in the average CBD coffee is pretty negligible. But even at those levels, CBD products other than Epidiolex are still technically illegal. When you go down the street and you buy your latte with cannabidiol, that is still considered ""federally illegal. At the state level it might not be, depending on which state you're in, but federally speaking, it is still illegal. The DEA maintains that CBD is federally illegal — but it won’t bother going after anyone possessing or using it. And because the DEA won’t prosecute, anybody from any state can walk into a store or go online and buy CBD products. Attitudes in health care are shifting: in December 2017, the World Health Organization concluded that CBD is not harmful. In January 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency removed it from its prohibited substances list. And, if passed as it stands, the 2018 farm bill would legalize CBD and industrial hemp nationwide. CBD isn’t bullsh*t. It’s a substance with a lot of potential. But the quantity and quality in today’s consumer products is often more of a scam than a reliable wellness supplement. What’s next for CBD depends on research. But right now, its popularity is proof that the absence of data doesn’t prevent people from selling products. Instead, when you can claim everything — you can sell anything. "
150,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,bX4qUsgHa4Y,"“We need rescue inside the auditorium. Multiple victims.” The United States has a problem with gun violence. BUSH: We hold the victims in our hearts. CLINTON: Perhaps we may never fully understand it. “A man with a semiautomatic weapon.” We talk about it after mass shootings. But it’s much larger, and more complicated than those debates allow. Here’s what you need to know about the state of gun violence in America. It’s true that the US sees many more mass shootings than these other developed countries. Between 2000 and 2014, there were 133 mass shootings in public, populated places. That’s excluding gang violence and terrorism. Of course, the US is a much larger country, but if you adjust for population size, it still ranks higher. Of these countries, Finland is next, with just 2 shootings over 14 years, but a much, much smaller population. And this type of tragedy seems to be happening more often in the US. Each of these squares represents a public mass shooting with 4 or more fatalities. Before 2011, they happened 6 months apart on average, but since then, only 2 months go by between them. OBAMA: I hope and pray that I don't have to come out again during my tenure as president to offer my condolences to families in these circumstances. That was October 1, 2015. And just about 2 months later. OBAMA: Yesterday, a tragedy occurred in San Bernardino. Our first order of business is to send our thoughts and prayers to the families of those who've been killed. Public mass shootings get all the attention because they’re often so indiscriminate, but the truth is mass shootings are unlike most gun deaths in America. Here’s how it breaks down: According to the most recent data, 92 people are killed with guns every day on average. About 30 of those are homicides of which maybe 1.5 at most can be considered part of mass shootings. Most of those killed, 58 people a day, are suicides. The rest are accidental shootings, police actions, and undetermined incidents. Those suicides - they show up in international comparisons, too. These are the 10 countries ranked highest on Human Development by the UN. The US has the highest suicide rate among them, and this darker bar shows how many of those are with guns. Some people think suicide isn’t really relevant to the gun issue. LOTT: To go and think some type of gun control regulations that are being talked about are going to stop somebody from committing suicide when there are so many other ways to commit suicide. But the methods that people use are important because suicide attempts often stem from temporary crises. The vast majority of people who survive suicide attempts don’t end up dying from suicide. But guns make it nearly impossible to get that second chance. The victims of gun suicides are overwhelmingly men, and mostly white. And the rate of gun suicides has been increasing in the US. At the same time, the rate of gun homicides has been decreasing, especially since the 90s when crime rates in general were higher. But if you compare the US to other developed countries, it doesn’t look like good news. These are homicides adjusted for population size. The US would probably have a higher homicide rate even without guns, but you can see how gun violence pushes that rate far beyond the other countries here. The victims of these shootings — they’re not the ones you often see on the national news. They’re disproportionately young black men. SHUNDRA ROBINSON: You guys can leave here and go on with your lives, but we gotta go home to empty rooms. Because our children’s lives were taken away by people who should not have had guns anyway. One possible explanation is that US simply has more crime than those other countries. But if you set aside homicides for a moment and look rates of burglary, or assault, you don’t see the same spike that you see with homicide. It’s not that America has much more crime. It’s that crime in the US is much more lethal. Altogether, the number of gun deaths in the US from 2000 to 2013 exceeds the number of Americans killed by AIDS, by illegal drug overdoses, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and terrorism, combined. It should be clear by now that this level of gun violence is a uniquely American problem among the developed world. And here’s one reason why. There are a ton of guns in the US. This chart of shows the estimated number of guns by country. It’s adjusted for population size and it’s still not even close. OREGON SHOOTER’S FATHER: The question that I would like to ask is how on Earth could he compile 13 guns? How can that happen? If you take a look back at the 10 countries with the highest levels of human development, you can see that it’s relatively really easy to get a gun in the US. All of the other countries require a license to purchase most guns and those purchases are recorded into an official registry. To get that license people have to state a reason for why they want a gun, and in most countries, they have to pass a safety test and are required by law to store their guns safely. In part because of its lax laws, there are well over 300 million guns in the US and counting. This chart doesn’t reflect private sales but it shows the number of background checks, which all federally licensed dealers have to run. It suggests the demand for guns has been increasing steeply since Barack Obama took office. So we’ve looked at gun deaths and at gun ownership. This chart puts them together. It shows that among highly developed countries, the more guns in a country, the more gun deaths. You can see that countries like Switzerland, which have relatively more guns than a country like the Netherlands, also have a higher gun death rate. And here’s the US. Likewise, US states with more guns have more gun homicides. There are outliers like Idaho, which has high rates of gun ownership but low rates of gun murders. But overall, there’s a correlation between gun ownership and homicide rates, and that relationship has held up in studies that control for things like poverty, unemployment, and crime. The correlation between gun ownership and gun deaths is even stronger for suicides. It make sense. Depression with a gun is more dangerous than depression without one. Likewise, fights, domestic disputes, road rage, drunkenness -- all much more dangerous with a gun than without. That said, you might need different policies to keep guns away from potential mass shooters than you’d need to keep them out of inner city gangs or out of the hands of someone who might hurt themselves. America doesn’t have a gun problem, it has several of them. "
151,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,ba63OVl1MHw,"This is the Joint Strike Fighter or F-35 Lightning II. It's planned to be America's new advanced fighter jet. The $100 million plane is stealth, can fly at supersonic speeds and one version can even take off and land vertically. It's one plane designed to replace the aging fleets of the Air Force, Navy, and Marines. It's the jet fighter of the future. But in December, Donald Trump put the entire project in doubt with a single tweet. saying it's too expensive. And Trump's not wrong the 16 year, $1 trillion project is seven years late and seventy percent over budget. But the F-35 is much more than a government purchase and canceling it is nearly impossible. That's because it's deeply woven into the US government, military, and economy. President Trump meet the Military-Industrial complex. So US defense companies make a lot of money. Their best client is the largest military in human history and they sell their products to other countries too, making the US the largest arms exporter in the world. As a result, they are some of the biggest companies in the world. This all requires a unique relationship with the US government. Not only defense companies bid on contracts from the Pentagon, but all of their domestic and foreign sales must also be approved by Congress. As a result, these companies try and get as much support in Congress as they can and they've adopted a pretty smart strategy to do so. One thing every member of Congress can support is jobs in their home state. So major US defense companies spread their operations across as many states as possible. By doing so they can maximize the number of legislators inclined to support their projects regardless of political party. I did a quick search and found just a small portion of Boeing and Raytheon locations across the US, along with legislators who voiced support for these companies in Congress. Now if you include subcontractors like the 3,000 hired by Boeing in California, you can imagine how many jobs are at stake across the country. This strategy is called political engineering and defense companies have gotten pretty good at it. In August 2015, Lockheed Martin purchased Sikorsky aircraft known for making the iconic Marine One helicopter used by American presidents. That brought the company into the lucrative defense helicopter market. It was a smart business move but a smarter political one. See, Sikorsky aircraft is based in Connecticut and the northeast is one area where Lockheed had little political influence. Rivals, General Dynamics United Technologies and Raytheon were the area's major defensive employers and therefore wielded the most important in Congress. But Sikorsky has 8,000 employees and Lockheed instantly became the third largest contractor in Connecticut and gain the political influence that comes with it . The Northeast is home to some of the defense industries most vocal supporters in Congress like Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut who wants Sikorsky to build the next Marine One in her own district. There's no doubt political engineering the smart strategy; Defense companies get more business and more jobs are created in America. But with so much political support and widespread economic impact some of these defense companies have been deemed ""too big to fail"" . Even when they appear to be failing. Now, back to that F-35 project Trump threatened to cancel. Despite deep design flaws and constant problems, there have been no serious efforts to cancel or scale back the project. In, fact through more than three years of cuts to defense spending funding for the f-35 entirely been touched. That's because the project was politically engineered to near-perfection. The Pentagon starting bidding for the F-35 in the mid-nineties It would be the largest defense contract in history, and Boeing and Lockheed Martin quickly emerged as the two contenders. Both had loyal supporters in Congress who were very eager to create jobs in their state. It was an intense competition and when Lockheed won the contract Boeing supporters quickly mobilized in Congress. Immediately they drafted legislation proposing to split the work between the two companies. When that failed they pushed award Boeing contracts for KC-767 tankers, C-17 cargo planes and radar-jamming Growler planes. Ensuring the Boeing factories in their states remained open. Today, the Lockheed Martin F-35 project supports a hundred and forty-six thousand jobs across 46 states. In fact, this interactive map is straight from the Lockheed Martin website. Parts for the plane are produced all over the country maximizing the number of stakeholders and ensuring broad bipartisan support in Congress. Lockheed Martin has also hired subcontractors in eight other countries to build components for the plane. And several allied countries have placed orders for their own militaries. Anything done to hurt the F-35 project could hurt those relationships. A procedure called concurrency also complicated things Concurrency is when a product goes into production before all the tests are complete. This is intended to speed up job creation because the sooner production starts the sooner jobs are created. So both defense companies and Congress are inclined to strike a deal quickly. But it's a flawed practice that's delayed the F-35 project by seven years. When testing reveals a problem, planes that have already been built need to be sent back and retrofited. The radar, still a problem. The helmet is too heavy. Inadequate fusion of sensor information, shortfalls in the performance distributed aperture system. That is not good. The autonomic logistics information system and other issues that are classified. And each military branch is also asking for its own distinct modifications, complicating the entire process. And its still inconclusive when the plane will be ready. The F-35 has been delayed so long it's now unclear whether the US military even needs it anymore. America's current enemies in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan don't even have air forces, and the F-35 is far more advanced than anything Russia or China have planned. Despite all of this the F-35 project keeps moving forward with enthusiastic support in the US government. In 2010 the Department of Defense allowed Lockheed more time to fix design flaws. And in 2015 Congress actually added more money to the project without the military even asking for it. That's because canceling the project would be an economic and political disaster. Thousands of jobs across the country would be lost, international relationships will be tested, and billions spent in taxpayer dollars would amount to nothing. But that's exactly why Trump's tweet was so surprising. See traditionally, defense companies negotiate projects privately with Congress and the Pentagon without any input from the president. But Trump seems to want to take a more hands-on role in contract negotiations which has completely rattled defense companies. And rightly so because while Trump can't cancel the entire program he can refuse to purchase future F-35s. And that's put a surprising degree of uncertainty in the defense industry and the US companies are scrambling to figure it out. "
152,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,c5ZtB8nLRdU,"Federal courts had previously put two different versions of the ban on hold, to resolve questions about its constitutionality and on June 26th, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban can take effect with some limitations before the High Court reviews it in the fall. The ban stops all tourists from six majority Muslim countries from entering the US for at least 90 days and all refugees for at least 120 days, unless they already have a visa or have a bona fide relationship with a person or organization in America. Trump's bans could almost be over by the time the court hears the case. Trump called the Supreme court's decision a clear victory for our national security and he did title it The Protection of the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States. After the first ban was put on hold by a judge in Washington and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Trump signed what was in his words, a quote watered-down version with the same title, but there is absolutely no evidence for such security benefit. Americans were more likely to be killed by their own clothes than by an immigrant terrorist and nobody in the US has been killed in a terrorist attack by immigrants, from these particular six nations in the last 40 years. But while the temporary bans have gotten all the headlines, the order has sent the US down a path of a fundamental shift in American refugee policy. reviewing all admitting procedures and announcing that in the future, refugees will only be admitted from countries that ensure the security and welfare of the United States. This is the opposite of how the US has defined refugees in the past. People fleeing persecution and violence that their own governments cannot or will not protect them from. And this comes at a time when the world faces its biggest refugee crisis since World War II, when 1 in 122 people are displaced. So if you're worried about US terrorist attacks like 9/11, San Bernardino, or the Orlando pulse shooting, This order would have prevented none of them. But if you happen to be afraid of Muslims, this ban might sound pretty good. It falls in line with Trump's anti-muslim statements, the most famous of which he said during the campaign Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. The attitude, that people fleeing terror, war, and famine are dangerous, that attitude resulted in the infamous decision in June 1939 to turn away the St.Louis, a ship carrying 937 Jewish Refugees fleeing another hostile government: Hitler's. First they were turned away in Cuba - the liner St. Louis turned back from Cuba, then they approached Florida but the US coast guard patrolling the waters kept them away too. They eventually disembarked in Belgium, The Netherlands, and France. Jewish unfortunates without a country permitted to land in Belgium after five weeks of suspense afloat. And hundreds died in Holocaust. Since then, the US government has been the world's leader in resettling refugees. They finally reach a haven of safety. The State Department website still brags about it, claiming three million refugees resettled around all 50 states since 1975. The Statue of Liberty bears these goals too. A plaque on the pedestal reads Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free. The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door. America hasn't always lived up to these lofty goals But since World War II, we've lived in an era where the diversity of who gets to come to America has gone up and up. Regardless of where you come from. The Trump administration has been trying to end this era since January. After multiple defeats, it's won its first battle, and seeing through this vision. Lawyers and protesters are sure to try to preserve it, around the country and this fall in the Supreme Court. "
153,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,cADiZii4X8s,"Cable news loves American weapons. Whether it’s Tomahawk missiles. Tomahawk missiles. Tomahawk cruise missiles. Or the “mother of all bombs.” MOAB, also called the “mother of all bombs” The “mother of all bombs” TV news is saturated with images of American firepower. They are beautiful pictures of fearsome armaments. But cable news’ fixation on bombs and missiles isn’t just mindless entertainment. It sanitizes violence and makes it harder to think critically about why America uses deadly force, and what happens when it does. If you watched even five minutes of cable news last month, you probably saw this. It’s the Pentagon’s footage of Tomahawk missiles being launched at a Syrian airfield from US destroyers. You couldn’t watch a segment about Syria without seeing them, even if they were just playing in the background. They were on Twitter, too, where news networks just published the Pentagon’s footage unedited and without context. There’s a reason those clips got so much airtime on news networks. On a very basic level, it’s about attracting eyeballs and having something to look at. Would you rather watch Tomahawks taking off, or would you rather watch Brian Williams? This is Deborah Jaramillo. She wrote a book on the way news networks covered and packaged the Iraq War, and she argues that cable news’ fixation on images of weapons is essentially about keeping us entertained. If we have CNN, and MSNBC, and Fox, and they’re all showing the same news, they need to differentiate their product. How do you keep viewers watching? You have a good narrative and you have spectacular visuals. You saw that happen after the US dropped the “mother of all bombs,” the MOAB, on Afghanistan. Forget the puny explosion of a single Tomahawk missile, today, the “mother of all bombs.” Tons of impressive military footage, fancy animations, and segments explaining how the bomb works. One study found that CNN aired almost an hour of MOAB test footage in the six hours after the story broke. You could almost hear the Team America theme song playing in the background. America, fuck yeah! Coming again to save the- Jaramillo saw a lot of this kind of thing during the Iraq War, like when CNN developed special graphics to teach viewers about different types of weapons. They called these graphics Baseball cards! That’s what we call them here, baseball cards. It’s got 120mm cannon, three machine guns. Now, I know what you’re thinking: A. Anderson Cooper hasn’t aged a day. And B. Who cares? Of course cable news is going to talk about weapons in war time. The problem is, when corporate media sees weapons as a product, they run the risk of sanitizing and even glamorizing tools of violence. You can see this most clearly from NBC’s Brian Williams, who fawned over the use of Tomahawk missiles like he was trying to sell them. We see these beautiful pictures. I am tempted to quote the great Leonard Cohen, “I am guided by the beauty of our weapons.” But the truth is, he wasn’t the only one giddy about the use of force. CNN, a news network, basically ran an infomercial for Tomahawk missiles. This is the newest version of the missile. Tomahawk can fly 1,000-plus miles. Each Tomahawk weighs about 3,500 pounds, so when 60 of them are fired toward Syria, that was about 210,000 pounds of firepower. So it swims and it flies. Swims and it flies. The same thing happened with the MOAB: segment after segment about how powerful the bomb was and how it worked. This is such a heavy bomb, such a large bomb. Frightening weapon, it makes a lot of noise. You would want to terrify your enemy, shock and awe. And Fox News might as well have been doing body shots the day after the bomb dropped. That is what freedom looks like: that’s the red, white, and blue. Well one of my favorite things is watching bombs drop on bad guys. The problem is compounded when news networks invite ex-military guests to talk about weapons on air, framing the discussion around how we engage in violence, rather than why. General, walk us through what is this thing and how much damage can it do. It will collapse caves, it will blow up things. And it’s guided to the target by GPS. So it’s accurate. Oh, it’s precision accurate. If you’re alive afterwards, you’re going to have perforated eardrums and a lot of trauma. The use of military analysts to explain the weapons is a way of giving us the military’s point of view and getting us to think in terms of strategy rather than in terms of people. You’ve probably noticed by now that all these clips of America’s arsenal at work have something in common: no dead bodies. You see the Tomahawk’s launching, but not the casualties they caused. You see the MOAB exploding, but it’s test footage from over a decade ago. We have video we’re showing of the testing of the bomb. That’s not an accident. Cable news has an incentive to not show the dead bodies that American weapons create. They don’t want to alienate audiences, so even when they’re dealing with something that’s very uncomfortable, like killing people overseas, they don’t have a financial incentive to show us really disturbing things when those disturbing things directly impact us or the way we feel about ourselves. Which helps explain why networks use graphics and animation so much when talking about weapons. Like this 2003 CNN clip showing how a bunker buster bomb works. You see crates and barrels being destroyed, but There are no animated figures being blown to bits, right? Further removing viewers from the actual lethal consequences of these weapons. Now, I know by this point, I probably sound like an anti-war, tree-hugging beta male, YUP. But this kind of coverage should worry you even if you think these specific strikes were justified. We can’t make informed decisions about if and when to use military force if cable news is selling us a glamorized version of what violence looks like. If we’re focused on weapons and focused on how mighty our military is, then we’re not thinking about the consequences. We’re not thinking about what happens when those weapons actually hit their targets. When you see someone like Brian Williams fawning over Tomahawk missiles, he’s not being a monster. He’s showing what happens when tools of violence become disconnected from their real consequences. When corporate media treats weapons like a product to be packaged and sold for higher ratings. "
154,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,cIsewG2g-1g,"That’s (ocean) bloom, a Radiohead and Hans Zimmer composition for BBC’s Blue Planet II series. It’s a lush, orchestral song that feels like the ebb and flow of the ocean. But it’s a rework of a 2011 Radiohead track that sounds a lot different. When Radiohead’s Thom Yorke first wrote Bloom, he was inspired by the original Blue Planet series from 2001. The song turned out to be a complex mix of piano loops and syncopated drums. In 2017, the band was brought in to adapt that track for the Blue Planet sequel with composer Hans Zimmer. This time, they were faced with a unique challenge: How do you turn an experimental rock song into a soundtrack — for the ocean? They found their inspiration in a painting technique in which small individual dots create a whole image. Pointillism, painting pointillism. And started to talk about these ideas — I used to draw exactly that after going surfing, I would do exactly that. Alright okay so we were obviously, there seems to be a consensus here that we were on the right track. And we came over here, and  just started to do these gestures withthe orchestra, these tiny little fragments of sound. Sometimes it would be like light, sometimes it would be like little waves. They sort of became the vocabulary for this. I think that was part of the idea — let's not just start with the tune, let’s start with figuring out a new technique. A new method of how to present whatever the notes are. If you listen closely to the track, you can hear that method at work — it’s a trick they call the “tidal orchestra”. This sound forms the base layer of the entire soundtrack — it’s always present. It creates a whole musical environment that’s built out of a single note. Hans has done that before — the Joker Theme in The Dark Knight is just one stretched cello note. But that was just one instrument — here, you have an entire orchestra playing a single note -- and that was made possible because of one simple rule. We instructed the players to not play at the same time when there was a long note. The conductor would say: “when the guy next to you is playing, don't play.” You can hear this when you isolate the tidal orchestra track. You know, as your note dies away, just look at you know, whoever’s sitting next to you — let them swell in their note. … And you get these beautiful sort of waves, and just for a moment the individual player is heard and then sinks back into you know, the mass. It's exactly what, if you look at the ocean long enough, that’s exactly what it does. In terms of, back to the pointillism things, it's basically, if you really look at it, it’s triangles that come in and out, and seep in and out all the time. And they never stop, they never never never stop. Think of it like a musical version of mathematician John Conway’s Game of Life — there’s a basic rule about when a note dies, when it remains, and when it reproduces. Let that play out, and the orchestra takes on an organic feeling. This track follows in a rich tradition of using randomness in music. As far back as the 1700s, compositional dice games were quite popular. Players would roll dice to generate a song based on pre-composed musical fragments, and then perform it. In 1953, composer Earle Brown wrote a piece called Twenty-Five Pages — it’s an unnumbered set of pages of music that can be played in any order, with either side up, and with notes read as either treble or bass clef. Shortly after, Karlheinz Stockhausen wrote Klavierstück XI, where a performer can pick from 19 segments randomly — the song is over after they’ve played one fragment three times. And in 1964, composer Terry Riley wrote “In C”. It’s a series of 53 short musical phrases that players can move through at their own pace, weaving in and out of sync. Music like this is called “aleatoric” — it’s when a part of the composition or performance is left up to chance, or to a player’s choices. The “Ocean Bloom” rework makes those choices available on an orchestral level, but it's an effect that was already part of the original Radiohead track. You can hear it when you take away the drums, which is exactly what Thom did at a performance in Paris in 2016. I thought hang on, maybe I can do it on piano and came up with a way of really crude way to play on piano. Which was kind of discovering the song again, in a super simple way. Because up until that point, it had always been about the rhythms that shift in and out, and fall apart. Fall apart. Sometimes come together if we're lucky. Usually fall apart. It's very interesting hearing Thom talk about the piano version, because that had a similar sort of, degree of randomness, building all those loops on the piano. Didn't know what I was doing. You see the song in a different way. It’s interesting how such a small scale thing that Thom is doing is sort of — you’re subconsciously doing the same thing. But with a huge orchestra. As soon as you have an orchestra involved, the complexity of that, all these players playing together, that’s the glorious thing. There’s no sound like it. I think that's why it sounds so vital. Blue Planet II airs from October 29th on BBC One in the UK and is coming soon to BBC America in 2018. "
155,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,cMkHcZ5IwjU,"These are satellite images from the deserts of western China. Look closely, and you'll see these huge complexes being built. From the sky, they sort of look like factories or even schools. But look even closer: this line is one facility’s perimeter wall. And these shadows? They’re cast by the watchtowers along the wall. This compound isn’t a school or a factory. It’s an internment camp. Inside these camps, the Chinese government is detaining as many as 1 million Uighurs, China’s mostly Muslim minority. China doesn't want the world to know any of this. But the story of these camps is also the story of how we know about them - and China's efforts to cover them up. As soon as we began to document the re-education centers, there was Chinese government officials deleting what we were finding. Uighurs mainly live here, in the Xinjiang province of northwestern China. That puts them closer to the capitals of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan than to Beijing. And Uighurs are also closer culturally to those Turkic groups than they are to the Han Chinese, China’s ethnic majority. The Uighurs speak a Turkic language. Their culture is different. They have particular styles of music, a whole a whole rich history that is unique to them. This is Sigal Samuel, a reporter at Vox. I've been reporting on the Uighur crisis in China for about a year now. China has been concerned for decades about the possibility of Uighur separatism. Uighurs have actually had their own independent nation, two separate times in the last century. In 1933, they established the Islamic Republic of East Turkistan here in Kashgar. But it crumbled less than a year later when it was taken over by Chinese forces. Then, in 1944, the Soviet Union backed the creation of the East Turkestan Republic, based here. But when China became Communist in 1949, the Soviet Union turned on East Turkestan, and helped China take it over again. Part of why the Xinjiang region is so important to China is that it’s rich with energy resources. And as China’s economy grew, so did its need for energy. Today Xinjiang accounts for nearly 40% of China’s coal reserves. And over 20% of the country’s oil and gas. It also accounts for 20% of China’s potential for wind energy. China needs resources, it needs energy. It needs the geographical location, the area on which Xinjiang sits. That's where Uighurs are. That's where they're living. And so China really wants to have a solid sense of control over that area. As far back as the 1950s, China saw an opportunity to dilute the influence of the potentially rebellious Uighurs, and started encouraging the migration of Han Chinese, into Xinjiang. And it worked. In 1945, Uighurs made up over 80% of the population, compared to just 6% Han Chinese. By 2008, Xinjiang was 46% Uighur compared to 39% Han Chinese. But over the years, as Xinjiang developed economically, Uighurs were left behind, working mostly low-wage jobs in agriculture while the Han held higher-paying jobs. Finally, in 2009, a Uighur protest against discrimination at the hands of the Han and the Chinese government erupted in violence. “Bloody riots broke out, pitting ethnic Uighur Muslims against the dominant Han Chinese.” One of the worst riots took place in the provincial capital of Urumqi. About 200 people were killed and hundreds injured during the unrest. That was sort of an inflection point. After that, the Chinese really started to crack down harder on the Uighurs. And by 2013, Xinjiang had become even more important to China. The country launched the “Belt and Road” initiative, a trillion-dollar investment in things like fiber optic cables, train lines, and gas pipelines meant to boost the country’s economic and political influence around the world by making it easier to trade with China. If you plot these projects on a map you’ll see a lot of them pass through Xinjiang, making the province arguably the most important corridor for the whole project. China would need to ensure that Xinjiang remained securely in its hands. The Uighurs came to be perceived and painted more as a threat, as a separatist threat, as an extremist threat. In 2016 and 2017, the country enacted a series of “de-extremification” policies aimed at Muslims, like banning long beards. And Xinjiang was effectively turned into a hi-tech police state. So this kind of thing is happening all over the country, but in Xinjiang it's been just increased by orders of magnitude. We're talking about Uighurs having to hand over their phones at checkpoints. We're even talking about QR codes being installed on the outside of their homes. But the most brutal part of this crackdown was hidden to the world at first. In this image you see the opening of this facility. The signage, it says ""De-extremification reeducation center."" Around 2017, China started building these internment camps, these large scale places to detain Uighurs. China says that these camps are necessary because the Uighurs are a terrorist threat. A separatist threat. People who are infected with extremist thinking. But it wasn’t until Uighurs who had been detained told their stories, that the picture from inside the camps came into clearer focus. They're forced to memorize and recite Communist Party propaganda every day. They're often forced to criticize their own Islamic beliefs and to criticize the beliefs of their fellow detainees. “We had to sing songs hailing the Communist Party. We had to repeat in Chinese, ‘long live [Chinese president] Xi Jinping! There have been reports of death, of torture. “Three guards surrounded me and abused me. ""Each time I was electrocuted, my whole body would shake."" So there's this atmosphere of just trying to uproot what you believe in. At first, China denied the existence of  these camps... But activists and academics fought back. A lot of people around the world are scouring the Internet for evidence of China's internment camps for Uighurs. In terms of the strategies and tools that I've used and others have used to uncover evidence of these camps, it's quite simply a computer and knowledge of Chinese and thinking about what ways whats words, especially government websites, would use. People have unearthed government documents... ""And then we had growing visual evidence. We're looking at satellite images."" We could actually trace the creation and expansion of the reeducation camp. It was a matter of, I think luck or chance I uncovered this image. And until then, we didn't have that piece of visual evidence that said this is what it is. And this is what the Chinese government's calling it. Tim isn’t alone. There’s a whole network of “web sleuths” around the world using basic internet tools to document what China doesn’t want the world to see. And they’ve gotten China to change their story, at least a little. China was denying that these re education centers exist, until journalists and academics and others started to really amass a body of evidence that was so convincing that China couldn't just deny it anymore. China took a different approach and started admitting that these facilities exist, but carefully painted them as training schools for potential criminals or terrorists. In the meantime, the camps are still there and growing. This camp, one of China’s largest, was as big as the nearby city of Dabancheng in 2017. But by 2018, the camp had expanded to twice the size. From China's perspective they think it's worth it. They want to make sure Xinjiang is an area of the country that they have total control over. And if that comes with a high human cost and even a reputational blow on the international stage, China so far seems willing to do that anyway. "

According to the Pentagon there have been 33 broken arrows in history of our nuclear program. That's the official number. But I feel very confident in saying it's a lot more than 33. ""There is a ball of fire. It has reached a point 1 mile above the earth."" This technology has constantly been on the verge of slipping out of our control. The very first test of a nuclear device in 1945 in the desert of New Mexico could have ended catastrophically. J Robert Oppenheimer who was the scientific director of the Manhattan Project got worried someone might try to sabotage it so he asked a young scientist, Donald Hornig, to climb to the top of the shot tower – a hundred foot steel tower – and quote babysit the bomb. You've got a young scientist atop a hundred foot steel tower and a totally flat desert. ""It was a deeply philosophical experience"" Now while Donald morning was up there an incredible lightning storm occurred There's no doubt that if lightning had struck that tower or near that tower that device would have most likely detonated and this young scientist would have been the first victim of the nuclear era. ""An atomic bomb breaks loose from a mounting shackle in a b-47 jet over Florence South Carolina, plummets to earth, causing a sensational freak accident."" I got a document through the Freedom of Information Act that lists more than a thousand accidents and incidents involving nuclear weapons just between 1950 and 1968. Palomares, Spain. During aerial refueling the tanker and the bomber had a collision and it dropped four hydrogen bombs over Spain. Damascus, Arkansas. A workman drops a tool in a missile silo. The tool hits the missile causes a fuel leak and on top of the missile is the most powerful nuclear warhead the United States has ever built. Maintenance work is being done on an atomic bomb and the worker doesn't realize that one of the pins in the plug of the testing equipment is bent when he plugs the pin into the atomic bomb it fully armed the bomb and nearly detonates the bomb which would have destroyed a large part of the Florida coast. So. ""Although a beautiful sight this swirling boiling mushroom cloud is certain death"" One of the problems with complex technological systems is you never know where a potentially catastrophic problem can begin. Our principal nuclear bomber is the b-52 and we haven't built a b-52 since John F Kennedy was president. That was a long time ago. And what concerns me most is the infrastructure. The wiring the cables computers in our launch control centers that rely on eight inch floppy disks. We're very good at creating complex technological systems. Not as good at managing them and not very good at all when something goes wrong with it. "

""We're getting reports of multiple casualties in a roadside..."" He killed at least 40 Indian soldiers here in Kashmir. ""The deadliest attack the region has seen this century."" The bomber was part of an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan. ""Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for that attack."" 12 days later, India carried out airstrikes in Northwestern Pakistan. Then Pakistan shot down at least one Indian aircraft around here. Tensions rose between the two rival nations. [""Escalate"" repeated in news broadcasts.] ""The most serious escalation in years."" Kashmir is one of the most disputed places on Earth. Over the course of 70 years, it’s been at the center of three wars fought between two massive armies. It's heavily occupied by more than half a million Indian troops and a deadly collection of militias and terrorist groups. Kashmir is the stage for the relentless conflict between India and Pakistan. But focusing on the two countries can obscure what's really at stake: The voice of Kashmiris who are caught in a vicious cycle of violence. Kashmir is one of the most strategic places in the world, where 3 powerful countries collide: India, Pakistan, and China. China invaded and took this slice of Kashmir from India. And was given this one by Pakistan. India and Pakistan control these parts, but lay claim to more. This region is at the center of a brutal conflict over these disputed borders. So it's important to start when they were being drawn. In the mid-1800s, India was a patchwork of several hundred provinces and princely states under British rule. A century later, when British India won independence, the British left and hastily decided to split the region into two. These areas would be a new Muslim-majority country, Pakistan. And this would be the mostly Hindu, but secular, India. The partition was bloody. ""Communal hatred flares up in the Punjab."" ""1 million people become refugees overnight."" ""They flee from savagery and butchery that has never been exceeded, even in India's stormy history."" Amid the chaos, some princely states were given the choice to join either country. In most cases, the ruling monarchs followed the will of their people. But this state, called ""Jammu &amp; Kashmir"" was different. It was right along this new border and had a Muslim-majority population, but was ruled by a Hindu monarch. When asked to pick a side, the ruler chose to stay neutral Fearing that the monarch would join India, the Kashmiri population rebelled here in 1947 Armed tribesmen from Pakistan soon joined the fight. The monarch turned to India for military help and in exchange agreed to join them, which sparked the first Indo-Pakistan war in Kashmir. ""Continuing thus increased the threat to world peace and brought the dispute to the attention of the United Nations. The UN Security Council brokered a ceasefire in 1949, which established this line with Pakistan controlling this side and India this one. It also asked Pakistani tribesmen to withdraw and Indian troops to follow, so that Kashmir could hold a direct vote to decide its own future. But neither held up their end of the deal. Pakistan argued that Kashmir’s Muslim-majority population rightfully belonged with them. While India insisted that Kashmir was handed over to them by the Hindu monarch. So they doubled down and added Kashmir to their constution. Both countries continued to tighten their grip around it for decades. ""Kashmir. Fighting is going on and heavy casualties in men and equipment have been inflicted on the aggressor."" In 1965, the second India-Pakistan war broke out in Kashmir. Thousands of people were killed between the huge armies on both sides. A ceasefire ended the war, but didn’t change this line. Kashmir was kept divided and occupied. And another war broke out in 1971. This time the focus wasn't in Kashmir — it was in East Pakistan. Here, India helped rebels fight for independence and dealt Pakistan a devastating defeat. This region became a new country, Bangladesh, and Pakistan lost its eastern half. This made Kashmir more important than ever: It became one of the most militarized places on Earth, as India and Pakistan deployed planes, tanks, artillery, and soldiers along the Line of Control. On the political front, in '87, India reportedly rigged an election, declaring a pro-India party as the winner. Now this was a big turning point for many Kashmiris, who felt they were again denied the chance to vote. Thousands took to the streets in Indian-controlled Kashmir to protest the occupation. But India met the movement for independence with harsh resistance. Which quickly escalated to more violence. ""In January security forces opened fire on demonstrating separatists, turning a two-year old struggling movement into a full-blown popular uprising."" ""More than 600 people have been killed in clashes between troops and separatists."" Kashmiri militias, like the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front, started recruiting Muslim youth to fight for independence. And increasingly attacked the Indian military. Pakistan saw an opportunity in this insurgency. They helped introduce a new kind of militant group: Radical Islamic fighters who fought for a more pro-Pakistan Kashmir. By the mid '90s, these groups dominated the insurgency. India responded with incredible military force, deploying 500,000 troops to Kashmir. And they cracked down on militants and protestors. Unarmed civilians were killed and many more were forced to flee the violence. And in '98 the stakes were raised yet again. ""Today India conducted three underground nuclear tests."" ""Pakistan today successfully conducted five nuclear tests."" Kashmir became a battleground between two nuclear-armed nations and another war broke out in 1999. ""More evidence of the attacks being launched on the Indian-controlled area of Kargil."" ""The past two days have seen some of the fiercest fighting so far."" ""Militant Muslim fighters have also crossed over into some parts of Indian-ruled Kashmir."" The 1999 war ended with another ceasefire, but that didn't stop either country. Over the years, Pakistan’s militant groups got bolder and launched terror attacks in Kashmir and outside of Kashmir. In 2001, members of Lashkar-e-Taiba bombed India’s parliament building in New Delhi killing 14 people. And in 2008, 10 militants from  the same group killed 174 people and wounded 300 in Mumbai. Meanwhile, Indian military cracked down in Kashmir, firing bullets and pellets on unarmed protesters. Leaving hundreds wounded and blind. This is the vicious cycle of violence. The Indian Army’s crackdown drives some Kashmiris to join Pakistani-backed militant groups, who carry out violence against the Indian forces. It’s a cycle that Kashmiri civilians are stuck in the middle of. Which brings us back to 2019. The suicide bomber was 19-year old Adil Ahmed Dar from Pulwama, Kashmir. According to his parents, in 2016, Indian police officers stopped him and humiliated him by forcing his face into the ground. The same year he was shot in the leg at a protest. The next year, Dar left home with his brothers, to join Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistani-supported militia that radicalized him and trained him to be a suicide bomber. A year later, he drove explosives into an Indian military convoy. For more than 70 years India and Pakistan have driven a cycle of violence, retaliation, and exploitation in Kashmir. But beneath it all is the Kashmiri's wish to make a choice. A wish that continues to be suppressed, again and again, by violence. "
158,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,e31fNccOQSE,"Superheroes are mass culture, but comic books are niche. Tens of millions of people saw Captain America: Civil War, but this past May, Marvel only sold 177,000 copies of Civil War II. But if you took Marvel’s opening credits and replaced this with this, even the people who’d never touched a comic book page..would notice. Everybody knows the “comic book font.” How could there be a universally recognized font for something that, for a half century, was written by hand? Is it a font at all? How is that possible? These fonts are made by people called “letterers.” And their work shows how hundreds of lettering artists can come together into a single recognizable style. And how we, as consumers, then manage to get it completely wrong. If you go to a comic book store, you can see comics that were gloriously lettered by hand, like this 1964 issue of Thor. (Yes, it was a Stan Lee and Jack Kirby production.) And they worked with Artie Simek. Artie probably gave Thor this epic WHOOM. Letterers place and draw expressive dialogue bubbles like this one. But in Artie’s day, they also hand wrote every word in a dialogue bubble. And a lot of practical conditions shaped the artistry of the letters. “What I think of as comic book lettering is 1960s Marvel comics. They were mainly lettered by two guys: Artie Simek and Sam Rosen. For me, they kind of nailed it.” That’s John Roshell, who founded Comicraft, a comic book font company, with Richard Starkings. They’re letterers and writers, and they make fonts like this one and comics like this one. The fonts they design imitate a style that formed out of necessity. That style came out of the newspaper world and newspaper technology. Early comics like “Little Nemo,” which came out in the 1900s, started to develop a style that was readable on cheap paper. You can see it forming in this bubble — it’s all caps, like a comic book font, but it’s somehow...wrong. As time went on, that changed. “Certainly early on, comic strips and comic books were lettered by the artist. As they gained popularity, that’s when the production model started to get split up, basically to meet the demand. The letterer was probably just somebody in the office who had good handwriting, who could do it fast enough.” But the form’s limitations shaped the style that emerged across the industry. Most letterers used an Ames guide like this one to create their lines, which meant each letter hit the same height and, more likely, hit middle in the middle of the line. These letters became kind of squat because they’re really trying to hit the lines on the top and bottom of the guide. That led to generally rounder Os and fatter As with lower crosses. Earlier letterers also used a Speedball Nib pen or a technical pen. These things here: they’re nibs. They determine a letter’s shape, and an artist could use any type they wanted. But a lot of the time, they chose nibs that gave them a consistent stroke width. Compare this “Loki” to one that shows up in Times New Roman. Now look at the Times one. It has a skinny base on the L, a very narrow O at the top, and all sorts of other little details where the stroke width varies. Arti Simek’s Loki, however, has a really consistent width to it. The quality of the pages also influenced the style that letterers chose. Here’s that 1964 Thor next to Thor from 2016. Just look at the difference between the pages. Today’s glossy Thor can handle all sorts of letters, but 1964’s couldn’t. Letterers wrote in all caps to compensate. Look at this ad from 1964’s Thor. The ink is blotchy and hard to read. All caps helps fix that. And see how the tail on the y and g forces that whole line to be longer? All caps helped letterers fit more dialogue into less space, and keep it clear on lousy paper. Other rules emerged too. Never cross an I, unless it’s by itself, always italicize and bold for emphasis — and all of them were made to make comics printed on bad paper easier to read. Consistency also mattered in case another letterer jumped in to finish a page or fix up a typo. And all those constraints and choices created the handwritten style we recognize. But today to call it handwriting would be lying. Richard Starkings, who runs Comicraft with John Roshell, was frustrated with the work involved in lettering. This is the Killing Joke, it’s a classic, controversial 80s comic that’s been reprinted in deluxe editions. And Richard Starkings lettered it. Starkings had an experienced letterer’s appreciation of detail. He was frustrated by the work involved in lettering, and an industry that knew that computers were the future, but wasn’t willing to go there just yet. There’d been earlier attempts to standardize fonts in comics — most famously a publisher called EC comics used a guide to trace every letter, and the result ended up looking kind of mechanical, like type. Other publishers played with type too. But Starkings and Roshell led the charge into digital fonts. “For a long time we had things our way because there were a lot of technophobes in comics. There were a lot of people who didn’t want to change. Those people have grown old and there are people in their 20s editing and designing comics now, and they expect you to have every font in our library and then some.” Today, companies like Comicraft and competitors like Blambot make fonts that letterers can download and then work with in programs like Adobe Illustrator. They still make the bubbles and design the text — they just don’t use ink to do it. But those companies don’t just sell one “comic book font.” They sell a ton. And that’s because the idea of a “comic book font” is a mistake in the first place. The general public only really became aware of fonts with the rise of personal computers. This chart shows the appearances of the word “font” in books from 1960 to 2000. We can see Helvetica, and Arial, and Futura because our computers have trained us to look for them. Some fonts came with our machines or condensed in the document cloud. We notice them. We see these tiny differences. There have always been hundreds of “comic book fonts” too, attuned to the idiosyncrasies of the artists who used to letter them. But most people, just like me, haven’t been trained to see the nuance in their work. Comics fans and letterers do. “That’s a Todd Klein R. Different letterers have their letters of the alphabet that are kind of their signature.” “Dave Gibbons, his D and his G, his G is almost a six, it’s a real loop around on itself.” Even Richard Starkings has a quirk — a jagged hook on the S that always stands out. As technology allows for variety and ease of use, creativity continues to flourish, even if handwriting gets digitized. Comics like Klaus can use color with abandon, and artsy comics like The Joyners are able to experiment with all kinds of fonts without worrying about cheap paper reducing readability. The “comic book font” is a starting point — an idea we keep around because it shows the verve of comics. Within that style is the variety of different artists and designers, expressing a key element in every story. And maybe even some of those superhero movie fans will notice it. So in addition to identifying a letterer by their handwriting, sometimes you can spot one by the style of their bubbles. John Workman is famous for creating word bubbles that jut right into the gutter of a page, and it creates a really distinctive style that’s easy to spot. "
159,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,e681QNbHloE,"Imagine it's 1980. Mullets are cool. The Empire Strikes Back is playing in theaters. And International Business Machines or IBM is the world's dominant technology firm. It embodies the American Dream with a progressive agenda of equal opportunity and prides itself on a stable workforce. It's so thrilling to see the new IBM personal system - in the hands of an old master. According to this handbook in over 40 years, full-time employees haven't been touched by layoffs. People are a treasured resource and are treated like one. Fast forward to the present. ProPublica estimates IBM has eliminated 20,000 American employees age 40 and over in just the past five years. That's about 60 percent of its estimated US job cuts during that time. How did IBM go from valuing its older workforce to systematically getting rid of them? Through the '80s, technology started shifting rapidly. Among other things, Apple introduced the first Macintosh and took a direct shot at IBM. It appears IBM wants it all. By the early 2000's IBM fell further as new rivals like Google, Facebook, and Amazon took the lead. In our world the speed and tempo of modern living are increasing at an ever-accelerating rate. And as it slipped, IBM had to deal with something most of these competitors didn't have: a large number of experienced and aging employees. They reacted to new setbacks with layoffs and many of them were older workers. ProPublica heard from over 1,400 former IBM employees. Here's what we know. In making staff cuts, IBM has side-stepped US laws and regulations intended to protect workers from age discrimination. In the past, they would get two lists from IBM. One that had ages of people staying and another with ages of those being let go. In 2014 IBM stopped giving that information. On top of that, the company required people to sign away their rights to sue for age discrimination in court, in exchange for their severance packages. By signing the documents, laid-off employees waived the right to go to court. They could only pursue their age cases through confidential arbitration. They also have to do it solo, so they couldn't combine forces with other workers who may be claiming similar age discrimination. Studies show arbitration overwhelmingly favors employers. Workers win only 19% of the time, when their cases are arbitrated versus 36% of the time when they go to federal court and 57% in state courts. IBM has also laid off and fired some older workers with review techniques that effectively made their age a disadvantage. Take the case of one business unit that was using a point system to evaluate workers. The more points a person got, the more protected they were from negative changes to employment. But the system itself appeared biased. Employees were given points for being relatively new at a job level, so those who worked there fewer years earned more points than long time IBMers. The bias against older workers is evident when you compare the number of points to years of service. Those with no points worked there an average of more than thirty years. Those with higher points average fifteen years. But the numbers don't reflect worker skills. 80% of older, more long-term employees, the ones with lower points, were rated by the company itself as ""good enough to stay at current job levels or be promoted"", while only a small percentage of younger employees with high numbers had similar ratings. They've also converted many layoffs into retirements, forcing ex-employees to accept a retirement package or leave with no benefits. They've told remote workers, including older ones who had worked from home for years, to relocate to offices potentially thousands of miles away from their homes. Their options were relocate or resign. In response to all of these findings IBM has said ""we are proud of our company and our employees ability to reinvent themselves era after era while always complying with the law."" The problem is protection for workers under the law is eroding. In the past few decades, rulings in age discrimination cases have said former employees must prove that there were no factors other than age involved in their job changes, but companies like IBM have made it near impossible to prove that. With nearly 400,000 employees worldwide, IBM is still a tech giant. And how it handles its older workforce could encourage other companies to follow suit, even though a lot of these companies have a younger workforce now. Here's the thing about aging: it happens to everyone "
160,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,eZSe4xVXHhI,"There’s this moment at the Oscars, right before La La Land was mistakenly awarded Best Picture, where you can really tell that whatever Warren Beatty is looking at doesn’t make sense. ""For Best Picture..."" ""You're impossible."" He knew something was wrong, but he wasn’t sure. But here’s an idea: what if better typography could have prevented this whole snafu? Let’s walk through what that could have looked like. We know from this shot that the announcement card looks something like this. The card is serving two purposes: on one hand, it’s a beautiful souvenir for the winner, and on the other hand, it’s a cue card for a very high-pressure public presentation. So how do you make this easier to read in front of 30 million live viewers? Let’s look at how the card compares to the line that the announcer has to say. We read things from top to bottom, but at the top is “Oscars”... that’s not useful information for the people on stage... at the Oscars. ""That’s like a few milliseconds of extra time that those presenters have to go through when they're presenting, they have to go through all this information. That’s benjamin bannister, he’s a graphic designer who put together an alternate design for the announcement card. ""It’s like driving on the side of the road, you literally have a few seconds to read all the information on the signs, or else you're going to make a wrong turn.” ‘Best Actress’ should be the first thing on the page. Make it a little easier to read, and now, the presenters have a clear sign that they’ve got the wrong card. But this still treats the winner with the same emphasis as the movie they appeared played in, which, while it’s nice to have, is really just extra context. You solve that by making the name of the winner the biggest thing on the page. If the presenters were given this card, one of two things would have happened: their eyes would have first read “Best Actress,” or “Emma Stone”. Not La La Land. You can apply the same fix to the card that prompted Steve Harvey to crown the wrong person Miss Universe in 2015. No bad typography, no confusion, no embarrassing mix-up. The consequences of bad graphic design extend far beyond award shows. In the fall of 2000, the supervisor of elections for Palm Beach County, Florida was tasked with designing a ballot with more candidates than could fit on a single column. It wound up looking like this — it was called a “butterfly ballot” because of the way the text occupied two columns. If you were voting for Bush, this form made enough sense — to pick the first candidate, you punched in the first bubble. But then, to vote for the second candidate on the list, Al Gore, you had to punch in the third bubble. See the problem? The Palm Beach Post estimated that over 2,800 Gore voters accidentally voted for Pat Buchanan. ""A number of voters here in Palm Beach County have filed lawsuits asking for a new election because they claim they either voted for the wrong candidate or double punched their ballots because of confusion over the ballot design."" Bush won Florida by a margin of 537 votes. Better typography here arguably could have changed US history. Graphic designer Michael Beirut put together this version of what that ballot could have looked like. It uses the same format, but consolidates information horizontally, so that you can fit all the same candidate names in the same amount of space. Instead of there being two conflicting visual paths to follow, there’s just one. There’s also a lesson here for public health. When it comes to health, there’s probably no single piece of household typographic design that’s as common as this one: the orange prescription bottle. These have been around since just after World War II, and they haven’t changed much apart from the addition of a child-safety cap in the 1970s. But they’re not the easiest things to read. Just look at how information is prioritized here. The pharmacy branding is often the first and biggest thing on the label, which is fairly unimportant information for the user. The rest of the text on the label is small, and it’s all the same size and weight. Even these confusing numbers, which the user doesn’t need at all, get the same amount of emphasis as everything else. On top of that, some key warnings are printed on hard-to-read color combinations, like black on dark red. Put all of that on a curved bottle that you have to rotate to read, and you’re left with a pretty unfriendly design. A design student named Deborah Adler, created a model for what a new and improved pill bottle could look like. She called it Clear Rx — she was inspired after her grandmother took her grandfather’s medicine by accident. And it’s a common problem. Experts estimate there are 500,000 cases per year in the U.S. of people misreading prescription bottle instructions. In Adler’s design, The branding moves to the bottom, and the most important information for the user is big at the top. Adler also included color-coded rings, so that the packaging clearly distinguishes between users, not just between medications. The extra surface area on the back allows for space to be dedicated to warnings for the user. Target bought this design and rolled it out in 2005 to positive reception. But 10 years after that, Target sold its pharmacy business to CVS, and the new pill bottle disappeared. Stories emerged afterward that some users had actually fished their old Target bottles out of the trash because of how much they liked them. Others took to Twitter. CVS has said that it’s developing a new, similar model — but it hasn’t released it yet. As with a lot of designs, it’s hard to notice the things that are done well until they aren’t there anymore. “I think it was a good moment to show people and educate them on the fact that design does matter. And most people seem to forget, and say it’s not a big deal. Until something like this happens. Designers are there to prevent things like this from happening.” So would different typography have totally changed outcomes in any of these cases? Maybe. But if you’re Warren Beatty or Steve Harvey or Al Gore — that’s a pretty big “maybe.” "
161,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,fD91dTeEzqE,"There’s a common sort of idea out there that Trump is a toddler, he’s a child Acting like a toddler, having a major meltdown...acting as a child...the mind of a toddler...he’s a giant toddler, and there’s nothing going around inside his head And what people mean by that, I think, is that he has poor impulse control. Something the way he’s wired, where he can’t help himself...can’t seem to help himself...he can’t control himself...he just can’t seem to help himself, Howie! And it’s a way, it seems to me, of trivializing some of the wrongdoing that you see from Donald Trump. When he said to Billy Bush, He’s not saying he doesn’t understand the consequences of his actions, he’s saying that based on his experience in life, there will not be consequences. And that’s actually really different from a child’s perspective on the world. A real toddler misbehaves all the time. I mean, José, earlier this week, he stuck his foot in a serving bowl. He sometimes likes to try to attack small birds at the park. But if you explain the rules to him, he normally follows them. It’s a constructive process. And Trump is...old. He’s been around. He's not learning. Donald Trump is a man who has had a lot of different brushes with the law. The very first time he appeared in the New York Times, it was because there was a federal investigation into illegal racial discrimination in houses that he was running. Soon after the election he paid a $25 million settlement for defrauding students at a fake university. The first time he tried to move beyond the real estate business, he had a casino in Atlantic City, the Trump Taj Mahal. He build the casino with a lot of loans, a lot of debts, And in December of 1990, he comes to this moment of crisis where he doesn’t have the funds to make the payment, if he can't cover the interest. So what happens is his father sends one of the family attorneys down in a car to Atlantic City with over 3 million dollars. And he has him go buy chips from the casino, giving cash to the Taj Mahal So in effect, that’s a loan And eventually, the New Jersey Gaming Authorities ruled, and he had to pay a fine for it. But if you look at the balance of considerations, right If he hadn’t taken the illegal loan, he would have lost the whole casino. With the illegal loan, he pays a fine, but it’s not that big of a fine, and he keeps the casino. And that’s basically the impunity lifestyle of Donald Trump: this calculated decision was made that to break the rules would be better for Donald Trump, even if he got caught. Looking for loopholes, and working with smart lawyers to find them is what you’re supposed to do. We have very much normalized a culture of rule breaking in American business, And Trump is an extreme example of that, but extremes tell you something about what’s going on beneath the surface. "
162,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,fd8reN4uoBM,"A heinous crime has been committed at Vox. Somebody keeps drinking the single source Ethiopian yirgacheffe coffee I bring to the office for myself. I rounded up five suspects from around the office and fingerprinted them to see if I could find a match from a print I found on my mug. Is fingerprint analysis reliable enough to pin somebody to this unspeakable crime, and more importantly ... uhhhh ... how do you actually do this? To help me figure out what the hell I’m supposed to do I brought in an expert. My name is Peter Valentin. I'm an expert in crime scene reconstruction and forensic science. A fingerprint is probably the most important piece of information when we don't have a known connection between the victim and the offender. We have to find something that people leave at scenes relatively easily and something that is unique enough that finding it and identifying what it is will lead us back to the person. In order to find a fingerprint investigators will either use a physical component like a powder– So not cocoa powder? Cool cool cool. Or a series of chemicals that make a print visible on a surface. Our fingerprints have ridges and furrows that align to create unique, recognizable patterns. There is a what's called a loop right here, you have ridges that are coming into the pattern and then coming back out. Here's another loop right here. There's arches, and there's whorls and those those three categories alone comprise at least 95 percent of the fingerprints that are in the database. Everyone’s fingerprints have unique features that differentiate them from everyone else’s. For instance this ridge splits into two here and this ridge has a break in it. These patterns remain the same throughout a person's lifetime, which makes them a powerful identification tool. My fingerprint is pretty easy to spot. The pattern looks like a 1998 Chrysler Sebring. Investigators rely on the characteristics of a print to find a match using a method called ACE-V. First they analyze the print and the surface it's on to see if it's viable for examination. This one’s great. This one, not so much. Then, they take the suitable print and compare it against known fingerprints looking for points of similarities and differences. For example both these patterns are whorls and bifurcate right here. Investigators look at these traits and try to gauge if there’s enough points of comparison to declare it a match. Finally, a qualified peer reviews their conclusion to verify the match. After using high tech software to analyze the prints from my mug – I’m kidding this is just some stock footage I downloaded. I think I finally found a match. But, ok, even when it’s done by professionals... how reliable is fingerprint analysis? It's a useful tool that obviously has value, but I think it's problematic to overstate its value especially in a criminal justice context. One accuracy study found that examiners made false positive identifications in .1% of cases. Which means identifying a print as a match when it’s not. That doesn’t sound too bad... unless you happen to be one of those false positives. Brandon Mayfield, a lawyer from Oregon, was one of those unlucky few. He was falsely accused of the 2004 Madrid train bombing because the FBI made a false positive match with a partial print found at the scene. Mayfield seemed like a good suspect to investigators because he had recently converted to Islam and was the lawyer for a man who attempted to join the Taliban, which in the wake of 9/11 were all red flags for the FBI. There was a bias that existed because once they tentatively identified the unknown fingerprint as belonging to this individual who he was and what his background was made the identification seem stronger than it actually was. He didn't have a valid passport. So it's a little implausible on the face of it that he was handling a bag of detonators in Spain. Fingerprinting was so powerful that it just sort of it trumped everything else. Mayfield was even given his own analyst who examined the prints, and even they agreed that it was a match. That's an interesting thing about bias because, you know, everybody's assumption is that the experts are biased toward the side that they're working for. Here was a guy who was working for Mayfield and yet he corroborated the evidence against him which turned out to be incorrect. The FBI released a 330-page report about where their analysts went wrong, and it’s pretty much a case study in a lot of the potential downfalls of fingerprinting. They cited things such as, ignoring differences between the prints, lack of independent verification, the pressure of working on a high profile terrorism investigation, and letting bias about the suspect affect their analysis. Their report summed it up by saying “in any human endeavor, there is a potential for error.” You know I would suggest learning from history and realizing that none of these things are going to be error free. So there's going to be mistakes and errors and screw ups. But also evidence is inherently probabilistic. So even though it’s not a perfect tool, until a more reliable technology emerges, law enforcement will continue to utilize fingerprint analysis. And I won’t ever be fully certain of who stole my coffee. Until I catch him on this new surveillance camera that I installed. "
163,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,fkCxpF9mFbc," Every few months, this debate flares up. It's about women who work, which is to say, most women. About how tough it can be succeed at work and still feel like a good mom. And we often ask, what can governments or corporations do to promote work-family balance? But what if we started thinking smaller? What if one part of the solution was men doing more at home? [music transition] Between 1950 and 2000, the share of women in the US workforce jumped from 34% to 60%. But women were still expected to do most of the work when it came to raising kids and running a house. Goldscheider: ""The second shift of women working and taking care of the home was very stressful for the family."" That stress is partially what led to the trope of the frazzled working mom. ""I don't know how she does it."" People started to blame working women for the high divorce rates in the 1970s and 80s. And now, with fewer people getting married and  having kids, it’s still popular to pit working women against family. &lt;&lt;Venker on Fox News: ""If you were a real feminist, you would support housewives and see them as the heroes and women who work, wasting their time."" ""Do you all think working moms still get treated unfairly?"" But while the stress of the second shift may have contributed to divorce at first, things are changing. New research is showing that men and women who share responsibilities at home are happier than those in more traditional marriages. Goldschnieder: ""Where men become more involved in the family....they’re more attractive as a partner, they are less likely to divorce, they’re more likely to have children"" Heterosexual couples in which men do more household chores are less likely to divorce. And the more time men spend with their children, the more satisfied both partners say they are with the relationship. Take couples who have kids, but aren’t married. In those relationships, men who were more involved with caring for the kids were more likely to make the transition to marriage compared those who were less involved. So maybe someday that iconic “frazzled working mom” trope will go the way of the fifties housewife: a symbol of a time when women, and men, were trapped inside a narrow definition of what it meant to be a partner and a parent.

164,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,gOGDDh1thaQ,"There are two kinds of people in this world. Ones who see this painting and think: genius. And ones who think: how did Jackson Pollock get so overrated? Wait, a second Jackson. I am actually the first type. The type that really likes you. Don’t put that cigarette out in my eye. I love abstract expressionism and I love Pollock. When I see Pollock in person, I am full on Cameron in Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. What time is it? But even fans like me have to admit that Pollock brings up questions. Questions beyond snark about why Jackson Pollock’s studio floor looks identical to his paintings. Why is Pollock the one who gets his paintings put under a microscope? Why does Pollock get to be Ed Harris’s passion project? There’s one answer that’s beyond the paint. This is artist Lee Krasner, Jackson Pollock’s wife, and Jackson, enjoying time in Springs, New York. But it’s the man in between them who might be the key to understanding how Jackson Pollock became a legend. Here’s a young Jackson Pollock at his mentor, Thomas Hart Benton’s, house. Yep, he has a drink in his hand. Most people agree Pollock’s big break came in 1943, with “Mural,” which he painted for heiress Peggy Guggenheim. It’s got bold colors and motion. Pollock later said it was like “a stampede of every animal in the American West.” Pollock’s birthplace of Cody, Wyoming helped sell that. Later he pioneered placing the canvas on the ground and throwing paint down at it. That helped him become a mainstream success, with Life Magazine articles and Vogue fashion shoots with his paintings in the background, as well as the classic, icon-building Hans Namuth film and photos that showed the brooding cowboy artist at work. “I usually paint on the floor. I enjoy working on a large canvas.” But here’s the problem. If you don’t get Jackson Pollock, it's not that straightforward. Why was he the one who made it big in a crowded field? In 1951, Life Magazine published an article about all the big art stars in America. There are a lot of future museum staples in there, like Mark Rothko, de Kooning, and Clyfford Still. But Pollock? He’s in the middle. To understand why, you’ve got to return to the center of that other picture. In 1933, Clement Greenberg — friends called him Clem — was a necktie salesman. He became the most influential art critic of the 20th century. In a small New York art scene where artists and critics partied together, that made him an eye on a hidden world. It’s important to put into context how influential Greenberg was thanks to articles in the Partisan Review and the Nation. Let’s use Ferris Bueller as example. Millions of people know every scene of this movie, but not as many know that it’s a John Hughes movie. Now any movie fan knows John Hughes was the teen movie God. But many movie watchers just don’t. That’s a little like Clement Greenberg. He was enormously influential in the art world, but remains obscure to a wider audience. He broke through with the 1939 essay “Avant Garde and Kitsch,” in which he proposed that art was a bulwark against mass culture. He was a newbie to art - that Avant Garde and Kitsch essay referenced a painting that didn’t exist. Later, in a famous mistake, he said this painting had orange and purple in it. It doesn't. If you know that artist Piet Mondrian narrowed himself to primary colors, the blooper is even worse. Still, some painters respected him. Robert Motherwell said, “I disagreed with him about many things but he had a painter's eye. And none of the other critics did; not one. So as a direct intuition he got it right off the bat."" That eye advanced an aggressive vision of modern painting that said the buzz wasn’t in Paris, but New York. And the perfect American? The cowboy who happened to look a lot like Clement Greenberg. OK, that’s a little unfair. But seriously? This is like that meme: “You Vs. The Guy She Told You Not To Worry About.” And it’s true that Greenberg’s abrasive, American-centric, hypermasculine view of art worked better with Pollock than with a Dutch immigrant like de Kooning, who noodled over his paintings obsessively. In his essay “American Type Painting,” Greenberg wrote that Pollock was “alone in his power to assert a paint-strewn or paint-laden surface as a single synoptic image.” Pollock “pulverized” the canvas - when he changed his mind, he made “violent repentance.” Throughout the 1940s, Greenberg and Pollock rose together, while slightly less renowned critics popped up around them. Greenberg was the brain, Pollock was the soul. This cheerleading from 1947 was typical, in which Greenberg called Pollock “radically American,” and the most “Powerful painter in contemporary America.” That praise bubbled to the mainstream. That Life magazine article from 1948, the one that made Pollock as mainstream as the cheese platter ad on the next page? The entire basis for that article was a “formidably high-brow New York critic.” The New York art scene knew that Clement Greenberg. But the rest of the country saw the new star at the top of the page. Helen Frankenthaler didn’t drip paint like Jackson Pollock. She soaked and stained her canvases, resulting in haunting images like Mountains and Sea. This is her in the middle, with Jackson Pollock, Clement Greenberg, and Lee Krasner. Greenberg and Frankenthaler saw each other for about five years. Frankenthaler later said that her dating Greenberg was one of the reasons that he rarely wrote about her work. Greenberg helped make museum names out of Clyfford Still, and Barnett Newman, and Mark Rothko, but he missed many movements and artists. That had consequences. Frankenthaler is a legend, a mainstream name. But she’s famous the way Clement Greenberg is famous, not the way Jackson Pollock is. And she is kind of a symbol for all the artists whose careers Greenberg made — or overlooked. One critic shaped how we look at a half-century of painting. If Pollock was overrated, Clement Greenberg was the one doing it. We just followed his lead. So what is the correction here? It’s not to discount Jackson Pollock, it’s to give more attention to those other abstract expressionists as well. And to know the critic who decided which names we’d learn. With that in mind, maybe it’s possible to come up with more than just Jackson Pollock’s name. “Anyone? Anyone?” So, if you want to learn more about Clem, I really recommend Florence Rubenfeld’s book about him. It gives you an entire new angle on a half century of American art, and it features a surprising number of fist fights. "

When I plug my laptop charger into an outlet, that weird box between the plug and the part where it connects to my computer, it gets super hot, like I can’t even touch it. So, I’ve invited Audrey Quinn from NPR’s Planet Money team to help explain what’s going on with my super-hot laptop charger. So, Audrey, what’s the deal? QUINN: ""The first thing you have to understand is that the kind of power that comes out of your wall is actually different from the kind of power that your electronics want. It comes out in the form of alternating current electricity. That means the electrons are pulsing back and forth And your electronics want what’s called direct current power, that’s where the electrons are flowing straight like a river So, they have to convert it. And &nbsp;when they do that conversion is energy is wasted, so what you’re feeling is energy lost in the form of heat."" Okay, so, why can’t I just alternating current? If that’s coming out of the wall? QUINN: ""Yeah, that works just fine for things like lightbulbs or a hairdryer, but electronics are a little more complicated.---- If you were to send that alternating current directly to your laptop, you’d probably see a puff of blue smoke."" Oh god, that sounds bad. Okay, so, if DC power is so great, why don’t we just have it in our houses in the first place? &nbsp; This goes back to the late 1800s. There were two guys who represented the two different kinds of power. There was Thomas Edison, he was all about DC power, and then there’s Nikola Tesla, he’s your AC guy. They’re totally duking it out. Every time a new building goes in, it’s kind of this 'oh, what’s going to happen? Are they going to use AC or DC?' What happens eventually is that AC power is much better at traveling long distances. So, ultimately, the entire power grid gets set up to spread AC power."" But today we have all of these devices. We have smartphones, we have electric cars, we have tablets, we have computers, and all these things are hungry for DC power. Do you think we could ever switch back and maybe realize Edison’s original dream of DC power in every home? QUINN: ""The US has one of the best, most reliable power grids in the world, so people aren’t saying 'let’s knock out this entire grid.' You could just have one converter box in your house, and that way you’re not converting AC to DC at the level of every single device."" So, if we can reduce the number of conversions from AC power to DC power, even a little bit, we’re going to save a lot of energy. "
166,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,hLrFyjGZ9NU,"It's more expensive to live in Hong Kong than anywhere in the world. Hong Kong has been ranked the least affordable housing market in the world eight years in a row and by a long shot. Housing prices are now almost 20 times more than annual income. That means that a household making $50,000 USD would on average be looking for a house that cost $980,000 USD. And it's getting really bad. Hundreds of thousands of residents now squeeze into incredibly small apartments, most of them no bigger than a parking space. So these are cage homes, which basically fit one person and their belongings. And they basically stack these in a room in order to fit as many people as they can in the room. And yet the price per square foot for these smaller houses just keeps shooting up. I visited these homes to try to piece together an explanation for this trend and to meet the people who are being squeezed by the world's least affordable real estate market. There are now tens of thousands of people in this city who live in spaces that are between 75 and 140 square feet. For some perspective a typical parking space in the US is 120 square feet. One of the most common strategies for small space living is this subdivided house model. This big space that's been divided up into a bunch of tiny little living spaces. These people basically have room for a bed and a table and a few belongings. What makes this model work is that they have a bigger communal space where they're able to have their cooking and their washing and the bathroom open to everyone, so that they can save space and save money in their actual living quarters. So this is the kitchen for this space which is shared by four families. The tempting explanation here for why the prices are so high is land scarcity. You know, seven and a half million people crammed into this series of islands, it's gonna drive up the prices. The same story in a lot of places that have run out of land that are in high demand — in San Francisco or New York City. Okay this might be the story in New York City and San Francisco, but is Hong Kong actually running out of land? Let's see what the drone says about this. Flying over Hong Kong you start to see that, while yes, there's a very dense urban landscape, there's also a whole lot of green space. Government land-use data says that 75 percent of the land in Hong Kong is not developed. Now some of that is mountainous and rocky and not easy to build on, but certainly not all of it. So I posed this question about density to two experts, one is a Hong Kong citizen and the other is a 30-plus year resident. Both are advocates for better urban design. Are high prices primarily the result of land scarcity? No. There's a land-use issue, because also land is being inefficiently used or conserved. The problem isn't the shortage of land the problem is bad land management. Land use, land management, what these experts are referring to is that of all the land in Hong Kong only 3.7% is zoned for urban housing. But it's not because of mountains, it's because of policy and this gets to the heart of the explanation of why more and more people are living in homes the size of parking spaces. The first thing to note if you want to understand the real explanation, is that the government owns all of the land in Hong Kong. Well, all except for this one church that the British built here when they ruled it back in the 1800s and it kind of just escaped the whole government-owns-all-the-land thing. So the government owns all the land and it leases it out to developers, usually for 50 years in an auction process where the highest bidder gets the contract. With such scarce and valuable land zoned for housing, real estate companies more and more of them coming from mainland China with lots of money, will duke it out in these auctions. And will end up at an astronomically high price. Like this plot of land that was just leased out for 2.2 billion dollars, which set an all-time record for the most expensive land of ever leased by the Hong Kong government to a developer. So the way the government zones and leases land is the first part of this. The other part of this explanation has a lot to do with taxes. If you're the type of person who navigates away from this video when you hear the word tax policy, stay with me here. This place loves low taxes. It's a great place to do business, because the corporate tax is low no value-added tax, no sales tax, free market economics, low taxes. That's embedded into the fabric of this place. Look at all those low taxes doing their work, building up those skyscrapers, slapping on those bank logos all over town. So if the government isn't getting revenue from taxes, it really needs it from another source and in the case of Hong Kong that source is land sales. A lot of the government revenues here driven by land revenues and it's about 30% of government public financing income. The government of Hong Kong can lease out this land to developers at astronomical prices, make a ton of revenue from that and not have to raise taxes on the people or the corporations that reside here and they still proudly retain their ranking as the freest economy on earth. What this means is that the Hong Kong government doesn't have a huge incentive to free up more land and lower prices, but while this current arrangement of bidding and auctions is really good for revenue for the government and good for the market generally, it's not super good for the people of Hong Kong. Of all the small spaces, this is easily the most cramped. These are coffin homes. Could I ask you just a quick question about your living space? The government is slowly working on this problem. Year after year new policies come in that are meant to fix this, but they're slow to change, mainly because they have an incentive to keep the status quo as it is. Out here at this industrial complex in Hong Kong, I met with a guy named Eric Wong, a local inventor and businessman who has seen a business opportunity in the midst of this space crisis. Eric grew up in Hong Kong and has been thinking about small-space living for a long time. Oh it has WiFi. These capsules come in one or two-person sizes and are meant to provide a more efficient and hygienic version of the cage and coffin homes, all at a relatively low price. Down here there's a little box where you can put all your valuables and so there's mirror lights, there's reading lights. But these capsules, innovative as they are, really just put a band-aid on this housing problem. They don't serve as a real solution. A real solution would need to come from something that's much less profitable and fun to look at: Government policy and zoning reform that will free up more land and put the interests of the people above the interests of the market, but until the government can make that happen people in Hong Kong will continue to squeeze into smaller and smaller spaces.

Just look at this map. It's not just unhelpful, it's actually misleading. It shows the states that Mitt Romney and Barack Obama won in 2012.  Without more information it's really hard to tell that Obama actually won. He beat Romney by more than a hundred electoral votes. So, while this map does a great job telling you that Romney won Montana, for example, it doesn't tell you is how much that victory doesn't matter. That's because montana only gets three electoral votes. Massachusetts gets four times as many, and you can barely find it on the map. That's because the people who made this map made a choice. They chose to prioritize geographic accuracy over electoral importance. And geographically accurate maps are great for road trips, but they don't do a very good job telling account the country voted. So, some designers have tried other solutions. They're making different maps called cartograms. These maps distort the state's shape so that their physical size corresponds not with their geographic boundaries, but with the number of electoral votes they get. Here's a version designed by the New York Times, with each state scaled by electoral votes. They've ditched the precise borders of each state in favor of squares, but still arranged them geographically, so it's easy enough to find your own state. Another approach from the Daily Kos makes room to report the popular vote from each congressional district. But so far these ideas haven't been widely adopted. So does this mean that we're stuck with bad maps for another election cycle? Not necessarily. There are so many different ways to visualize information. Why not show a list of states? Or a series of bar charts? All of these methods tell you so much more than those ubiquitous red state, blue state maps. "

So we can see this first of all by just looking at a pretty basic political map of Ukraine. If you look at the result in the election that brought Yanukovych to power, you can see that the eastern regions of the country were far more likely to support Yanukovych, and the western regions were far more likely to support Tymochenko. And the interesting thing about that is the that political divide that you see comes up in a ton of different aspects of Ukrainian's history and geography. So one area is the linguistic divide. The divides the different regions of the country that are predominately Russian-speaking as opposed to predominantly Ukranian speaking really closely mirrored that political divide. Russia went through a series of policies to do what they called ""Russification"" in the 1700s under Catherine the Great, so this goes back hundreds and hundreds of years those policies involved everything from settling ethnic Russians in those regions to forbidding people from speaking the Ukrainian language. It continued well into the 20th century. Stalin essentially orchestrated this massive famine that killed millions of people in Ukraine. After that, they increase the resettlement of Russians into Ukraine. You were left with a Ukraine that looked different. Parts of the country were much more likely to speak Russian, be culturally Russian, be ethnically Russian, and it's had a lasting impact on the country as a whole. Fast-forward to modern Ukraine. When Yanukovych was elected, he was negotiating with the EU about a deal that would have brought closer EU ties. So then when he abandoned that and took a bailout from Russia instead, that was perceived as him really kinda turning away from the west and turning towards Russia. And that was very controversial. It prompted protests that were largely clustered in the western part of the country and the capital city Kiev. And eventually it forced Yanukovych out of office. Point is that this is not just Russia invading Ukraine The point is that there are Ukrainian separatists who are actively trying to achieved independence from Kiev. Different parts of ukraine have a very different idea what kind of country Ukraine should be. And that doesn't make it OK--that doesn't make it acceptable as the matter of international law. It certainly doesn't justify  what Russia has been doing, but it also shouldn't be something that you ignore. "
169,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,iMtXqTmfta0,"In 1989, Japan’s Shinkansen Bullet Train had a problem. It was fast — really fast — like, pushing 170 miles per hour fast. But every time it exited a tunnel — it was loud. The noise was coming from a variety of sources, but whenever a train sped into a tunnel, it pushed waves of atmospheric pressure through the other end. The air exited tunnels with a sonic boom that could be heard 400 meters away. In dense residential areas, that was a huge problem. So, an engineering team was brought in to design a quieter, faster, and more efficient train. And they had one secret weapon: Eiji Nakatsu — the general manager of the technical development department — was a birdwatcher. Different components of the redesigned bullet train were based on different birds. Owls inspired the pantograph — that’s the rig that connects the train to the electric wires above. Nakatsu modeled the redesign after their feathers, reducing noise by using the same serrations and curvature that allow them to silently swoop down to catch prey. The Adelie Penguin — whose smooth body allows it to swim and slide effortlessly — inspired the pantograph’s supporting shaft, redesigned for lower wind resistance. And perhaps most notable of all was the Kingfisher. The Kingfisher is a bird that dives into water to catch its prey. The unique shape of its beak allows it to do that while barely making a splash. Nakatsu took that shape to the design table. The team shot bullets shaped like different train nose models down a pipe to measure pressure waves, and dropped them in water to measure the splash size. The quietest nose design was the one modeled most closely after the Kingfisher’s beak. When the redesign debuted in 1997, it was 10% faster, used 15% less electricity, and stayed under the 70 dB noise limit in residential areas. And it did all that with the wings of an owl, the belly of a penguin, and the nose of a Kingfisher. There’s a name for design like this. It’s called biomimicry. The people who design our world usually never take a biology class, believe it or not. So they're novices in how the world works. That’s Janine Benyus. Back in 1997, she wrote the book that coined the term “Biomimicry”. It told the story of the innovations in computing, energy, and health that were inspired by structures in the natural world. Stick like a gecko. Compute like a cell. Even  run a business like a redwood forest. Benyus has since worked as a consultant for various companies, trying to get them to understand how to take design ideas from nature. That might mean studying prairie dog burrows to build better air ventilation systems, mimicking shark skin to create bacteria-resistant plastic surfaces for hospitals, or arranging wind turbines in the same drag-reducing pattern that schools of fish swim in. Designers get inspiration from a lot of different places, but Benyus thinks many of them could benefit from looking more at the natural world. So there's a lot of looking at what other people have done. And what they do is, they look at all the others, and they get ideas. They literally do, I mean, a lot of designers have lots of magazines that they look through, they tear those out and they put them up on inspiration boards. But they're looking at other human technologies. Her idea was simple: designers should get in the habit of bringing a biologist to the table, and let them help solve problems by mimicking nature. And there are three main ways they can do that. You can mimic its form, or its shape. You might create a paint for a building that, when it dries, it's got the same structure as self-cleaning leaves, lotus leaves are notoriously great, they let rainwater clean the leaf because because they have these bumps and the rain water balls up on the bumps, and then it pearls away the dirt. So that lotus effect is physical, and you can create a physical structure on the outside of any product. Imagine that on the outside your car, rainwater would clean your car. So that's mimicking form. But there's also mimicking process, the processes of the natural world. It might even be how you mimic how ants communicate in order to efficiently find sources of food or new places to live. And those processes, that self-organization, has been mimicked in software, in things like autonomous cars and how they're gonna move in flocks through the city by talking to one another. That's mimicking nature's process. And then you jump up to the level of mimicking whole ecosystems. There's a thing that's a buzzword right now, that's really hot, called the circular economy, which is essentially industries saying there should be no such thing as a byproduct in a manufacturing facility that goes to landfill. It should be used by something else, and at the end of a product's life, that product should be upcycled into something else. It's being called the circular economy. Ecosystems do that really, really, really well. You've got a log on the forest floor, and those materials move up into the body of the fungus that eats it. Those materials move up into a mouse. And that mouse material moves up into a hawk... And if you think about that as what we'd like to do with local materials being upcycled constantly. In our cities, for instance. Those ecosystem lessons are really big for us. And that’s the end goal for biomimetic design — making products, systems, and cities functionally indistinguishable from the natural world. Life has been around on Earth for 3.8 billion years — and what designers are starting to realize is that’s a lot of research and development time. The people who design our world have a lot to learn from the natural world. All they have to do is take a look. Thank you so much for watching, this is one of a series of videos that we're doing in collaboration with 99% Invisible. They are a podcast that does stories all about design. We loved working with them, you should definitely check them out at 99pi.org or on any podcast app. "
170,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,iWssRVJgPqc,"""Dude it was called @ Cafe — and they didn't know what the @ symbol was."" ""Welcome to @ Cafe, as in that little a with a circle around it."" ""I was actually bitter that I named it @ Cafe. I had to explain to everybody, every reporter, every human, every — even people who came to work there — I had to explain what the @ symbol was."" ""That little mark, with the A and then the ring around it."" ""At."" ""See, that's what I said. Katie said she thought it was about."" ""Yeah."" ""Oh."" ""But I'd never heard it said."" ""And they're like, 'I get it, at the cafe.' I was like, no, it's used in e-mail. 'What's email?'"" This is Glenn McGinnis in July 2016 and this is Glenn McGinnis in July 1995. In January of 1995, Glenn and his cofounders, Nick Barnes and Chris Townsend, opened one of New York's first internet cafes: @ Cafe. Their story isn't just about running a cafe, though it is definitely that. ""Um, you know it's fun to hang out, you can drink around your computer and not worry about it."" It's a window into how it felt to be around the internet just as a mass audience was discovering the exhilaration and exhaustion of a new medium. ""I'm terrified and excited."" And from the beginning, Glenn McGinnis knew one thing: ""How fast it was gonna hit. And that it was going to be completely pervasive."" In the 1880s, St. Marks Place was part of a German-American neighborhood called Kleindeutschland. 12 St Marks Place was home to the German American shooting society clubhouse. They came together to shoot, drink, and bowl. By the 1920s, it was a homeless shelter run by a guy who called himself Mr. Zero. He sheltered a thousand people who he affectionately called ""Old Bucks and Lame Ducks."" And after that, the building continued to house legendary tenants. ""We selected 12 St. Marks Place. It was the old St. Marks Bookstore. And that has a really storied history with all sorts of amazing authors reading their work there. And so to me it was very symbolic of internet, the new media, and you know, I wanted to be there. In that spot. It seemed so appropriate."" But convincing investors was harder. The idea was a really new one. ""I lived overseas a lot as a kid. I was always obsessed with video games. I played Pong and they could not pry me off it, and in 1980 we moved to Tokyo, and it was like the Japanese were my people. I mean, they just adored computers and video games."" ""In Asia, most of the video games were tabletop. So you'd sit — you could have coffee or whatever on the games — and they had coffeeshops with these tabletop games. I thought of the internet cafe probably because of the Tokyo experience with the tabletops."" Internet adoption was pretty low at the time. Six months after @ Cafe launched, just 14% of Americans were using the internet. How much more did the investors know? ""Zero! They didn't know what it was. They'd never been online. It was Netscape 1.0. They could only think of it in terms of Hard Rock. That was it. It will be the Hard Rock Cafe, but with computers rather than rock and roll."" ""I was determined to do this thing, so I was like, fine."" ""Well the @ Cafe, which is a cyber-bar down in New York City's East Village is where we went to visit."" The @ Cafe didn't have dial-up. Instead, they paid for a premium T1 connection — the type that universities and really large businesses had. It was much faster than dial-up modems, but that stability came at a hefty price. ""The T1 cost $9000 a month! I think my FIOS which is 75 megabits, synchronous, is $100. Maybe $200. It's amazing how in 20 years..."" The @ Cafe had a world class internet connection for the time, and they personally negotiated to get it. ""We basically, for Chris Townsend and myself, just created hell for ourselves. The pipes for the hot water and everything ran through the server room. We didn't know anything, we had no money to ask anybody. So there was no ventilation. And we had no money for air conditioning. So we made it a responsibility of the dishwasher to fill up a garbage can — I mean a giant garbage can — with ice from the ice maker, and drag it into the server room. And that thing would melt to water every two hours. And that's how we cooled the server room, was with a friggin' thing of ice."" The excitement came from the idea itself, that people would want to go on the internet for fun, to connect. ""If you go back and look, anybody can go into the Internet Archive and look at what the websites looked like back then. I mean, it's freaking hysterical. I mean, there was not a lot out there. And these pages were text — they weren't high bandwidth pages."" Despite the headaches, it still felt like the start of something. ""Everyone is like waking up to the internet. I mean, you have to understand, no business had a website. Very idealistic and then the corporations started to hit and that's when they just came knocking at the door and it was like they all wanted to do web launches because there was nowhere they could all put their homepage up on all the computers."" And a bevy of new websites had launch parties at the @ Cafe. ""I was working non-stop."" They did events, they ran an ISP, and they continued to serve the weird culture of a still-bohemian St. Marks. Artists like Mark Yankus even made ads for them. ""Everyone, college students, artists, East Village freaks, Phiber Optik and his whole crew, when he got out of jail, he made that his hangout spot, he was there all the time."" ""That's Phiber Optik with a PH."" ""Today, five hackers were indicted on Federal wire fraud charges."" ""When we changed the menu he got bummed, and we saw less of him."" ""A lot of hackers were there. A lot of artists, a lot of students, it was an amazing mix of people. The media was all over it, and so people were coming from Japan specifically to see the cafe."" But despite all that, a little over a year later, in 1996, @ Cafe closed down. ""It was horrible from the beginning. We never ever broke even, it was the most stressful thing...it was very stressful."" It'd be simpler to say that people retreated from internet cafes to use the internet at home, and there were a lot of AOL CDs offering people free trials. ""We had hundreds of AOL CDs at the cafe. I mean just the amount of CDs was just ludicrous."" But the cafe closed for a lot of reasons. It was tough to make money with a T1 connection, but it was also just tough to run a restaurant in general. The internet wasn't the problem, the business was before its time. ""It was so idealistic, what we were doing. It was just to educate, and the internet would never be monetized."" ""The idea was really to create a physical space to present virtual space, to extend the invitation to the public and say, 'Here is the internet at its best.'"" Today, 12 St. Marks Place is not a German shooting gallery, or a homeless shelter, or a bookshop, or an internet cafe. It's apartments, a yoga studio, and a Latin organic vegan restaurant. There's no shooting gallery, bowling alley, bookshop, or old bucks and lame ducks. But they do have one thing. ""So I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the business there, just to check my information. Do you have internet there?"" ""Yes."" ""Do you know how fast it is?"" ""I don't know how fast it is. I know it's fast enough, all of our guests use it fine."" Glenn told me that video chat was actually really popular in the early days of the cafe, but the quality left something to be desired. This is what most video chats would have looked like using the CUCMe software that was popular at the time. "
171,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,j4ahNpQLgdk,"This is the moment Estelle and I began to question our sanity. There's definitely a promising cave down there. I don't know if it's a bear den or a mountain lion den. We’re right about here just outside of Yellowstone National Park. And we’re looking for a tiny box about the size of a happy meal that’s filled with over a million dollars worth of treasure. We’re here because of a guy named Forrest Fenn. You might have heard of him. Well you've likely heard of that Santa Fe author Forrest Fenn. Forrest Fenn On to this a Santa Fe art collector and author, Forrest Fenn. Fenn is one of those rare characters he's like straight out of a wild west film. He served as a pilot in the Air Force, took up a hobby as an amatuer archeologist, then later moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico and opened an Art Gallery. Over the years, he amassed a collection of artifacts worthy of the finest museums. He made a fortune selling his wares to US Presidents and Hollywood tycoons. In 1988, Fenn was diagnosed with cancer. He fought it off — but it got him thinking about his legacy. When faced with his own mortality, he decided to do what any eccentric man might do to ensure his spirit lived on after death. He buried a treasure chest. Some time between 2009 and 2010, Forrest claims that he trekked out into the Rocky Mountains and hid a 12th century bronze chest containing 42 pounds of his finest treasures — gold nuggets the size of chicken eggs, 16th-century Spanish jewelry, and even a ming dynasty jade sculpture. In 2010, Fenn self-published The Thrill of the Chase, the memoir And in the back of the book there’s a poem. That poem contains 9 clues that supposedly lead to the treasure’s exact location. It goes a little something like this. As I have gone alone in there And with my treasures bold, I can keep my secret where, And hint of riches new and old. Begin it where warm waters halt And take it in the canyon down, Not far, but too far to walk. Put in below the home of Brown. From there it’s no place for the meek, The end is ever drawing nigh; There’ll be no paddle up your creek, Just heavy loads and water high. If you’ve been wise and found the blaze, Look quickly down, your quest to cease, But tarry scant with marvel gaze, Just take the chest and go in peace. So why is it that I must go And leave my trove for all to seek? The answers I already know, I’ve done it tired, and now I’m weak. So hear me all and listen good, Your effort will be worth the cold. If you are brave and in the wood I give you title to the gold. Ten years later, nobody’s found it — and many have tried. But Forrest, who’s now a cult-like figure in the treasure hunting world, has admitted that four of the nine clues have been solved. And apparently, some people have gotten within 250 feet of the gold. Update this morning on a story we have been telling you about for years a man who decided to give away his fortune claimed to have buried it somewhere out west several years ago. The treasure is real. The treasure story is real. The treasure is hidden where I left it and the search goes on. In public and private Facebook groups, more than 8,000 members rage in these deep philosophical debates over the interpretation of the clues. The “FindingFennsGold” sub-Reddit boasts 1,600 regular contributors, who pose questions like “What kind of hill can an 80 year-old man climb?” and “Does anyone else here have dreams about the treasure?” Over the past year, we talked to a lot of these treasure hunters. Like Ricky and Greg. You can see big red behind me. We’re here in historic Natchez, Mississippi today. They’re engineers on a steamboat. So this is a daily search for you? Every night. Every night I'm looking. If you ask anybody that works with us on the boat they will tell you that Greg, oh yeah, he's the one looking for Forrest Fenn's treasure. No I'm not this type of person at all. I do crossword puzzles I don't like camping it was the extreme opposite of anything I've ever done. So how did you first hear about Fenn's treasure. Well I've never heard of it before until this. There it is. Treasure hunter dies in search of writers $2 million gold. In the morning I get this newspaper delivered and by about 2 o'clock in the afternoon i think I've solved it. I studied geography in college so I'm all into maps. I spent hours upon hours just looking through google maps at all the places he went. It's really easy to become obsessed with this story. This is Josh and his Dad, they spent a week traversing New Mexico for a family vacation. Just looking for the chest. I’d say about 8 weeks of really hard research, google maps, little sleep, too excited to sleep type of stuff A lot of too excited to sleep for me. And that obsession? It happened to us too. I asked Zack if he wanted to help me find the treasure. I said “absolutely yes.” So we went to the Rocky Mountains with a foolproof plan to find Forrest Fenn’s gold. [Cow moo] Come on buddy, please move. We are definitely in Wyoming. [Phone rings] Hi it's Scott Hey Scott? It's Zack. So you're wondering Montana looking for treasure? Actually we're on the road right now we just came from Bozeman and we're driving down toward Wyoming. We're pretty convinced the treasure's there. Wyoming? Okay. Well Wyoming is the right state, no question. Oh yeah? Really? Absolutely. Have you been to your spot yet? I have. I made a mistake. You probably heard this story from multiple people as well. It's what keeps me awake at night at the moment. But if you were to go back you know what the mistake was? Absolutely. You're scaring me I feel like we're going to come back from this trip and just not sleep for weeks. Is this your first time that you’ve been out searching? You’ll be out there and you’ll find what everybody else finds. Your reaction will be “wow we could spend the next 10 years right here right where we are and never stumble across a 10x10x6 chest. Dude I’m shocked he just said it’s in Wyoming like I expected him to be really adamant it’s in colorado - yeah and I feel pretty good right now that this established esteemed treasure hunter thinks that it's uh in the same general at least the same state where we're going. At least we’re in the right state, Estelle. There's a weird unspoken dynamic with Fenn treasure hunters. We're a community and we're all collectively scratching our heads trying to decipher what Forrest Fenn is telling us. But we don't want to give away too much after all we want to be the first ones to find that treasure. In our research, we came across this map made the amatuer cartographers. Using geographic data from the clues they were able to narrow down the original search area from 27 million acres to 591,636 acres. That’s a 98% reduction in size. Even just in that area, we’re looking at 23,310 acres of wild land. We now think it's probably more towards Yellowstone. Where specifically did you go in Yellowstone? I can't give you too many clues! I haven't found the treasure yet. If I got it, it's more about being know as the person that found it. That's all I want. Zack and I each spent week coming up with our own theories. Zack spent an entire afternoon trying to convince me that the longitude and latitude markers on Fenn's map were a clue. Obviously that was crazy. He actually owns Sitting Bull's original peace pipe. What? It's worth $1.1 million dollars. That checks out. All the old men look like Forrest Fenn out here. Every elderly gentleman I drive by I just the first my first though is - I'm like it's Forrest! Yeah. What does that say about how obsessed we are. We reached out to Fenn early on in our research with the same starry eyes that many treasure hunters do. He denied our request to interview him. Yeah I wonder how many people he emails and he's just like god damn why do I have to answer another one of these emails. Maybe it's because he knew we were getting close to the treasure. And with that, here is where I think the treasure is. So first you start with ""Where warm waters halt."" That's the Firehole River Falls right in the heart of Yellowstone National park. Now the name of the river speaks for itself. Oh okay. There's the cave. There it is. Oh man, that is not what I expected. Actually in 2007 water temperatures in the falls rose to 82 degrees and it killed a bunch of trout there, pretty much halting life. So coincidentally right above the falls there's this canyon and it leads to the Madison River. Now if you take the Madison River straight to Hebgen Lake that's ""too far to walk."" So at this point we're right on the border of Montana and Wyoming but it's a place Fenn explored as a kid so that counts for something. Now above Hebgen Lake is grizzly bear territory ""Home of Brown"" and Red canyon creek ""No paddle up your creek"" So in 1959 a massive earthquake shook this region and the Hebgen Lake dam gave way creating Quake lake along with a deadly landslide. That's heavy loads and water high. But Estelle, what's the blaze? Honestly it could be anything. A lot of people think you'll only be able to see it if you're standing in the exact right spot. So all of that sounds really good to me but the skeptic in me says ""hold on Estelle"" this is a highly interpretive poem thousands of people have come up with hundreds and hundreds of different theories that seem to fit perfectly like puzzle pieces. Are you going to tell me that I'm wrong right now? I will not crush you in this moment. Forrest himself has acknowledged that this treasure may very well be around for 10,000 years before someone finds it. At least one person has been within 200 feet of the treasure and if that has happened - someone was standing 200 feet away from millions of dollars! Yeah if that happened with six years of it being hidden then how could it possibly last 1,000 years. radio: make the bears aware of your presence and carry bear spray. Bear spray has been shown to be over 90% effective in deterring bear attacks. So we realized very quickly that despite these cute pictures of bears in yellowstone they are very dangerous and we could very easily get mauled by one today if we're not careful. So apparently this thing has 7 seconds of spray in it. That's about enough to ward off one grizzly bear. Hopefully we won't need to use it today. Fenn's treasure has lured many unprepared hunters into the wilderness. We talked with a park ranger actually who said people had ventured into snow impacted mountain ranges with just tennis shoes. This morning we're waiting on the office of the medical investigator find out how a hiker searching for Forrest Fenn's treasure died. In January 2016 Randy Bilyeu went missing in search of the treasure six months later he was found dead. Somewhere in this area which is a huge area of land is the treasure. And it's just a matter of figuring out that exact spot. We're a mile pass the trailhead and I think we found something. It's a tiny little cave that you could easily miss. Zack has now decided to climb up the entire face of this cliff and try to get into a cave that's about a couple hundred feet high. There was a time when I thought the Fenn treasure could be in a cave because one thing he said was that it's in a spot that you could come back to in 10,000 years and it might hypothetically still be there. A cave protects things from the elements so I thought maybe that was a possibility Definitely not in that cave though. We're wondering Wyoming constantly asking ourselves. What would Fenn do? Where would an adventurous fly fisherman who loves history artifacts and practical jokes hide a treasure chest? Do you think Fenn's going to watch this and think we're a bunch of idiots? I think Fenn is the kind of guy that thinks a lot of people are idiots so Look I just don't want him to think I'm an idiot. I'd like to make a film that gains his respect a little bit. Like I would like to think that Fenn is sitting somewhere tipping his cowboy hat to us. It's really clear from every treasure hunter we talked to that once you have a potential solve it's really hard to entertain any other theory, even if it makes total sense. Here it is six years later and I found the spot. At the first opportunity he gets to go back out there I think he'll find it. That's the beauty of it everyone knows where it is one of us has got to be right. You could completely solve the poem and be on totally the right trail and you still might miss the treasure. There are some theories that this is all about poop. Heavy loads. Oh my god. There's like - Home of Brown, heavy loads No paddle up your creek I think that just proves how interpretive this is. You could literally take every clue in that poem and make it about a piece of crap. So where are we going? So today we are heading back into the heart of Yellowstone park which is apparently the oldest park in the United States. Actually last night I did a little sleuthing and found out that Forrest is a board member at Buffalo Bill center. Some hunters seem to think that Fenn hid the treasure while up here on a trip for a board members meeting and he just took off one morning, hid the treasure and came back for his black bow tie event in September of 2009. That theory would definitely correspond with the Lamar Valley area and also with Fenn's fascination of the Native American history that this valley holds. We are going to drive all the way down highway 212 to a place called Icebox Canyon. In this canyon there's a creek called Soda Butte creek. Soda Butte is this extinct geyser in the middle of the Valley. Soda Butte. It's also along highway 212. 212 being the temperature at which water boils. And it's right near Icebox Canyon. There's no way this isn't the place ""where warm waters halt."" A bear completely mauled this area we're standing in right now uh all the trees around us are just completely scratched up. That's insane. Okay so that's just one clue Zack, where do we go from there? The Lamar Ranger station. Now every hunter has a line from the poem they obsess over And the line that seems to get the most people's attention is ""put in below the home of Brown."" Everybody focuses on the home of Brown. Everybody. Any searcher you speak to they're going to say ""if we can find the home of Brown we can find the treasure."" Like a lot of the poem, it’s pointing to a specific location. Have you talked to any treasure hunters what’s the take on that Brown? Give me some insights. Looking at a map, there are literally hundreds of locations it could refer to. You've got all of America looking for house of Brown One of the things that led us to the brown one is that the B is capitalized in “Brown.” If you Google the Lamar Ranger Station it’s clearly a hot spot for Fenn’s treasure hunters. It’s this old ranch in the historic district of the park. And back in the day, there was a really well-known ranger there named Gary Brown. Home of Brown. Well this is the home of Brown. Looks like the main facilities are closed down and uh it's not open to the public besides that I guess. Maybe they shut it down because so many treasure hunters came through asking. If it's not clear on our faces our confidence is completely shot right now. Every treasure hunter will tell you this you start a hike with rose colored glasses and by the end you realize that your task was nearly impossible. You're trying to find a 10x10x6 inch chest in 3,000 square miles of land if we're completely wrong about Yellowstone that's 300,000 square miles of land. We started all the way up here at icebox canyon followed down soda butte creek all the way down to the lamar ranger station which is our home of brown and then from there all we know is it's somewhere below the home of Brown. It could be on anyone of these trails or ridges or rivers or creeks. You should just point to random spot on the map be like let's just go there. Alright. Fossil forrest. That would be 10 miles of walking for forrest fenn and about 1200 to 1600 feet of elevation gain. I'm sure forrest is an absolute beast on the trails but how much does an 80 year old man do? I came to this with a limited amount of optimism and I think most of that optimism is now gone. Fenn says that his poem specifically leads to a very very concrete spot and I just don't see it. The clues are so vague and interpretive that I just can't possibly imagine them culminating on an exact spot on a map. We really have become crazy about this - yeah. I feel like this journey has changed me. Where are we going? I don't know. After coming back and maybe going into this convinced that you knew where the treasure was like a lot of other hunters and then coming back and realizing it wasn't there, did it change your mind at all about maybe that there is no treasure? There was a time frame when we started to wonder if it was real. He's gone through far too much trouble for it to be a hoax. Why would he do it? This is his legacy to the world. I think it's a great legacy. And I think he'll be happy if someone finds it in his lifetime. One thing about Forrest is that he's genuine about hiding this treasure. So if anybody that has that type of ability to get that type of stuff has no issue in my opinion putting together a box of the stuff he said he had. It's certainly plausible that he'd be able to do such a thing and i think he's eccentric enough that he would. I feel like we're just taking random guesses at this point you know? I think really we're lost after the first three or four clues. He probably put it in some secret Forrest Fenn cave somewhere. Uh there's a huge herd of deer or something crossing the street up there. Let's go check it out. What are they? Those look like mountain goats. Those are mountain goats. Holy crap. Okay. Let's pause for a second. We thought for sure those were cute little mountain goats but in our excitement we failed to realize that these were big horned sheep. Nonetheless we lost our minds. Oh look at the rainbow in the background. Oh dude are you kidding me? That's insane. The treasure at the end of the rainbow. Unbelievable. The whole entire trip left a lasting impression on me. Take on this poem. I don't even know the right word for it. It's just a very cryptic poem, but it's a fun poem. I'm starting to think about why Fenn planned this and why he did it and I'm starting to think that the treasure itself isn't so important. As hokey as that sounds. It's pretty hokey It is pretty hokey. His story about surviving a terminal kidney cancer diagnosis really helped me with my own health struggles and just being able to go out there and follow in his footsteps too. I'm so proud to be able to go out and do it. Is this sort of like a moment in your past or do you think you're going to continually think about it all the time. Oh no, oh my god no. The best is yet to come. Let me put it to you this way, in the end everyone is going to be left with a smile on their face. You're as ambiguous as Forrest is. We went down dozens of trails over the past five days and we came up completely empty. We didn't find the treasure. We probably didn't even come close. But maybe we did and we'll just never know. "
172,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,j7F7Pil9tVQ,"Mhmm...! Okay. So, there’s this question that I’ve been asking myself a lot lately. I’m constantly distracted... Wait...wait...wait. Umm... I wasn't listening. My room is a mess. I cleaned this yesterday. And I keep forgetting my keys everywhere. Do I have ADHD? And it seems like a lot of people on the internet are asking the exact same question. But the thing is... diagnosis can be a bit tricky. And the ADHD community is divided into two sides: People who think ADHD is being overdiagnosed, and people that think it’s being underdiagnosed. A key criteria for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is that, it shows up at a very early period of life. And that's according to the DSM, a manual published by the American Psychiatric Association. It’s essentially a huge guide with standardized criteria that doctors use to diagnose mental disorders. And according to the latest edition, there are 5 big things that need to be checked off to determine if someone has ADHD. First, you need to show persistent patterns of at least 6 symptoms from at least one of two categories. And these symptoms had to exist before the age of 12. Be present in two or more different settings. Interfere with your social, academic, or professional abilities. And not be “better explained by another mental disorder”. If you do meet these criteria, the good news is that ADHD medications are super effective. You might be familiar with Ritalin. It was introduced in back in 1955, and since then more pharmaceutical companies developed new types of ADHD medication. Today, about 75% of ADHD patients respond to 1 of 2 types of stimulants. Methylphenidate — &nbsp;which is in brands like Ritalin and Concerta — and Amphetamine, which is found in Adderall. But not everyone thinks this boom in drugs is a positive thing. This is Dr. Allen Frances, and he believes that ADHD is being overdiagnosed. According to a number of studies done in the US, Taiwan, Iceland, and Canada — the youngest kid in the classroom was way more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than the oldest kid. In 2013, the DSM’s criteria broadened to include children who had symptoms by age 12. Where previously, it required symptoms before the age 7. This looser criteria could possibly increase the risk of more children being misdiagnosed for ADHD and put on drugs. And all drugs have side effects — even the effective ones. Studies have found that ADHD medications increase heart rate and blood pressure. Other side effects include strokes, depression, and addiction. In rare cases, misdiagnosis can mean treating the wrong problem altogether. On the other hand... This is Dr. David Goodman and he thinks ADHD is being underdiagnosed. And this is a big problem, especially for women. Women are generally harder to diagnose because while hyperactivity is more common in men and boys, inattentiveness is more common for women and girls. Boys are twice as likely to be diagnosed with ADHD as girls are. But many argue that it’s not necessarily because it’s more common in boys. According to psychologist Ellen Littman, studies of ADHD were based mostly on hyperactive young boys, — leading to a distorted understanding of the disorder. Dr. Goodman also argues that media portrayals of ADHD can add to a stigma that keeps people from seeking treatment. “Hi there! What’s your name? My name is Abernathy Darwin Dunlap, but you can call me ADD… on the count of the fact that I have ADD.” “Wow. You were just the worst student in the world, weren’t you?” “They said I have AD… something. Can we have class outside?!” An extensive study has shown that ADHD patients who get treatment have much more beneficial academic and social outcomes in the long run than those who don’t. So the real problem here isn’t really whether there are too many or too few people diagnosed with ADHD. It’s... are the right people, getting the right treatment. And that’s something you’re not going to find on the internet. "
173,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,jOgPk5T1xi0,"This is one of my favorite hip hop records. It’s Ghostface Killah’s Ironman released in 1996. Listen to “Fish”, the 9th track on the record My triple sevens broke the slot machines out in Queens Grey Poupon is revlon rap, smack pawns, swing like batons Yes, this archetypal Ghostface verse is cryptic, stream-of-consciousness, and in your face. But...it also gave me a sense of de ja vu. That’s because 4 tracks before you’ll hear this verse from Raekwon First of all before we move on, this shit is like a Yukon, don Spread it out like Grey Poupon Wu-Tang must just love Grey Poupon, It makes sense -- they rap about food a lot. But as I was working on a video about Kanye West, I heard him too rap this on his 2016 song “Facts” Yeezy yeezy this is pure luxury I give em Grey Poupon on a DJ Mustard That’s fully 20 years later. I listen to hip hop all day long so I started logging anytime I heard Grey Poupon referenced in rap lyrics. It turns out Grey Poupon is everywhere. Why is this little jar of fancy mustard so ubiquitous in rap music? Well it starts here. The finer things in life. Happily some are affordable. Like Grey Poupon Dijon mustard. These ads started in 1981 and immediately they were a hit. When the first ad was tested in Seattle, the brand reportedly saw a 100% jump in sales. They tested it again in in New England and the same jump in sales happened, proving it wasn’t a fluke. Previously, the brand had only ever used print advertising, to appeal to an upper class audience. But mustard was the condiment of the 80s, and Grey Poupon wanted a piece of the pie even at a higher price point. A jar of Grey Poupon was nearly double the price of French’s or Guldens. So in 1981 this ad aired, telling consumers across the US that Grey Poupon was gourmet AND affordable while the phrase Pardon me, would you have any Grey Poupon? Inserted itself into the American lexicon. Over the next 10 years the campaign emphasized the mustard’s affordability while traveling on trains, planes, and yachts. This brings us to the early 90s when Nabisco wanted to change up the campaign. Usually you like the opp to create something new. But it’s pretty memorable why change it? We should just figure out how to make it more approachable. That’s Lee Garfinkle. He worked for the agency that made the ads. We came back with the idea of the guys poking fun of each other. Is this about the mustard again? Yes. Would you have some? Oh since you're offering yes I would. They added a squeeze bottle to emphasize that Grey Poupon was a fancy mustard you could use every single day. Sales took off again. That same year Das EFX, the influential east coast hip hop duo, began recording their debut album Dead Serious. Das EFX are the ones who crammed multiple syllables in a bar by adding “igity” at the end of words. Wiggity-wait a minute, giggity-guess who, well it's, umm, me The bumble B boogity woogity book the loopy Double O-K-iggity S When Dead Serious was released in 1992 it went platinum and the single “They Want EFX” quickly reached the Top 10 on the Billboard Charts. But it’s the song “East Coast” that marked what is probably the first recorded Grey Poupon reference in Hip Hop history. He's the Don, have you seen my grey poupon? Bust this, we roll more spliffs than Cheech and Chong Within that same month Wayne’s World premiered. Pardon me, do you have any Grey Poupon? By the spring of 1992 this glass jar of bougie white wine mustard spread itself across the pop culture landscape and started one of the weirdest trends in hip hop. [Boots as waiter] Fuck naw I ain't got no Grey Poupon [Rich female guest] Well anyway, I said, 'That's no burglar! That's my butler.' Mr. Rockefeller, let me in on the gossip I heard you and Mr. Getty are getting into rap music or something] This chart shows the rise of Grey Poupon in recorded music from 1992 to 2016 and it reveals something interesting about how words are used in hip hop culture. This particular brand of Dijon mustard has been like referenced a lot in rap music. I've used it a bunch. It comes up in freestyles all the time. That’s rapper Mike Eagle. I think in this particular case there's a couple of reasons for it. In one aspect I think it’s how convenient of a rhyme it is. You have a word like poupon and it rhymes with words like futon, neutron, and cupon. 26, and I done lived a lifetime a few times. From futons to Grey Poupons In church tryna get a little savings; yeah, a coupon. I spit that A1 everyday I'm hitting new primes. Out of the 118 songs mentioning the mustard, the most common rhyming word is coupon with 20. Followed by futon and crouton. I got the Grey Poupon, you been warned / Cause all beef return well done filet mignon / The Don, smell of Dom on my breath as I Yawn, (slow) Not only is Grey Poupon a good rhyming word. It also represents something. Hip Hop has always had this obsession with status symbols. If you have money you have grey poupon you don’t have french’s mustard. I think it’s just a very effective commercial in that way. Most of the songs mentioning Grey Poupon over the last 24 years have used it as a symbol of class. Half of them were used to brag and half were used as a juxtaposition to how poor they were. But I want to be in that limo askin' for the Grey Poupon, for a change / I'm sick of saving change from a coupon Others have used the Dijon mustard to signifying how exquisite their rapping skills are. Yeah, you're like a half-off coupon Me, I'm like a fresh jar of Grey Poupon Give me the mic quick, I need something to poop on And the rest, well Grey Poupon sells sex. Get you in the mood throw them slow grooves on / Spread you on a futon like Grey Poupon Have you been able to find a 2007 event that made it spike? I think I did, Mike. By 2007 the commercials hadn’t been on the air for a full decade. So why was it that from 2007 on there's just a huge jump in the number of references? Well, the majority of Grey Poupon songs in 2006-2007 were on albums that debuted at #1, had hit singles, and got a lot of radio airplay. For instance Jim Jones’ says Grey Poupon in his hit song “We Fly High.” Talk a buck 80 If the bentley is the topic (That grey poupon) But of course gotta fly ...? (Where?) The track took off in late 2006 when the New York Giants’ Michael Strahan started celebrating sacks to the song with a Jump Shot, a reference to the song. By 2007 kids in dance clubs across the country were jumpshotting everytime “Ballin” was sung. It was the 28th most popular song by the year’s end. “2 Step” by Unk had an accompanying dance called the “2 Step” and it features a Jim Jones verse that references Grey Poupon again. I get bread like croutons (dough), I make dough like crouissants (bread) I'm Grey Poupon (yep), Bentley shit baby (baby) The same year produced “Show it to me” by T.I. with a Nelly verse. That album debuted at #1. Country niggas in the chevy passin' Grey Poupon and “Boom” off of what is probably Lil Wayne’s greatest mixtape, Da Drought 3. I got more clips then any movie you've saw / I pull up on ya like I need some Grey Poupon Did I mention “Southside” the Kanye West Common collab? Look at that neutron on his green like croutons People asking him, ""do you have any grey poupon"" It was nominated for a Grammy for best rap album that year. From 2007 to 2016 TK% of the grey poupon songs ranked on the billboard charts or were on albums that did. The commercial itself probably had little to do with the recent rise of Grey Poupon in lyrics. It seems that the more Grey Poupon was in people’s ears, the more it was rapped by other artists in subsequent years. Nothing proves this more than the song Straatmeermin by the Dutch rap group, De Jeugd van Tegenwoordig. It’s entirely in Dutch except for this line. Money uit de let's get it on Geen pindakaas maar alleen Grey Poupon En dan nodigde ze me uit in haar con I reached out to Kraft Heinz, who now owns the Grey Poupon brand to see if the Dijon mustard is even sold in the Netherlands. I got this. No Estelle. It's not. Did you ever notice that a lot of rappers use the word? Being the kinda rapper I am I've always paid attention to words. When I looked at your list I was just dumbfounded that it was used that many times. Looking at that list it almost has to be subconscious. I think if anybody was aware that it was used that many times they wouldn't still use it. Nothing is quite as ubiquitous as that. "
174,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,jlPwTMMhGGI,"When people envision a future in art most often it's seen through a white lens. Only 8% of the 100 top grossing sci-fi and fantasy films featured a protagonist of color. Half the time the protagonist was Will Smith. The future looks different, if you look at it through the lens of black experiences. But we’re not all white or Will Smith. The future looks different, if you look at it through the lens of black experiences. That’s why we have this thing called Afrofuturism. The term was coined by culture critic Mark Dery in 1994 to point out the lack of black writers and black stories in science fiction. But this kind of art existed long before the term Afrofuturism did. Just look at music. Jazz musician Sun-Ra is probably one of the most recognizable Afrofuturists. He lays out an afrofuturistic design is his 1973 album Space is the Place, which you’re listening to now, and also became a film. The key is that his future was afrocentric – linking his futuristic self, to ancient forbears in Egypt. These ideas were more politically direct, and a lot more funky, in George Clinton’s Parliament during 1975. In “Mothership Connection” he connects the struggle of civil rights and “We Shall Overcome” to a positive future with evidence the struggle will work: ""You have overcome. For I am here"" He not only references an old song from the underground railroad to escape slavery: ""Swing down, sweet chariot. Stop and let me ride."" But he flipped a desperate history into positive futuristic ride on his spaceship as evidence the struggle is over and we’ve won ""Swing down, sweet chariot. Stop and let me ride"" — so of course everybody wants to get on. [Dr. Dre's ""Let Me Ride"" playing] And people did get on, [Dr. Dre's ""Let Me Ride"" continues] or at least some 90s hip hop heavyweights did. But Afrofuturism also critiques the way the future looks today like André 3000 did on his ATLiens verse. “Because the future of the world depends on"" ""If or if not the child we raise gon' have that n***a syndrome."" ""Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone.” He wants his unborn kid to get the future they want, not the one society created for them because of race. And that’s why he takes pride in the difference. They alienate us cause we different keep your hands to the sky. Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie. And empowers black people to fight to get what’s ours. ""I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie."" 'Cause that’s the thing about afrofuturism — it’s rooted in black people a better future for ourselves on our terms, like Janelle Monáe does in ""Q.U.E.E.N."" ""Even if it makes others uncomfortable"" ""I will love who I am."" This is the common thread of Afrofuturism. To overcome the current ways society remains unequal There needs to be futures where those problems are solved. Afrofuturism shows us what that looks like. It looks like hope. [Crowd shouting ""We goin' be alright."" ""Will you be electric sheep? Electric ladies, will you sleep? Or will you preach?"" "
175,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,k1vE_LVBx4s,"The United States has a problem with income inequality. People have different ideas about  why this is happening. CEO pay climbs every single year without exception. The United States has lost 5 million manufacturing jobs since the year 2000. big shifts that's happened in the economy that is lead in part to a decline in union membership. But one if the biggest drivers of inequality is hiding here, in these 2,000 pages. It's the US tax code. President Trump and Republicans in Congress have a plan to alter that code. and if they get their way it'll get even better for the richest Americans. First let's look at a few things that Trump and the Republicans don't want to change about the tax code. the charitable deduction and the mortgage interest deduction. Here's how they favor the rich: Let's say Dan makes $100 donation to his church.  He makes about $30,000 a year. Roughly, the median income for individuals in the US. Which puts him in the 15% tax bracket. It means he would save at most $15 on his taxes. But let's say Dan's boss Steve makes the same donation to his church. Steve makes $500,000 a year which puts him in the top tax bracket. And the same $100 donation could save Steve $39.60 on his taxes. Dan and Steve give the same amount to their church but Steve saves more than twice as much. Small examples like this add up. People making $100,000 or more account for about 57% of all the charitable contributions in the US but they get 76% of the tax benefits. This deduction is also really expensive. The US spends $70,000,000,000 a year on it. More than eight times what it spends on Head Start the federally funded preschool program and more than twice what it spends on Pell grants for low-income students to go to college. Plus there's all kinds of ways to bend the rules. Billionaire Mitchell Rales gets tax break for donating his collection of modern art to a museum that he built right next door to his house. A museum that's only open for private tours. But the worst thing about about the charitable deduction? There's not great evidence that it works. Turns out you don't need a tax break to encourage people to be generous to others. In the 1980's the top tax rate for the richest people was 70% and through a series of reforms it dropped to 28% and the Council on Foundations, it's kind of a trade group for charities, said, 'Oh my God, you do that we're going to lose all our contributions.' Guess what? No difference. People gave just as much with a much lower tax rate. Austria, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and New Zealand have all gotten rid of their deductions for charitable contributions and that hasn't had an impact on donation rates. One easy way to make things more fair? Replace the tax deduction with a tax credit. If Dan and Steve both give $100 to their church, give them each a $15 tax credit. That's how they do it in Canada. A tax credit reduces the amount you owe, so the same donation gets the same benefit no matter how rich you are. There's another tax deduction that's a boon for the wealthy. The mortgage interest deduction costs about $100,000,000,000 a year to the Treasury. We could use that money to treat wounded veterans, to build hospitals, to build highways but instead we give it to rich homeowners. Here's how it works: Let's say Dan buys a house for $100,000. He doesn't pay for that all at once. Each month he writes a check to the bank for $1,000. Let's say $800 goes to paying for the house, and the bank keeps $200. That's interest! Dan writes twelve of these checks a year, so he pays $2,400 a year in interest. The mortgage interest deduction let's Dan subtract that interest from his taxable income which could save him as much as $362. ""Nice,"" thinks Dan, that is until he hears about Steve. Steve also buys a house for $100,000. He also writes a $1,000 check each month paying $200 in interest. So after a year, Steve can also deduct the $2,400 from his taxable income. But that same deduction can save Steve more than $960. Nearly three times as much as Dan for the exact same mortgage payments. It doesn't stop there. Steve can buy a second home, deduct the interest, and save even more. Or he can get a mortgage for his yacht, count it as a second home, and deduct the interest. Sorry Dan, your fishing boat doesn't count. There are deductions everywhere. The money you lose from gambling? Deduct it. Fancy business dinners? Yep. Money you put in a retirement account? That too. You can even deduct the fees you pay an accountant to help you find more deductions. And while theoretically Dan could take advantage of these same deductions the fact is, people like Steve benefit a whole lot more. People who make about $400,000 a year or more make up about 5% of taxpayers but they get more than half the benefits from these tax deductions. Now there's a third part of the tax code that Trump and the Republicans want to keep and it's even better for the richest Americans than all of these deductions The preferred rate for capital gains. Here's how it works: According to the US tax code, there are two different kinds of income. Earned income is when you go to work and somebody pays you a salary or wage a paycheck. That's earned income and we have a whole set of income tax rates for that income that go up to 39.6%. This is where Dan and Steve's tax rates come from. Unearned income means guys who trade paper. Guys who sell stock or buy commodities and then sell it. Invest in real estate properties and then sell them. That's capital income and we tax that at a lower rate. Let's say Steve earns $500,000 a year as a surgeon and Laurie earns the same amount as a hedge fund manager. Even though their income is the same, Steve's tax rate is 39.6% but Laurie's tax rate is nearly half that, 23.8%. So Steve ends up with a much higher tax bill. This is why billionaire investor Warren Buffet pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. His money comes from capital gains while hers comes from a salary. Debbie works just as hard as I do and she pays at twice the rate I pay. Ronald Reagan thought the same thing. Reagan had been a very high, high bracket taxpayer. In fact, he paid at the 90% rate in the 1950s. He was a movie star. His accountant kept telling him well sign these documents and that'll shift your income from labor to capital income and Reagan saw that that was hokey. Why should that be? Reagan's landmark 1986 tax bill tax capital income and labor income at the same rate. People said, ""Oh my God, you can't do that. Then nobody will invest. Investments will plummet."" This chart shows the value of the S&amp;P 500, a stock market metric that measures how well big businesses are doing. After Reagan raised the capital gains rate in 1986, businesses continued to prosper. Reagan's successors, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton also raise taxes and the on the wealthiest Americans. And the 1990s saw America's longest period of consecutive economic growth ever. But the changes that Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress want to make to the tax code look very different. While the Trump and GOP plans get rid of some deductions neither gets rid of the charitable contribution or mortgage interest deductions Both plans would lower taxes on capital income for people like Laurie the hedge fund manager. And both plans would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three. and cut the top tax rate. Which would mean big tax savings for someone like Steve and minimal savings for working and middle-class people like Dan. Rather than working to reduce the growing gap between the richest Americans and everyone else these new tax plans would make that gap even wider. "
176,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,kIID5FDi2JQ,"If I want to turn this globe into a flat map, I’m going to have to cut it open. In order to get this to look anything like a rectangle. I've had to cut it in places. I've had to stretch it so that the countries look all wonky. And even still, it's almost impossible to get it to lie flat. And that right there is the eternal dilemma of map makers: The surface of a sphere cannot be represented as a plane without some form of distortion. This guy proved that with math a long time ago. Since around 1500s, mathematicians have set about creating algorithms that would translate the globe into something flat. To do this, they use a process called projection. Popular rectangular maps use a cylindrical projections. Imagine putting a theoretical cylinder over the globe and projecting each point of the sphere onto the cylinder’s surface. Unroll the cylinder, and you have a flat, rectangular map. But you could also project the globe onto other objects, and how exactly a map maker projects the globe will affect what the map looks like once it’s all flattened out. And here’s the big problem: Every one of these projections comes with trade offs in shape, distance, direction and land area. Certain map projections can be either misleading or very helpful depending on what you are using them for. Here’s an example. This map is called the Mercator projection. If you’re American, you probably studied it in school. It’s the projection Google Maps uses. Mercator projection is popular for a couple of reasons. First, it generally preserves the shape of the countries. Brazil on the globe has the same shape as Brazil on the Mercator projection. But the real purpose of the Mercator projection was navigation -- it preserves direction, which is a big deal if you are trying to navigate the ocean with only a compass. It was designed so that a line drawn between two points on the map would provide the exact angle to follow on a compass to travel between those points. If we go back into a globe, you can see that this line is not shortest route. But it provides a simple, reliable way to navigate across oceans. Gerardus Mercator, who created the projection in the 16th century, was able to preserve direction by varying the distance between latitude lines while also making them straight, creating a grid of right angles.. But that created other problems. Where mercator fails is its representation of size. Look at the size of Africa as compared to Greenland. On the mercator map they look about the same size. But look at a globe for Greenland’s true size, and you’ll see it’s way smaller than Africa. By a factor of 14 in fact. If we put some dot that are all the same size on a globe, then we projected as a mercator map, we would end up with this. The circles retain their shape but are enlarged the closer you get the poles. One modern critique is that this distortion perpetuates imperialist attitudes of European domination over the southern hemisphere ""The Mercator projection has fostered imperialist attitudes for centuries and created a ethnic bias against the third world."" ""Really?"" If you want to see a map that more accurately displays size, you can use the Gall-Peters projection, which is called an equal-area map. Look at Greenland and Africa. The size comparison is now accurate. Much better than the mercator. but it’s obvious that the country shapes are now stretched. Here are the dots again so you can see how the projection preserves area while totally distorting shape. Something happened in the late 60s that would change the whole purpose of mapping and the way we think about projections. Satellites orbiting our planet started sending location and navigation data to little receiver units all over the world. This global positioning system wiped out the need for paper maps as a means of navigating both the seas and the sky. Map projection choices became less about navigational imperatives and more about aesthetics, design, and presentation. The mercator map, that vital tool of pre-GPS navigation, was shunned by cartographers who now saw it as misleading. But most web mapping tools like Google maps still use the mercator. According to Google this is because the Mercator’s ability to preserve shape and angles makes close-up views of cities more accurate -- a 90 degree left turn on the map is a 90degree left turn on the street you’re driving down. But when trying to display something on a world map, cartographers rarely use the mercator. Most modern cartographers have settled on a variety of non-rectangular projections that split the difference between totally distorting either size or shape. In 1998 The National Geographic Society adopted The Winkel tripel projection because of it’s a pleasant balance between size and shape accuracy. But the fact remains, that there is no one right projection. cartographers and mathematicians have created a huge library of available projections, each a new perspective on the planet. The best way to see what the earth really looks like is to look at a globe. But as long we use flat maps, we will deal with the tradeoffs of projections, Just remember: there’s no right answer. "
177,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,lOEqzt36JEM,"You probably know how this symbol is supposed to make you feel. And this one. This one too, even if you’re not sure exactly what it means. But what about this? This symbol — The Jolly Roger — was once one of the most feared symbols in the world. It represented death, pirates, and poison. But today, it’s associated more with treasure, blockbuster movies, or Halloween than actual danger. We are surrounded by icons that warn us: what to stay away from, what not to do, what to be afraid of. But how do you design a symbol in a way that will last across generations and languages? It turns out that is an incredibly hard thing to do. Back in the early 20th century, there was an urgent need for a new kind of warning symbol. At the time, there was no universal standard for communicating the presence of dangerous biological materials. Laboratories at the US Army used an inverted blue triangle. Those at the Navy used a pink rectangle. The Universal Postal Convention used a white staff-and-snake on a violet background. There was no consistency in the visual language used to communicate risk. That was dangerous, and could lead to accidental infections. So in 1966, a group of engineers and designers at Dow Chemical set out to create the best possible icon for biohazardous materials. They laid out six design criteria. First, it needed to be visually striking, so that it would draw immediate attention. That ruled out simple shapes like those from the Navy and Army. It also had to be unique and unambiguous, in order not to be confused with symbols used for other purposes. That ruled out the snake-and-staff, which has multiple versions and has a pretty vague meaning as a general symbol for medicine. On top of that, it had to be quickly recognizable and easily recalled. Had to be easy to stencil. And rotationally symmetrical, in order to appear identical from all angles. And lastly, it had to be acceptable to groups of all backgrounds. So the Dow Chemical team designed an experiment. Charles Baldwin, an environmental health engineer behind the experiment, said that the team “wanted something that was memorable but meaningless … so we could educate people as to what it means."" They showed a set of 24 symbols to 300 people from 25 American cities. There were 6 newly-designed biohazard markers, and 18 common symbols — things like Mr. Peanut, the Texaco star, the Shell Oil symbol, the Red Cross, and a swastika. Participants were asked to guess the meaning of each one, which was used to assign each one a “meaningfulness score.” A week later, the same participants were shown those original 24 symbols, plus 36 more. They were asked to identify which symbols they remembered seeing in the previous round of the study. Among the six competing biohazard designs, this one stood out. It scored the highest in memorability, but the lowest in meaningfulness. So it was unforgettable, but also a totally blank slate for designers who wanted to give it meaning. And with that, it became a national standard. It’s easy to overlook how much visual communication work these symbols are doing. They’re simple — you only need a straightedge and a compass to recreate them. And unlike most other hazard symbols, they don’t reference an existing physical object or idea. But they’ve remained iconic for decades, helping people recognize serious dangers that may remain a threat for thousands of years to come. And that raises the question: could the meaning of those symbols stand the test of time? Few people have pondered that question quite like Gregory Benford. He’s a physicist and science fiction author. In the 1990s, he was invited to work on the Waste Isolation Pilot Project, or WIPP. The WIPP is a massive storage site for radioactive waste in the southeastern plains of New Mexico, organized by the US Department of Energy. Benford was brought in to help calculate the probability that someone or something would intrude on the site for as long as it remains dangerous — approximately the next 10,000 years. “Well, name anything that has persisted for 10,000 years. Any institution. There isn't any. The record is probably something like the Catholic Church or the core of the Jewish religion, which tells us something about what really lasts.” The meaning of a symbol can change over time. Like the Jolly Roger, which wouldn't work for the radioactive threat at the WIPP. ""If you're approaching the WIPP facility and you see a skull and crossbones you might think, ‘Hey this is where the pirates buried their treasure.’” So how do you indicate a long lasting danger across any language? Since the 1970s, engineers, anthropologists, physicists, and behavioral scientists have proposed different solutions to that problem. One strategy was to add context to the symbol. By illustrating cause and effect in a three-part cartoon like this, designers could communicate the idea even if the symbol lost its meaning. But this kind of visual communication still made a lot of assumptions about the user: that they would read left to right, that they would understand causality between frames — and, of course, that the drawing itself would last millennia of wear and tear. So other designers started to focus on creating a warning without inscribed communication, by altering the shape of the location itself. And that yielded designs like this. Spike fields, forbidding blocks, giant pyramids: these designs capitalized on natural instincts of fear and discomfort to keep people away. But even then, they weren’t foolproof. Designers couldn’t be sure whether they would be perceived as terrifying or fascinating. “Conflict between these two urges: you want people to notice it but you don't want people to go there. Those are always going to fight each other.” So without symbols, without basic illustrations, or physical structures, how can you effectively communicate a warning? That’s where the more philosophical design solutions come in. In 1984, the German Journal of Semiotics published a series of solutions from various scholars. Linguist Thomas Sebeok proposed creating an atomic priesthood, where an exclusive political group would use its own rituals and myths to preserve information about the radioactive areas. And philosophers François Bastide and Paolo Fabbri proposed to genetically engineer bioluminescent cats that would glow in the presence of radioactivity. By creating songs and traditions about the danger of glowing cats, the warning could last as long as the oldest relics of civilization we have: culture. There’s no definitive solution for warning people far into the future. But designing clear, inclusive symbols will continue to be a fundamental part of how we keep people safe. We will change, and so will the ways we communicate visually. Our warning symbols will have to change along with us. "
178,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,lxMWSmKieuc,"Vladimir Putin has been ruling Russia since 1999. In that time he's shaped the country into an authoritarian and militaristic society. He successfully invaded two of Russia's neighbors and strengthened ties with Syria and Iran. He's intent on pushing back against the Western world order... and it appears to be working. [Vladimir Putin, 17 years in power. The most powerful man in the world] To understand how one man could have such a powerful influence on his country, you need to go back to the chaos and corruption that gripped Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union. When the Berlin walll fell, a 40 year old Putin was working as an undercover spy in East Germany for the Soviet security agency the KGB. The Soviet Union dissolved into 15 new countries, including the new Russian Federation. In Putin's eyes Russia had just lost two million square miles of territory. He later called this a major geopolitical disaster of the century. Lamenting that tens of millions of his co-patriots found themselves outside Russian territory. The new government had to sell off nearly 45,000 public businesses like energy, mining, and communication companies that had been run by the communist regime. And it was chaos. The Russian economy was in a freefall and all these companies ended up in the hands of a few extremely wealthy men, known today as Russia's oligarchs. At the same time the new Russian state was having a hard time establishing itself. Russia's first president Boris Yeltsin was wildly unpopular for cooperating with the west. And to make matters worse he was an alcoholic and many Russians thought he was an embarrassment. In order to stay in power, he leaned on the support of these oligarchs, surrendering an immense amount of political power to them. This graph shows how inequality actually worsened after the fall of the Soviet Union. This is where Vladimir Putin enters politics. He leaves the KGB in 1991 and becomes the deputy mayor of St. Petersburg. Putin uses his position to give special treatment to friends and allies in the private sector. He helps them structure monopolies and regulates their competitors, quickly becoming a favorite among the oligarchs. Before long he's assembled a support network of oligarchs, crime bosses, and security officials, mostly fellow former KGB officers like he was. With their help he rapidly ascends to the upper echelon of the new Russian state. In 1999, president Boris Yeltsin appoints Putin, still relatively unknown in national politics, to be the prime minister. A fierce nationalist, Putin feared Yeltsin was letting the US dominate Russia and that NATO, the alliance that worked for decades to contain Soviet influence, would expand into the new liberated countries and surround Russia. Putin's goal then became to build a strong Russian state, one that would be both stable at home and capable of exercising more influence over its neighbors. And he quickly got his chance... During the post-Soviet chaos there was escalating violence in Chechnya, a region thatinformally seceded from Russia in the mid-90s. Chechen war lords and terrorists were pushing into Russian territory and attacking the border. In August 1999, a series of deadly bombings killed more than 300 people in several Russian cities, including Moscow. Putin, the new prime minister, immediately blames Chechen separatists for the attack. He regularly appears in Russian television claiming he will avenge Russia. The population quickly rallies around him. Putin's approval ratings jump from 2% before the bombing to forty-five percent after the bombings. Journalists later uncovered evidence that suggests Russian security services could have been complicit in the Moscow bombings, perhaps knowing they would spark support for a strong man like Putin. But a closed state investigation quickly quashed any dissenting theories. So Russia launches a popular and devastating war in Chechnya. The capital city of Grozny was leveled by Russian bombing and some estimated close to 80 thousand people died. And in less than a year russia successfully brings Chechnya back under its control. In December 1999 Yeltsin resigns making Putin the interim president. In May, during the bloody campaign in Chechnya, Putin wins the presidential election. He begins to shape the Russian state to his vision. Patronage and corruption remain some of his key tools, but he quickly suppresses the oligarchs under his rule. Those that support Putin are rewarded, those that don't are eliminated. ""Well once Russia's richest man, imprisoned Kremlin critic and former oil magnate, Mikhail Khodorkovsky was sentenced to 14 years in jail. This on a new conviction of embezzling oil. This is effectively a vendetta from Vladimir Putin. for getting involved in opposition of politics."" With the oligarchy tamed, Putin was now free to move his vision outside of Russia's borders. At the time relations with the US are fairly good. Putin even vacationed at George W. Bush's summer home. ""I looked a man in the eye I found him to be very straightforward and trustworthy"". But things were about to change... In August 2008, Russia invades Georgia, a former Soviet republic. It's a display of aggression and strength on behalf of pro-Russian separatists there. Russia quickly annexes two small parts of Georgia, drawing condemnation from all over the world. Interestingly though Putin was not president during the invasion. See, the Russian Constitution says the president can only serve two consecutive terms, but sets no limit on the total number of terms one can serve. So Putin took the Prime Minister role again when his hand-picked successor Dmitry Medvedev served as president. When Obama is elected US president in 2008, he attempts to reset relations with Russia. And they make some progress. Most notably to limit both country's nuclear arsenals. But Putin remains paranoid about US intentions and remains opposed to these new relations. He's particularly bothered by US interventions in the Middle East, especially in Libya in 2011. He publicly criticized Medvedev for not vetoing the action in the UN Security Council. Putin announces his candidacy for president and wins the 2012 election by a preposterous margin. ""Injustice says Dmitry this outrage can't continue. I'm here to say no to Putin"". Putin starts his third term once again amid chaos. He doubles down on his authoritarian governance style at home and his militaristic strategy abroad. But in both cases, he showcases a mastery of information. He first took office in 2000, Putin has kept tight leash on Russian television. Essentially all news outlets are state-owned propaganda machines. His regime decides which stories air and how, always depicting him as the strong Russian leader. In 2012, he cracked down on human rights and civil liberties, making clear there was no room for dissent in his Russia. Using state television for example he administered a blistering campaign against a feminist and gay rights music group Pussy Riot. ""The latest of the loudest of such performance for the so-called punk prayer the Christ the Savior cathedral where they were yelling things which were rather profane to be yelled in Church. Of course, three members of the punk group Pussy Riot were convicted and sentenced to two years in prison. Putin also bolstered his aggressive foreign strategy. He used traditional military methods like sending weapons and fighter planes to help dictator Bashar al-Assad fight a bloody civil war in Syria. But Putin's regime has also developed and fostered the most effective cyber army in the world and he's used it to wreak havoc in the West. These hackers have stolen classified US information hacked politicians email accounts, even shut down Georgia's internet while Russian troops invaded. And of course, they tried to sabotage Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in 2016. Russian hackers have also launched propaganda campaigns in support of right-wing candidates in Europe. With this, Putin hopes to exploit and deepen the political divide in Western democracies. In 2014, the Putin vision culminated in the targeting of Ukraine; another former Soviet country. Ukraine's president was opening up to the west and Putin feared he would join NATO. So Russian hackers launched a propaganda campaign against him stoking protests in the pro-Russia eastern part of the country. He then sent in disguised Russian troops and before long violence erupted. In goes the Russian military and in early 2014, Putin annexed Crimea. He continues to support the fighting in Ukraine and as of 2017 over 9,000 people have died. The world erupts in protest but Putin doesn't give in. See his aggressive foreign policy successfully weakens his neighbors while also rallying Russians around him. But he has done all this at the expense of his own people. His invasions have prompted harsh sanctions from the west, barring Russian businesses from trading in Western markets. Russian currency has plummeted in value and the energy industry that Russia relies on is collapsing. It's hard to imagine Russia can continue under these circumstances. But the election of Donald Trump brings new hope for the Putin vision. Trump's rhetoric has been notably soft on Russia. He could lift sanctions and weaken NATO, potentially freeing up space for Putin's Russia to become a dominant power once again. "
179,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,mlDBgOkxgS8,"Check out that building with a hole in it. Here in Hong Kong there are dragons floating everywhere. You can't really see them, because you know they're dragons. They actually live up in the mountains and they come down into the water and when you block them from entering the water you end up really messing up your luck. So they have accommodated this situation by putting holes in the buildings so that the dragons can fly through. These are called dragon gates and they are one of many examples of how Feng Shui, the ancient Chinese practice, is affecting the skyline of Hong Kong. So Feng Shui is this ancient Chinese belief, superstition. The basic idea is that there is good energy out there floating around, good luck, good fortune called Qi and if you arrange your physical environment in an optimal way, you can channel that good luck in the best way and things will go good for you. This usually takes the form of like furniture, interior design but here in Hong Kong, it has affected the skyline. Alright, first let's look at this HSBC building. The Hong Kong Shanghai Bank was founded back in the days of pirates and opium barons. First thing you'll notice is that it's nicely squared off, with the mountains in the back and harbor in the front. This is really good composition for the Qi to flow. Not only is the lobby elevated but it's also the escalators are at this angle. It's kind of a weird looking angle. That's intentional as well, because it's actually meant to fend off the bad luck as it's coming through this hole in the bottom of the building. And then of course the opposite is true; if you don't arrange your physical environment in an optimal way, then bad luck will befall you. Right next door is the Communist Bank of Red China. The developers of this building explicitly ignored the Feng Shui masters who were concerned that the sharp angles of this design would cut the good Qi and create bad luck for all of the surrounding buildings. The people who thought this had their suspicions reinforced when shortly after the building was complete, bad stuff started happening around it. Like to this neighboring building, which has been riddled with financial insecurity, corporate collapse, bankruptcies, since it's very beginning. And Feng Shui masters have come out and cited the bad Feng Shui of the area as a major cause for these events. Governor of Hong Kong at the time, whose house sits in the shadow of this building, died of a fatal heart attack just one year after this building was complete. So the HSBC building, in response, put up these maintenance cranes that actually look like cannons and they're pointed right at the Bank of China, in order to combat all of this bad luck that's coming from this sharp building. When developers are designing and putting up these buildings, they hire these Feng Shui consultants. They spend millions of dollars on consultants who will give them advice and approve their design decisions, to make sure that they're in keeping with good Feng Shui. Out here in Disneyland Hong Kong, the Feng Shui masters said that the entrance was in a bad position for keeping good luck in the park. So they shifted the entrance by 12 degrees in order to create a blockade from the good luck escaping the park and ruining the prosperity of this place. Feng Shui comes from China, mainland China, but during the Cultural Revolution China kind of stamped out some of these old practices that they believed were holding the society back. And Feng Shui fell victim to that, but Hong Kong at that time was ruled by the British. It was a British colony, so it didn't fall subject to that Cultural Revolution and Feng Shui was preserved in a very mainstream way. Check out this building, it's the Hopewell Center. When this thing went up, people freaked out because it kind of looked like a candle or like a smoking cigarette. They put a swimming pool on the top, in order to extinguish the fire and make sure that it didn't mess with the good luck of the city. The government takes this stuff really seriously too. Between 2011 and 2016 they paid out $1.1 million dollars in Feng Shui disturbance subsidies. This is paid out to people who complain that new constructions disrupt their Fung Shui and they get compensated by the government. So next time you are crossing this harbor to look at these beautiful buildings, just remember that Feng Shui is at is at play in Hong Kong's skyline. "
180,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,mmceh9nIbBY,"When Hollywood does any kind of movie or TV show about counterterrorism, about spying, they tend to have Jack Bauer doing something dramatic. They have James Bond doing something dramatic. They have Carrie Mathison doing something emotional and dramatic. You said you had information about an attack. But it’s, like, one person, in one dangerous place, doing one powerful thing. And that’s not the way the world actually works. In reality, the US relies on a web of intelligence-sharing agreements with other countries. The best known is the Five Eyes agreement between the US, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia. But the US also gets intel from countries that are geographically closer to terrorism hot spots. Jordan, Saudi Arabia, the Emirates , Turkey, Israel, These countries often have agents undercover inside groups like ISIS. They get something valuable, they trust us with it. That could be an intercept of a phone call, drone imagery showing somebody that one country is looking for. It could be a plot. This was the case in 2010, when intelligence sharing between the US and six other countries stopped an al-Qaeda plot to bomb two cargo planes en route to the US. And what makes it all work, what kind of greases that relationship, is trust. They believe that if they tell us a secret, that it’s safe. One of the most important of these intelligence-sharing relationships is the one between the United States and the Israelis. So, when the Israelis found out about a specific threat from ISIS, that they planned to use laptops to bomb airplanes, The New York Times reports that the Israelis shared that information with the US, with the understanding it would stay secret. But the Washington Post reports that President Trump shared that information with the Russian foreign minister during his visit to the US. And in doing so, he seriously jeopardized that relationship with the Israelis. To understand why, you have to back up a little bit and look at what Russia is doing in Syria. President Trump has said Russia is a key ally in the fight against ISIS there. Trump: I say it's better to get along with Russia than not. And if Russia helps us in the fight against ISIS, which is a major fight, and Islamic terrorism all over the world — major fight —that's a good thing. The problem is that, in Syria, Russia’s goal is not to fight ISIS. Russia’s goal is to protect Bashar al-Assad. Russia fights ISIS only insofar as it sees ISIS as a threat to Bashar A\al-Assad. And one of Russia’s main partners in this objective is Iran, who the Israelis consider to be their greatest threat in the region. The greatest danger that we face of the hatred for the Jewish people and the Jewish state, comes from the East. It comes from Iran. For months, Israeli spies have expressed this fear that any intelligence they shared with the US could end up, via Russia, in the hands of the Iranians. And Now those fears have been confirmed. If they no longer trust the CIA, that means that the plot that might have otherwise been stopped or disrupted potentially happens. Because they don’t trust that if they tell it to us, that it won’t go to an enemy of theirs. And it’s not just Israel. Now other allies may become wary of sharing intelligence with the US. Without trust, these intelligence-sharing relationships break down. And without these relationships, it’s harder for US intelligence officials to do the very thing Trump says he wants to accomplish: defeat ISIS and disrupt terror plots. "
181,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,o2dvXWX3Sdw,"When I say “funeral” this is probably what you think of, right? The cemetery, the casket, the gorgeous floral arrangements. Vin Diesel stylishly going two buttons undone on the dress shirt. But what if I told you that other than Dominic Toretto’s effortless style, this was probably the worst way you could dispose of a body? This traditional casket in the ground method most of us are used to is what journalist Mark Harris calls a “modern burial.” And that is the chemical embalming of the remains, the burial of the body or the placement of the body into a metal casket, and then the placing of that casket and embalmed body in the bottom of the grave that we call the burial vault. So that’s pretty much the American way of death. Aside from being a great name for a novel, the American way of death actually turns out to be pretty terrible. The average cost of modern burial runs on average from $10,000 to $12,000. Although you can talk to families who will tell you they paid a lot more than that. In many cases, a lot more. This KISS casket alone will set you back seven grand. No word on if the amps are included though. The funeral industry has also been known to engage in predatory business practices, like selling vulnerable families add-ons and services that they don’t need. They’ve also been the subject of a number of class action lawsuits, including one for conspiring to fix the prices of caskets at artificially high prices. “Modern” burials are also incredibly wasteful. The average grave site takes up 32 square feet of land in a cemetery. And that’s just space. It uses a staggering amount of resources as well. Which almost sounds kind of fun right? Grill up some hotdogs, toss some diving rings in for the kids to fetch. Not so fast. Formalin, which is the formaldehyde-based preservative solution embalmers use, is incredibly toxic. OSHA deems it a dangerous carcinogen and strictly regulates its use, and the EPA treats it as a hazardous waste. Embalmers experience higher levels of brain, colon, and prostate cancer as well as leukemia. To embalm a typical body it requires 3 pounds of this formalin solution and sends 120 gallons of untreated “funeral waste” directly into the sewage system, including blood, water, fecal matter, organ fluid, and carcinogenic chemicals, as well as whatever unknown diseases the body contains. Okay cool, so modern funerals suck. But what are the other options? Well, let’s start with cremation. Countries all across the world cremate bodies. In Great Britain, 75% of people get cremated, in Switzerland it’s 85%, and in Japan that number is almost 100%. Two years ago, for the first time in this country’s history, more Americans were cremated than buried and then pretty soon we’re going to hit 50% of Americans being cremated. For one thing, it’s a lot cheaper. A typical cremation costs around $1,400 compared to the $10,000 to $12,000 price tag we mentioned earlier. (Again, a little more for that sweet KISS casket.) Cremating a body also requires much less space, since there doesn’t need to be a grave. And it doesn’t require a swimming pool full of formaldehyde either … sorry kids. You can also do all sorts of fun stuff with your ashes like put them in fireworks, spread them in a National Park, or even turn them into a reef. But is it actually better  for the environment? So it sounds like cremation is better, although it’s far from perfect. Is there no way to do this without hurting the environment? Swedish scientists asked that same question and developed something called promession. It’s a process where you freeze a corpse in liquid nitrogen, rapidly vibrate the body so it breaks into millions of tiny particles in just a few minutes, then freeze dry the particles and remove the harmful metals leftover from your dental fillings. You’re left with a fine dust which actually looks very similar to cremated remains. It solves most of the problems of “modern” burial and cremation but unfortunately hasn’t been approved for human beings yet. Another option is alkaline hydrolysis, where a body is put into a chamber which is then filled with water and lye, pressurized, and heated up to about 320 °F. The body tissue is broken down in a process that’s similar to natural decomposition, and dissolved to nothing but a skeleton in about 12 hours. Damn, spooky. It’s more environmentally friendly since there’s zero toxic emissions and it has about one-tenth of the carbon footprint as a cremation. All that said, the simplest option might be natural burial. A number of natural cemeteries have sprung up across the country where unembalmed bodies are buried in biodegradable containers, or sometimes nothing at all, and allowed to decompose naturally. It’s inexpensive, natural, and can actually help preserve and restore vulnerable land and wildlife. Not to mention it’s how humans have done it for most of recorded history. No matter what the method, though, it’s clear that we have to reform the way that we bury the dead. In less than a quarter-century 76 million people in America alone will get to the average life expectancy of 78 years. If all those people were buried in traditional graves, we'd need a cemetery the size of Las Vegas to accommodate their bodies. The point is, we're all going to die. The question is, what are we going to do with all the bodies? "
182,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,p0242yFKRpU,"Look at this picture. You know the music we’ll play. Even if you have the volume off. “I’ll find you...” Nope. “I’m ready for my closeup…” No. Yep. Why is this song the “graduation song?” How did “Pomp and Circumstance” become the soundtrack to every...single...graduation? Its path — and fate — is surprising. And to understand it, you have to know about the British empire’s war for gold. Let’s get technical first: this song is part of Edward Elgar’s Pomp and Circumstance Military Marches. Specifically, it’s the tune from 1901’s March No. 1 in D. “Land of Hope and Glory” is the version with words. But to get there, you have to go back. In 1901, Queen Victoria was coming to the end of her 63 year, seven month reign. That period marked a big expansion of the British Empire. In 1901, a central conflict was the Boer War in South Africa. It was basically fought over packed diamond and gold mines. Boers were the Dutch South Africans opposing Britain. Black South Africans were largely caught in the crossfire, though some fought with the Boers. For all South Africans, the war was brutal. The British destroyed a lot of territory and built incredibly harsh internment camps. For the British, that was the march of empire. That fight was in the background when Queen Victoria died in 1901. When her eldest son, Edward VII, prepared to be coronated in 1902, he needed a program. At that time, Edward Elgar was already famous, and so was his military march. So Edward VII asked him to play it at the coronation and add some words. Elgar got AC Benson to write lyrics, and they were….warlike. Here’s an early recording sung by Dame Clara Butt. “Land of Hope and Glory, Mother of the Free, How shall we extol thee, who are born of thee? Wider still and wider shall thy bounds be set;” Just a second, Dame Butt. Rewind that. “Wider still and wider.” “Wider still” means empires expanding, for the coronation of a king. And the name “Pomp and Circumstance” comes from an Othello quote about, well, here’s Orson Welles: “Pomp and circumstance of glorious war.” This song’s about empire. So why do Americans think it’s about graduation? Pomp and Circumstance was a near instant hit in America, too. The tune was famous from its premiere, and it was quickly used in graduations. In 1905, the University of Chicago and University of Cincinnati both used Edward Elgar’s March at their commencements. Later that same year, Elgar went to Yale to get an honorary degree for his world famous compositions. In his honor, they played Pomp and Circumstance, without lyrics, as the ceremony ended. The New Haven Morning Journal called it “a military march,” but early elite adoption helped it spread across universities. For example, here’s the University of Minnesota’s commencement programs from 1900 to 1950. Here are the ceremonies where Pomp and Circumstance played. In 1931, the tune was so popular that Elgar recorded it for a record — it was the very first session recorded at Abbey Road Studios. Yes, the Beatles Abbey Road. The song established a legacy. That legacy just depended on which country you were hearing it in. In the UK, Pomp and Circumstance remained like an unofficial national anthem, while in the US it became graduation kitsch. That’s obvious in the parodies: in Kubrick’s Clockwork Orange, the song satirizes government. In Disney’s Fantasia 2000, the joke is about a graduation march. Elgar wears a mortarboard in America and a crown in the UK. But in either case, his military march endures, even if it’s not fully understood. The British Empire has shrunk, but the song Elgar wrote for it? It grows mightier. Take it away, Dame Butt: God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet, God, who made thee mighty, make thee mightier yet. So this is probably not the first time this has happened, but I wanted to call out that we actually got the idea for this video from a comment. So thank you for that comment — and that is the reason that you have just learned the history of Pomp and Circumstance and that I have had this song stuck in my head for the past two weeks. "
183,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,pS0GGcz7wN4,"What is the earliest age that a baby can learn how to swim? &nbsp;My family has been testing this with my nephew. He was only 6 months old when we enrolled him in classes with a group called Infant Swimming Resource. Now, of course he's not ""swimming."" babies this young aren’t developmentally ready to move themselves forward through the water. Instead the goal was to teach him to survive. I have to say I was a bit skeptical when I first saw these clips. How could a baby who can’t even walk or talk learn how to float. I mean, it kind of looks like torture. But before a month had passed, my nephew proved me wrong. Every day 2 American families lose a child to drowning. Drowning deaths are declining overall but it is still the #1 killer of kids ages 1-4, aside from birth defects. And Arizona, where my nephew lives, has a higher drowning rate than average, which isn't surprising given that in the Phoenix area, 43% of homes have a swimming pool. These classes they put my nephew in should really be the 3rd line of defense. The first is a fence wraps around the pool latches shut, second is constant supervision. But if those safeguards fail and a baby slips into the water, it sounds kind of farfetched but the question is what skills, if any, can the baby use to keep itself alive? That’s where ISR comes in “It’s completely different than other programs that are out there.” This is Jennifer, one of my nephew’s instructors. “There’s not a lot of singing and games even though there’s a ton of positive reinforcement.” She told me that unlike other programs where kids might play in the pool or use floaties, ISR classes are geared entirely toward preparing a baby for an emergency situation. The instructor is shaping his behavior through basic operant conditioning. When he positions his body correctly in a float that behavior is reinforced with a good breath of air and with her picking him up. They did this every day for a few weeks and by the end my nephew could put himself into a float after being tipped in face-down. They also tested him with clothes on because in most drowning situations, the child is clothed. Now that he’s 1 year old and he's walking, he’s enrolled in the second set of lessons, which teaches him to look for the stairs and swim toward them under water, taking breaks to float when he needs air on the way. So is all of this good for him? Some people worry that this type of lesson is traumatizing. My nephew certainly doesn't like the lessons, and doesn't really like Jennifer. “If they're not happy with me, I’m the teacher, I’m the bad guy. But just as long as they’re successful in all the skills that are being taught.” He never developed a fear of the pool. And his tears don’t seem that different from the ones that come when he doesn’t want to take a nap. They also keep the lessons to just 10 minutes a day to reduce any health risks of being in the pool. The American Academy of Pediatrics says swimming lessons for kids 1 year and up can be effective in preventing drownings, but they don’t support programs for babies younger than that. “The water-survival skills programs for infants may make compelling videos for the Internet, but no scientific study has yet demonstrated these classes are effective.” What they’re really worried about is that these classes could give parents a false sense of security - if they made parents even a little less vigilant, they would do more harm than good. So the doctors are waiting for more data. But for my family, there’s kind of only one data point that we really care about right now. The #1 goal is to make sure he'll really be tested. But if my nephew does find himself suddenly under water, it won’t be the first time that he’s had to find his way back up. "

It was to prove that Hill's memory was faulty. Soon enough, senators were suggesting that Hill might be imagining things.

By the end of the hearing, more Americans supported Thomas than had before Hill had testified, and he was confirmed to the Supreme Court. Twenty years later, history is repeating itself.

We're supposed to believe that she precisely remembers that Kavanaugh is the assailant when she can't even say where the assault took place. But this fixation on how well a victim can remember exactly what happened to them: It's bullshit. And experts say it's getting in the way of us taking credible sexual assault allegations seriously. In the weeks since Christine Blasey Ford accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her at a high school party, a lot of attention has been paid to Ford's memory of the event. Ford admits that she can't remember some important details, like the exact date of the party, whose house it was at, or how she got there. Notes taken by Ford's therapist in 2012 also state four boys were in the room during the time of the assault. But Ford says there were two and says the discrepancy was due to an error on the therapist's part. Those gaps and inconsistencies have triggered a barrage of speculation about whether Ford's memory can actually be trusted. How reliable is a memory from 1982? She can't tell you where it was, how she got there. A Washington Post columnist even suggested that Ford might have Kavanaugh confused with a lookalike, asking, “Is there a Kavanaugh doppelganger?” You can see this focus on memory especially on Fox News. This is nothing. She's not sure when it happened, where it happened. Alleged victim does not know the address, the date, the owner of the house. Why? This chart shows that Fox talked about Ford's allegations in the context of memory more often than the other cable news networks. And it's easy to guess why. Why? We have this expectation that for an allegation to be credible, the victim has to be able to recall exactly what happened to them, in detail. Most of us think memory works like a video camera, accurately recording events we see and hear so that we can review them later. So if a victim can't remember certain details, we view them as suspicious. After all, if they can't remember everything, how can they even be sure they got raped? But if you talk to experts who study memory, they all say the same thing: That's not how it works. Human memory is faulty. We're prone to forget or misremember information, even if we experienced it clearly. And I could show you a study on this, or we could just do an experiment. I started this video by showing you a clip of the Anita Hill hearing. Do you remember what Hill was wearing? Who was the first senator you saw speaking? What year was the hearing? Are you sure you saw the clip? Now you might be thinking, “Yeah, but if I was getting harassed or assaulted, I would remember more.” But actually, the opposite is true. You tend to narrow your focus when you're in a traumatic situation. There are certain parts of it you remember better and other parts that your brain said, “That's peripheral, I gotta focus on staying alive.” It's worth remembering what Ford is accusing Kavanaugh of. She says he pinned her down, groped her, and covered her mouth. She worried that he might inadvertently kill her. Imagine trying to remember that Anita Hill clip if you watched it while fearing for your life. In a piece for Time magazine, researchers James Hopper and David Lisak explain that intense fear affects the hippocampus, impairing our ability to store contextual information like the layout of a room or the passage of time. This doesn't mean memories are useless. Victims remember big, core details about what happened to them. But they often recall those memories in ways that look suspicious to the rest of us. Many survivors try not to think about what happened to them. And so when people start to ask them very detailed questions, it is not unusual for there to be some inconsistencies. Details of that day before or after may not be clear in their mind. But the part that they are clear occurred would be the violation. In one survey, researchers asked people who had experienced attempted or completed rape to recall their experiences and then compared their stories to people describing other intense experiences. The study found that memories of rape were rated as less clear and vivid, less likely to occur in a meaningful order, and less well-remembered than other intense memories. If people are expecting that a victim should be able to just replay a video and describe it the same every time, that's not how the brain works, and that's not how the brain works for any kind of trauma, not just sexual assault. In other words, we're holding trauma survivors to a standard that most of them won't be able to meet. And when they fail that standard — when they forget something or contradict themselves — the punishment is brutal. Anita Hill was famously described as “a little bit nutty and a little bit slutty” after her hearing. Ford has been accused of being a political operative… Political smear masquerading as a sexual assault allegation. Of being hypnotised… Was there hypnosis? Are they using confabulation? And of being mentally deranged. She's going to look like the loon that she is. If you're wondering why so many women are hesitant to come forward, this is why. Days after Ford's story went public, a second accuser, Deborah Ramirez, came forward with allegations that Kavanaugh had thrust his penis in her face during a party in college. Ramirez told the New Yorker that watching the smear campaign against Ford had made her frightened to share her own story, which she knew would be attacked due to gaps in her memory. In the case of Deborah Ramirez, that's a very sketchy allegation. She didn't remember very well. She's had a lot to drink, she said. She had a lot to drink. None of this is to say that we shouldn't question or investigate allegations of sexual assault. An investigation is exactly what Kavanaugh's accusers are asking for. But as long as we expect trauma victims to have crystal-clear memories of what happened, we're going to keep finding reasons to doubt them, regardless of how credible their allegations are. "
185,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,q8fAe2X6c-8,"-Liz, why are we going to Ikea? Because we're going to unite the Democratic Party. And also, I kind of want meatballs. You would think that uniting a party running against a Republican billionaire that calls Mexicans rapists and women fat pigs would be a piece of cake. But guess again. Are you voting for Hillary in the fall? No way. No, no, no. No. Not at all. No. No, I couldn’t. I am not. There's no way in hell I'm voting for Hillary. Despite Hillary clinching the nomination and Bernie himself endorsing Clinton, a large number still refuse to put their support behind the Democratic candidate. Of course, the DNC email leak confirmed what many Bernie Sanders supporters were already feeling: That the party favored Clinton and that they never stood a chance. The Bernie or Bust movement persists with a YouGov survey showing that only 44% of people who voted for Sanders in the primaries intend to vote for Hillary Clinton come this fall. And this is bad news for her. For instance, in the battleground state of Pennsylvania polls show that Clinton only has a 1% lead over Donald Trump. But if she could get half of Sanders supporters behind her that lead could go up. I wanted to know if I could find a way to bridge this gap. Using a method devised by a therapist to help practice better communication, we had our subjects construct a small night table. We locked up Katie, a self described Bernie Bro, and Ben, a Hillary supporter, in a room with no AC, no water, and with one frustratingly simple task. What could go wrong? Oh my God. Let's take these screws and secure them. And unscrew America. Yeah. But screw together this weird a** table. What Bernie Sanders did is amazing. Bernie Sanders engaged an audience of voters that have never been engaged like that before. Literally, he broke records. But some of those people aren't politically experienced. They haven't seen how our democratic system works, and so they get angry when they don't get the results they want. Every single step of the way Hillary's defenders, not all of them, but I'll say the most vocal and closest to the campaign, have been pushing back on all efforts to hold her at all accountable and move her to the left. Katie, that's not true. Look at Social Security, Where Hillary Clinton has changed her– But that wasn't because of– That was because of progressive voices coming together and fighting to push her to the left. Okay, I'm talking about the people who– and you're not this– but there are lots of supporters of Hillary who attack Bernie people and say that they have to get in line and that they're going to let Trump win. What Donald Trump is trying to do is to make America more hateful, more racist, more xenophobic -I know this, he's terrible. Then oppose him. I am opposing him but I think you can do it better if you don't try to beat Bernie people over the head and blame them. All I'm saying is that we have a real threat to this country, to marginalized communities across this country, and the way to combat it is to encourage as many people as possible to get out and vote against Trump. And right now the other option is Secretary Clinton. If you don't like that option, which makes sense for a lot of people, then push her to be more like the person that you want her to be. After almost an hour, they still hadn't reached consensus or successfully built a night table. But still, data shows that although there are some differences between Sanders and Clinton supporters, there is an even bigger ideology gap between Trump and the Bernie camp. So what gives? One factor might be who's voting for Bernie in the first place. According to data from FiveThirtyEight, the Sanders campaign attracted voters who are less likely to vote in elections. Add to the mix their declining view of Hillary Clinton over the course of the primary and it's not hard to understand the discord. So when I spoke to FiveThirtyEight's Harry Enten it wasn't Ikea that he suggested as a solution to Hillary Clinton's Bernie Bro woes. What does Hillary need to do to really get a grasp on this coalition of voters? I think one of the things she already did, they adopted a very progressive platform. I think that could get the activists on her side and then those activists could be thought of as leaders and people look to them. I mean for a long time we've been dividing, right– it's a two-party system, it's Republican, Democrat. Could we be seeing a shift in terms of how people affiliate? Could it change to insider and outsider, or establishment or anti-establishment? Absolutely, I mean we've seen a number of votes in the House over the past few years in which, you know, people who were part of the establishment– so called, I don't know if that's necessarily a good title, but part of the establishment – voted together while those on the far left and the far right who are really outsiders, voted together. It's quite possible that in fact we do see a multi-dimensional system. In fact, that's the way it's been throughout most of our history. It's only been more recently where we've been able to put things on a left and right spectrum. So why can't things change? There's nothing special about the system we have now. Bernie supporters have had a huge impact on the Democratic Party and changed the way that we view the two-party system. But now that their candidate has endorsed Hillary, where do they go from here? Will they back her and work within the system, or will their disappointment encourage them to opt out or vote for a third party? Or they do have another option. Bernie Sanders voters, please, vote for Trump. Come on over, the water's fine. We welcome you to the Republican Party. You may not feel comfortable at the beginning– So consider Donald Trump, people, it's for God and country. Come to the other side, we'll welcome you with open arms. I totally welcome all of you Bernie supporters to the Trump team. It's so inspiring, it really shows how we can work together. Not to construct anything or debate but in theory we can work together. Organize so Hillary Clinton is more electable and doesn't get defeated by Trump. Just cut to that. Okay, editors. Let's cut there, we got it. We got the shot. "
186,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,qAOKOJhzYXk,"These images of a swarm of locusts are from the BBC’s groundbreaking Planet Earth series in 2006. And this footage comes from the brand new sequel to that program — this is Planet Earth 2. You might notice the improvement in resolution from HD to Ultra-HD. But another big change is that in Planet Earth 2, it’s not just the grasshoppers that are moving. The cameras are moving too. These dynamic tracking shots are part of the reason why Planet Earth 2 is the BBC’s most cinematic wildlife film yet. GUNTON: We know when we go to the cinema now the camera’s never static. It's always on the move, it’s always on a steadicam, it’s always on tracks, it’s always flying. And I think we wanted to reflect that in our approach. Not just because we wanted to do homage to cinema but because the reason why cinema does that is because as soon as you have that sense of moving camera it feels more immersive, it feels more connected. Watching Planet Earth 2 feels a bit like watching a hollywood blockbuster. You almost forget that these actors are hiding in remote corners of the globe and they do not follow scripts. The BBC’s Natural History Unit in Bristol has been producing wildlife films for 60 years. Their frequent presenter, sir David Attenborough, is most recognizable voice of the genre. “This extraordinary creature is half blind, half deaf, and this is just about as fast as it can move” And through the decades, they’ve continually raised the bar for the look and feel of nature films, too. That evolution, as we’ll explore in this 3-part series, is in large part a story of technology. The first big breakthrough was lightweight, 16mm film cameras. NIGHTINGALE: If you remember, television began as a studio operation. It just had ginormous video cameras that were larger than a person. Then in the film industry, of course, that was all movies, and again, they were very, very cumbersome. There simply weren't cameras that you could take into the jungles and deserts and so on. 16mm cameras were portable, but they were controversial inside the BBC, seen as amateur cameras, since 35mm film was the broadcast standard at the time. But Attenborough insisted on the smaller cameras for his first trips overseas. And sure enough, he came back with footage of animals that had never before been filmed, like these Indri lemurs in Madagascar. Fifty-six years later, filming the Indri means moving the camera around them and traveling with them through the trees, but the technology they used to do this has only come around in the past few years. The issue is stabilization. You can see the shaking in these rare handheld shots from the BBC’s 1990 series The Trials of Life. Aerial shots had the same problem. And if they tried to zoom in, those bumps just got magnified. Producers could achieve cinematic motion with cranes, dollies, and sliders where it was practical to do so. But for decades almost all the shots that weren’t underwater involved a camera on a tripod — panning, tilting and zooming to follow the action. There’s definitely no shortage of incredible animal behavior to film that way. But it all changed around 2002. That's when BBC switched from film to digital HD cameras for the Planet Earth series. That switch gave them access to a tool called the Cineflex heligimbal, a stabilization system for a helicopter-mounted camera. The heligimbal delivered the smooth sweeping scenic shots that defined the epic look of that series. But it also let them film individual animals from a kilometer up in the sky, and zoom way in to follow them without the noise of the chopper scaring them off. And that changed the way they could capture behaviors like hunting. GUNTON: If you look at how people shot and edited hunting sequences, because of the nature of where you had to put the camera, you could never get long continuous shots because you would you get a shot on a tripod, the wolf would run off, you had to jump up and get in the land rover, run across, put the tripod down and get another shot. So it always had to be quite edited and quite constructed. Compare that to the wolf hunt in Planet Earth. GUNTON: Once that wolf started hunting you could just fly along, keep your distance and in one shot, you just see how that drama played out. And you just do not know what's gonna happen: is it gonna stumble, is gonna catch it, is the little caribou gonna run away, is it gonna stumble? It was so gripping because it was unmediated. The Cineflex system required digital cameras because it separates the lens from the camera’s data storage, which at the time was digital video cassette tape. You just can’t do that with film. The 400mm zoom lens is mounted inside a series of rings called a gimbal, that isolate it from the movement of the helicopter, with the help of small sensors called gyroscopes. Those sensors detect changes in orientation so that motors can correct for those movements almost immediately. So the camera operator can control the lens with a joystick inside the helicopter and zoom in without losing any stability. Ten years later, that stabilization technology comes in smaller, much more affordable forms. It’s embedded in drones, and built into rigs that you can hold in your hands. And that technological change aligned perfectly with what the BBC wanted to do with Planet Earth 2. GUNTON: We wanted to push the proximity, getting close to the animals because we wanted to see the world's landscapes, our planet, through the animals' eyes. Gyro-stabilized drones provided more intimate aerials, and handheld shots showed what it feels like to really move through these habitats. WHITE: I think we've gone for a much more emotional narrative in these. It's much more trying to put you in their world and what would that animal be feeling. Trying not to be anthropomorphic about it, but just sort of taking the viewer on a journey where they can start to relate to how that animal might work in that world. It's a slightly warmer, closer take on Planet Earth. Hollywood filmmakers have been able to get stabilized walking shots for decades using a Steadicam. That’s a bigger, more complicated rig that stabilizes the camera with balanced weights and a spring-loaded arm attached to a vest that the operator wears. Those long walk-and-talk shots that ER and The West Wing made famous, those are all Steadicam shots. The producers of Planet Earth 2 used Steadicams for a few sequences, like this footage of a serval cat hunting in South Africa. But it most cases Steadicams have been too cumbersome, expensive, or inflexible for shooting in the wild. Instead, the Planet Earth 2 team relied heavily on smaller handheld stabilizers. Like the heligimbal, these rigs have gyroscopes that measure orientation along 3 axes and motors that counteract those movements. These rigs are so small and versatile they can often replace several other tools like sliders and cranes. WHITE: On some of the trips, like the trip to film the penguins, we took a crane with us, we talked about taking sliders. The reality is it didn't come out of the box. Everything was done with a cameraman holding a camera on a gimbal. In an environment like that, just to be able to move around quite freely, have a camera that you can put down at penguin level but be able to pick up and get above the penguins was just so useful. Handheld stabilizers are most effective when you can get close to the animal, and a lot of animals don’t like that, so they’ll never replace tripods. Rather they add to the rapidly growing arsenal of tools becoming available not just to pros, but to everyone, to be able to get shots that look like hollywood blockbusters. But ultimately, what makes a movie great isn’t just the pictures, it’s the story. The Natural History Unit’s style has shifted over time from more educational to more cinematic, but they haven’t forgotten that. GUNTON: The imagery of course is that first thing that catches the eye, catches the attention but without the revelations the storytelling brings, in the end, it palls quite quickly. So no technology will ever replace the ability to be able to tell a story that grips and fascinates and emotionally connects with an audience. Thank you for watching! You can find Planet Earth 2 on BBC America. It will be airing Saturdays through March 25th. You can also find tons of clips from their archive on BBC Earth’s mobile app. It’s called Story of Life and it’s actually where I found a lot of the clips that I used in this video. And it’s free!

187,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,qBfyIQbxXPs,"It's graduation day at a children's school in Tokyo. From the metro station it's just ten blocks to their school, but these children aren't totally safe. Old men from their community have to stand at every corner to make sure that these kids aren't harassed or bullied. It's happened before. In fact, there's been a lot of rallies in Tokyo lately: protesting these kids and their school. This is because, even though these kids and their parents were born in Japan, they're not Japanese. This is North Korea's bubble in Japan. It's a community of about 150,000 Koreans, holdovers from the 1940's when Japan's military forcibly brought over their relatives. They run a network of schools, where they teach their kids about Korean history, teach them Korean language. They teach them the ideology of the great leader Kim Il-Sung. The guards are here this morning because three days ago, North Korea tested a bunch of missiles that landed right off Japan's shores. Before the students can leave, they have to change out of the traditional Korean clothing. But this community isn't giving in to the pressure. Their schools are the place where they can protect their identity and quietly revere their great leader and the homeland that he founded. A place none of them have ever lived. This North Korean bubble is a nation within a nation, whose borders are made out of culture, language, history, and ideology. And it shows how borders exist as much in our minds as they do on maps. In 1910 the Korean Peninsula was annexed by Japan's expanding empire. During its rule the empire brought tens of thousands of Koreans to Japan, mainly to work and to serve in their army. Or in the case of Korean women, to serve as sex slaves in brothels for Japanese soldiers. Japan's empire grew until 1945 when World War II, brought its sudden defeat and the loss of much of its empire, including Korea. The Koreans who were in Japan were free, but they found themselves in a country that didn't recognize them as citizens. The United States and the Soviet Union quickly filled the power vacuum of this newly liberated Korean Peninsula and two new countries were formed: the U.S. backing the new South Korea, and the Soviet Union backing the North, installing a rising leader, Kim Il-Sung who a few years later invaded the U.S.-backed South, starting the Korean War. Most of the Koreans in Japan went back to Korea, but about 600,000 decided to stay in Japan. The Korean War changed everything, creating a bitter division between these two new Koreas. So the Koreans in Japan could no longer just be Korean. They suddenly had to choose which Korea they affiliated with. Almost all of them had originally been from what was now South Korea, but this new North Korea began paying special attention to the Koreans in Japan, sending the money and helping them build schools and businesses. Effectively, helping them build a cultural border, to help protect their identity and language against the Japanese society that sought to change or destroy it. This school where the graduation is taking place, was built with funding from Kim Il-Sung in those early days, after the war. For these stateless Koreans in Japan, this support from a faraway government built trust and loyalty to a regime that they had never actually lived under. The North Korean backed organization in Japan called themselves the Chongryon and over the following decades they built a network of schools, banks, and gambling parlors. They became rich, and started sending millions of dollars back to North Korea to support the regime. In their heyday the Chongryon was worth around $25 billion dollars. But something happened that would mark the beginning of the end for this North Korean business empire in Japan. In the late 70's North Korea started sending spies disguised as fishermen to Japanese beaches, to start kidnapping Japanese citizens. They brought them back to North Korea so that they could use them for their language and cultural understanding of Japan, so they could help train their spies. The victims, including a 13 year old girl who allegedly died in captivity, gripped the nation's attention for years, their stories making their way into pop culture, their faces known to every citizen. Around the same time, North Korea began developing its long-range missile program, a program that would eventually lead North Korea to having nuclear weapon delivery capabilities. Both the nuclear and abduction issues came to a head in the early 2000's, when North Korea withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, a treaty that prevents countries from building more nuclear weapons. The regime also officially admitted that they were behind some of the kidnappings of Japanese citizens. This set off a wave of violent attacks and hate speech against North Koreans living in Japan. The Japanese government demanded that the Chongryon repay its outstanding debts. When the organization couldn't do this, they were forced to declare bankruptcy. Many of their buildings, including their headquarters, were seized. The organization was left in financial ruin, with only its network of a few dozen schools standing. These schools became the next target for Japanese animosity towards North Korea. Korean students suddenly found themselves in the middle of this heated international conflict. This graph shows the amount of state funding for Korean schools by Japanese prefectures over time. 2006 was the year that North Korea tested a nuclear weapon. And you can see the immediate drop-off of funding every year thereafter. Prefectures providing tuition subsidies for Korean schools went from 28 in 2006, down to 12 today. Education officials specifically cite the abduction issue as well as the general ""situation"" in North Korea, as their motive for defunding the schools. Japan's Ministry of Education declined my request for an interview on this, but I did talk to an anti-Korean activist who defended these actions by putting the issue into terms that I, as an American, could understand. As I visited these schools and talked with these people who live in a country that is openly hostile towards them, I found myself torn. This organization pledges allegiance to a regime that has committed some of the most horrific atrocities that our modern world knows. Each and every conceivable human right is violated. There are 80,000 to 100,000 people who are languishing in political prison camps. Yet at the same time, they are also victims of severe structural discrimination. The U.N. and other international bodies have repeatedly condemned the Japanese structural discrimination against Koreans. The North Korean community often cites this as validation for their plight, but the U.N. has also called North Korea's human rights violations so grave that they have ""no parallel in the contemporary world"". When you ask them how they reconcile this contradiction, the response is always some version of: ""any country has human rights issues."" At first I found this astounding, that there could be such a willful ignorance to the atrocities of the North Korean regime, but the more embedded I got into this North Korean community in Japan, the more I realized that, to this marginalized community, North Korea represents more of a refuge of safety for their identity - something they crave while they're living in a country that is actively working to diminish their heritage and culture. While younger generations are more likely to assimilate into Japanese society, the Chongryon have done an exceptional job at cultivating the strong Korean identity despite all the pressure and hardship. In their last year of high school the students have an opportunity to go visit North Korea. Seeing and hearing the accounts of this highly choreographed visit to Pyongyang, is all you need to understand the relationship that this disenfranchised community has towards its adopted homeland. I visited the North Korean university where they've curated a museum dedicated to everything Korean. Every rock, tree, species of fish, plant, animal, root, that has ever existed on the Korean Peninsula is found in this museum, which was built with support from the North Korean government. I had never seen such a meticulously comprehensive collection to enshrine a place in a history. This place does not exist for visitors. It's much more of a statement that, in spite of intense pressure and hostility, Korean culture endures in Japan. North Korea isn't their home country in the way that you would think. They weren't born there, they've never lived there, but they see it as their home country because the country that they were born in actively works to make their lives harder. Like in many parts of the world, right-wing nationalism is surging in Japan. Anti-Korean rallies are on the rise, according to an investigation by Japanese law enforcement. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is a fierce nationalist and he's caught up in a scandal right now for having given secret donations to an ultra-nationalist kindergarten with anti-Korean views. Japanese nationalism leads to discrimination against Koreans. This causes the Koreans to resist Japan as their home country, looking to a country they've never lived in for support and protection of their identity. Affiliating with this universally reviled regime, that routinely vows to destroy Japan creates more resentment from the Japanese population and politicians, leading to more discrimination which leads to again deeper commitment to North Korea as a protector. And in my mind there's no doubt that the cycle will continue. While I was in Japan making this video, I also spent a lot of time with these ultra right-wing groups who are anti-Korean and I didn't go into that much in this video, but I made an entire separate video about the rise of right-wing politics in Japan and kind of the anti-Korean sentiment and where that comes from, from like a historical perspective. And of course: big THANK YOU to lululemon who is a sponsor of Borders, they sent me these ABC pants a while back that I've been wearing. They are sturdy, and flexible and you can wear them when you're hiking or when you're at home. So thank you lululemon, but more importantly thank you for supporting Borders and making this project possible. I'm gonna leave a link here for the lululemon shop for men online, and you can check out your own pair of ABC pants. Alright, we're three episodes into Borders, we have three to go. Get ready for next Tuesday when I publish the fourth. And wish me luck in the meantime I've got a lot of editing to do. "
188,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,qJT2h5uGAC0,"This is a chart that has never been seen before. This one hasn’t either nor has this one. None of these have. That because I made them, along with Matt here. My name is Matt Daniels and I'm a journalist at the Pudding, which is a publication for visually led storytelling. Well, mainly Matt made them, I just sent him a bunch of emails. These charts are the result of a year long obsession I’ve had over a very specific trend I’ve noticed in music. Men singing really high. When I listen to the radio, I’ve come to expect one thing. Male pop stars exploiting their upper register. Bruno Mars, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Charlie Puth, Justin Bieber, Justin Timberlake, Adam Lavine, the Jonas Brothers, Ed Sheeran, Khalid, Childish Gambino, Frank Ocean, all of One Direction, BTS, Chris Martin, One Republic, and Sam Smith. I’m not the first person to pick up on this. In 2015 alone it seemed every guy was singing high. There was Jason Derulo “Just the thought of you, gets me so high (so high)” Maroon 5 “I’m right here, cause I need a little love a little sympathy” And Justin Bieber “Yeah, I know that I let you down Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?” But maybe this fact is best illustrated by this 10 week period on the Billboard Charts. When The Weekend battled for the top spot against Justin Bieber “And I know she'll be the death of me” “What do you mean?” And then Himself “I only call you when it's half past five” until finally his Michael Jackson inspired voice was was dethroned by Adele’s “Hello.” “Hello, It’s Me” Really the only way to know if this hypothesis holds up, though, is to crunch the numbers and quantify it. And that’s where Matt came in. It kind of fits a really good mold of the questions that I really like, where we have a cultural question about vocal ranges and usage of falsetto and music and there is no perfect data set for that. We wanted to make a chart that showed how prevalent the male falsetto was in pop music, not just in the last 5 years, but as far back as we could go. That meant looking at music streaming services. Every streaming platform tags the millions of songs in their respective libraries with metadata, but each one does it a little differently. For example, Spotify has over 35 millions songs in their library, but their metadata is algorithmically driven and pretty broad. Matt: some of it was around the tempo of music and how danceable it was or its somber or positive tone. Pandora, on the other hand has a smaller library, but they are committed to very specific data. In their case it wasn’t algorithmically driven. They were actually having humans review songs and say what its DNA, or what its genome was. The result is a library of 2 million songs with up to 450 individual identifying markers. So that was interesting to me because falsetto and vocal range, while could be determined by a computer, often lends itself to the human ear because there is some subjectivity to it. So, we asked Pandora if they had vocal data. They did. And they shared it with us. So do you actually have available the original dataset that we received? Oh yeah yeah I can. Should I just bring that up? It's forty two thousand rows. The first entry is by George P. Watson from 1911 He was a Yodeler. One hundred and eight years later and 42,948 rows down we have the iconic high voice of Thom Yorke. Sudden words We’ll get to exactly how these are scored in a bit, but damn that’s a lot of songs. So what we said was “OK this is great to see these forty three thousand songs but really we only care about songs that charted.” So we created a data set of the Billboard Hot 100, a 28,000 song list of the 100 most popular songs in the US every week since 1958. and we went back to Pandora. And said we only really want the falsetto data for these songs, and not only do we want the falsetto data, but we also need data about the register. And a few other important things, like the gender of the person singing. It’s not just a matter of like putting into their system and it spits out the falsetto data. We need to match the names of the songs and the artists names to whatever Pandora has. Wait. So you have to do that manually? We write fancy programs to guess that there's a match and confirm that there's a match. So with Matt’s fancy program we matched 20,075 songs. So the biggest gap in the data is actually the missing songs that aren't on streaming services, but were on the Billboard Hot 100 and did have very valid falsetto data behind them. So in 1958 we have data for 50% of the songs that charted. In 2018 we have data for 95% of the songs that charted. The good thing though is, you think of an average number one hit from 1958 - that's more likely to appear on Pandora than a song that hit number 100 for one week. When I first sat down with this giant spreadsheet, I immediately wanted to see how songs that I thought had a lot of falsetto had actually been scored. The first song that I looked for was Childish Gambino’s “Redbone.” “If you want it, you can have it, ohhhhhh” His voice is super high and very memorable. Not only that, a lot of articles about this song mentioned it had a lot of falsetto. To my astonishment, Pandora determined there was no falsetto in the song, instead they said it was just sung in a high register This trend was most stark in the hard rock and heavy metal genres. Def Leppard’s “Rock of Ages” had a falsetto score of zero but register score of 9 out of 10. I don't care if it takes all night I gonna set this town alight, come on Knowing this, let’s define what falsetto and vocal register actually are. To do that I’ve brought in an actual opera singer. Hi I'm Anthony Roth Costanzo and I'm a countertenor and opera singer. Prove it. Perfect, let’s talk about vocal range first. The voices starting from the bottom in the classical tradition are bass, baritone, tenor, contralto, countertenor, mezzo soprano, Soprano. Countertenor is kind of a catch all term and it's a range that goes up and down. Most male pop stars today are tenors. That means their average range is somewhere between here and here. Pandora’s data scores vocal register - which measures a singers ability to go up and down their range consistently. A super high register Pandora rates songs from 0-10 from low to high. “Rock of Ages” ranked super high with a 9 - Pharrell’s voice in “Get Lucky” was given an 8 “I’m up all night to get some, she’s up all night for good fun, I’m up all night to get lucky” As was Elton John in “Crocodile Rock” “I never knew me a better time and I guess I never will” So I think it's safe to say that between a 7 and 8 is pretty high on the vocal register range. But it's not crazy. So when these artists want to access even higher notes they’ll likely switch to their falsetto register. Falsetto is an Italian word which means “false little voice.” Falsetto is typically a technique ascribed to a male singer that switches from their chest voice to their head voice. Whenever you're going from chest voice - meaning the speaking register - to head voice, there's often a little break because there are two different sets of muscles handing off to each other, and that's how you yodel right. [demonstrates yodeling] And that's what yodeling is. George, you’re back! It’s not just Yodeling. It happens in pop all the time, though that transition is often more invisible. Notice how Freddie Mercury goes from his chest voice to falsetto when he says the word “decline” “A built-in remedy For Kruschev and Kennedy At anytime an invitation You can't decline” Okay so let me just pause for a second and say that “falsetto,” as a term, has been around forever, but its definition has changed and evolved. Many vocal coaches would say that falsetto is that breathy, light sound you heard from Freddie Mercury. And they say the generic term “head voice” should describe crisper, reinforced high notes. A perfect example of that is from this 90s classic. “I knew I loved you before I met you. I knew I loved you.” That's amazing. I mean you know that's like a really well integrated instrument. For your average music listener, aka me, the technical distinction between head voice and falsetto is less important than the fact that they both just sound impossibly high. That brings us again to the scoring system. A 10 on the Pandora scale is a song that’s sung entirely in Falsetto “Staying alive” That’s pretty extreme, and according to our data set, it’s also pretty rare. So here’s the tricky determination I’ve got to make. What falsetto score is enough to really define a song. I think a good place to start is a song literally called “Falsetto” “Now I got her talking like this, in a falsetto. She’s like oooh oooh baby ahh ah ah” Pandora gave this song a 6 - in their ears, The-Dream only used the technique moderately. This is where I could split hairs all day. Because while, yeah, The-Dream doesn’t use a falsetto the whole time, the technique plays does play a central role in the track. The hook of the song, the most memorable part, is sung in falsetto. Justin Timberlake’s “Cry Me A River” also got a 6. “Cry me a river (go on and just) Cry me a river (go on and just) Cry me a river (baby, go on and just)” So, I’m going to look at songs with a falsetto above a 5 If there’s one thing I can’t stress enough, it’s that this data can be addressed in a 1,000 different ways. To keep things simple, though we’ve separated falsetto and vocal register as two separate data points. I think this is probably the first chart I made that just was super simple and just said all right “What is the average value of all the songs that charted in a year.” First let's focus on vocal register. I was not expecting to see this just a very clear like march to the top in the late 80s The average vocal register for male singer in 1988 was a 7.1. But as you can see across any time period, that average never really dropped below 5.4. Because there were so many songs in 1988 that had a register of 7 or higher, we’re going to make this a little bit tougher. I’m going to boost the register to an 8 and only allow songs that made it in the top 10. We’ve got a strong hard rock and heavy metal showing. “She's got a smile it seems to me” There’s my man Phil Collins “I'm always right there beside her We're two hearts” I’ve literally never heard this song “I can rocket 2 u” Okay, wow. If we push the Falsetto score up to a 6, we’re left with just two songs from 1988. “Smooth Criminal” “He came into her apartment He left the bloodstains on the carpet” and “Nite and Day” by Al B Sure! “I can tell you how I feel about you night and day” With Nite and Day just barely edging out to win. The 1980s blew a high male vocal register out of the water. So let’s see how this chart changes when we just focus on falsetto. Things start to shift going back from the 1980s to the 1970s - the disco era. 1975 was the highest year for falsetto. Where 18% of songs had a value over 4. It also serves as a turning point for the Bee Gees. This might be surprising to hear, but before 1975 the Bee Gees’s average falsetto was around 0.8. After 1975 it rose to a 5.5. And that makes sense. They had to compete with the likes of Earth, Wind, and Fire, Ohio Players, Eddie Kendricks, Curtis Mayfield - all artists whose careers were defined by their high voices. I can imagine a record executive in a room listening to a song and they're like “Yeah that's great but you should put some falsetto in there somewhere” It wasn’t until 1976 that their now trademark falsetto hit number one. “You should be dancing, yeah” Looking back at both of these charts, it’s obvious something shifted after the 1980s. The thing that changed after the 80s is you have hip hop becoming massively popular. And today it's the most popular genre. If you look at the average song there just isn't as many opportunities for for a falsetto because there's just less singing. So how do we account for that? So I created this toggle that basically said is there singing in this song which is also from the Pandora data, they basically have a spoken variable. So first let’s see what happens when we toggle the singing function for songs in the top 10. 1996 and 2015 really shoot up. Let’s focus on 1996 first. This was the year Neo-Seoul went mainstream. Artists like D’Angelo and Maxwell led the charge. Their voices were a modern twist on the soul artists of the 1970s. I mean just listen to D’Angelo next to Curtis Mayfield. “When I first saw you baby I wanted to die Me and those dreamin' eyes of mine” “So In Love, every time we kiss” 2 1996 was a huge year for Falsetto, but so was 2015. And here are maybe your your your ears hearing the right thing, relative to other years, 2015 was the year of high voices. Regardless of which toggle we select or which combination of falsetto and register we choose, we did find this: if a song has falsetto, whether it’s a 1 or a 10, it’s going to chart higher — and longer. This is true across nearly every year. Not only that, Top 10 Hits are more likely to use falsetto. Take a look at that huge spike in 2015. 66% of songs that peaked in the top 10 had falsetto. Regardless of the decade, high male voices are iconic. From the Frankie Vallie belting Sherry “Sherry baby” To the 70s swagger of Bloodstone’s “Natural High” “I'm trying to make something out of nothing And I don't even know you” To the Weeknd’s hazy R&amp;B “None of these toys on lease too, ah Made your whole year in a week too, yah” It feels like today is very good for the commercial viability of the high male voice. And I think that's true if the window of time is the millennials' lifetime. But if you were to talk to your parents or your parents parents they'd be like Oh you think today is good. In nineteen seventy five it's not even comparable. The reason why it might feel like a trend today is because this is all we've ever known. "

190,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,qdjArlHB8k8,"ISIS just claimed a major new terror attack in the Belgian capital of Brussels to understand why they would do this, you have to look at something that changed for ISIS about a year ago and pretty far away in the middle east So ISIS in the summer of 2014 had had a huge sweep across the region, seizing lots of cities Starting in early 2015, the group began to suffer some real defeats in Syria and Iraq lost some major cities and started to come under attack from American airstrikes and in just a few months it lost a quarter of its territory but this posed more than just a military threat to ISIS It had always operated on a narrative of victory and invinsibility and it used that to recruit and motivate fighters of other Jihadist groups and it needs those fighters to survive the was caliphate was losing ground so it was losing that narrative and it needed something new to keep that going so first they tried to expand abroad, Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen but those efforts all fizzled, in the summer and fall of 2015 ISIS found its solution, by launching mass terror attacks against civilians abroad and this helped the group portray itself once again as on the march but then Europe faced a big problem in how to deal with these attacks because the hard truth is that most of these attackers aren't foreigners. They aren't refugees or migrants they're actually European nationals and you can't just close the border to keep them out if they're actually from Europe and a lot of them are people who went and joined ISIS or other terrorist groups, so-called foreign fighters and now that ISIS is losing territory, those fighters are coming home, and they're bringing their battled hardened experience and skills with them and these are really hard problems to solve, rooted in socio-economic problems grievances that go pretty deep in European society you can't solve this with bombs or with border closings So what now? It seems likely that as ISIS keeps losing its territory its going to become something like what it was before, when America was fighting the Iraq war in the mid 2000's Not a state, but still an insurgency and a terrorist group capable of doing terrible damage abroad.

191,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,rCT-UL2M8Gc,"In September of 2008, something unheard of happened in the art world. A British artist, Damien Hirst, took 223 pieces of his new work to Sotheby’s auction house and sold every single piece. I’ll start the bidding here at £2,500,000. It was a 2 day event, and the total sale was about $200 million. It broke the record for single artist auction of $20 million back in 1993. Hirst’s work&nbsp;included things like this zebra, this unicorn, and this painting made from butterflies. So how did he –&nbsp;how do artists&nbsp;– do this? Well for the most part, the artists aren't the ones behind it. Okay, so obviously money isn’t the only value that defines a work of art, and&nbsp;who knows how history will remember this unicorn. But order to sell a million-dollar artwork, you need strong market value– and you need extremely high demand. And a ton of work goes into creating that. As Don Thompson describes in his book, the formula for art pricing goes something like this. The bigger the work, generally the more expensive it is. But, the biggest variable is the reputation of the artist. Sometimes you’re world-famous, and sometimes you’re not. What? But when a new artist steps into the art market, the reputation of the artist heavily relies on the name of the dealer. This shark by Damien Hirst is a good example. Hirst first began working with an art industry giant, Charles Saatchi, in the 1990s. Saatchi commissioned Hirst to make anything he wanted for £50,000 after seeing this cow’s head at a show shortly after Hirst’s graduation in 1990. Hirst bought a shark for £6000 from an Australian fisherman and created this, injecting it with tons of formaldehyde. Later in 2004, it was sold for $12 million to a billionaire hedge fund manager, Steve Cohen. It was roughly 130 times the original price but it makes sense considering Saatchi’s reputation. And it makes more sense when you think about how it was bought –&nbsp;dealers can use selective information to get potential buyers to pay more. Hirst’s huge auction I mentioned before… For dealer-sold work, everything is private, including the prices, which gives dealers the upper hand in pricing. In 1988, New York City tried to ban this by reinforcing the Truth in Pricing law, and galleries fought back HARD, paying fines and protesting saying that showing prices will be “getting in the way of the enjoyment of the exhibition.” By keeping the price private, art dealers can rely more on their reputation to make the artwork feel more valuable to the buyer. Outside this equation, the basic laws of economics also apply. The next step of operations for the dealer is creating scarcity. In 1999, when Jenny Saville, a new emerging British artist became affiliated with Charles Saatchi, he convinced her to cut her work down to only 6 paintings per year. He sold them for $100,000 each. So what does this all result to? According to Artnet, the estimated size of the art market was $64 billion in 2015. And&nbsp;market is growing outside of traditional sales of galleries and auction houses. This chart shows the art world might be learning the lesson Saatchi taught Jenny Savile –the total value of the art that’s being sold is growing faster than the number of pieces. Sell less of it, for more. But to sell that million-dollar artwork, you’ll need reputation bigger than Hirst’s, or Charles Saatchi’s. The dealer model still dominates the fine art world, but for the rest of us, selling art online has never been easier. The prices are open and it’s accessible for a broad group of people. And for one thing, now you know where to start: think big. "
192,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,rFxu7NEoKC8,"Your body is a temple, but it’s also a museum of natural history. Look closely and you’ll see parts that aren’t there because you need them but because your animal ancestors did. No longer serving their previous function but not costly enough to have disappeared, these remnants of our deep history only make sense within the framework of evolution by natural selection. With your arm on a flat surface, push your thumb against your pinky and tip your hand slightly up. If you see a raised band in the middle of the wrist, you’ve got a vestigial muscle in your forearm. That tendon you see connects to the palmaris longus, a muscle that around 10-15% of people are missing on one or both of their arms. It doesn’t make them any weaker though. There’s no difference in grip strength. In fact, it’s one of the first tendons that surgeons will take out so they can use it in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries. You can find the palmaris longus across mammal species, but it’s most developed among those that use their forelimbs to move around. In primates, that means the muscle is longer in lemurs and monkeys and shorter in chimps, gorillas, and other apes that don’t do a lot of scrambling through trees. It’s not the only leftover muscle that we've got. Look at the three that are attached to our outer ear. We can’t get much movement out of these muscles, especially compared to some of our mammal relatives who use them to locate the sources of sounds. Presumably this would have been quite helpful for early nocturnal mammals. In humans, you can still detect the remnants of this adaptation with electrodes. In one study researchers recorded a spike of activity in the ear muscle cells in response to a sudden sound. Not enough to move the ear, but detectable. And you can probably guess the location of the sound based on the results - it came from a speaker to the left of the study subjects. So this is their left ear subconsciously trying (and failing) to pivot toward the sound. You can see another futile effort by our vestigial body parts when you get goosebumps. When we’re cold, tiny muscles attached to our body hairs contract, pulling the hair upright which causes the surrounding skin to form a bump. For our furry mammal relatives, the raised hair increases the amount of space for insulation, helping them stay warm. Birds can do this too. you’ve probably seen a puffy pigeon on a cold day. Adrenaline is one of the hormones involved in the body’s response to cold temperatures, and it’s also part of the fight or flight response. So it helps some animals appear larger when they’re threatened. And it may be why surprising and emotional turns in music can give some people goosebumps. And then there’s our tail. At the end of our spine are a set of fused vertebrae - some people have 3, some have 5. We call it the tailbone. It now serves as an anchor for some pelvic muscles but it’s also what’s left of our ancestors’ tails. Every one of us actually had a tail at one point. When the basic body plan is being laid out at around 4 weeks of gestation, humans embryos closely resemble embryos of other vertebrates. And that includes a tail with 10-12 developing vertebrae. In many other animals it continues to develop into a proper tail. But in humans and other apes, the cells in the tail are programmed to die a few weeks after they appear. Vary rarely though, a mutation allows the ancestral blueprint to prevail and a human baby will be born with a true vestigial tail. The most adorable vestigial behavior is the palmar grasp reflex, where infants up until they’re about 6 months old have this incredible grasp on whatever you put in their hand. There’s a similar reflex for their feet. I wanted to show you this great piece of footage from the 1930s where they demonstrated this behavior. These babies are only 1 month old and you can see that their inner monkey can support their entire weight. "
193,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,rwAyoX8D3YE,"This is James Thompson. And this is James Owens. They were both convicted in connection with the same burglary, rape, and murder case. As you might expect the people on Malvern Street are shocked and horrified by the crime. Colleen's brother and a friend discovered the body last night. But nearly 20 years later DNA evidence from the scene was tested and the results showed neither of the men could have committed the rape. James Owens walked out of prison a fully exonerated man, but James Thompson he's still labeled a convicted felon. Same crime, same DNA results, very different endings. To figure out why, we have to start at the beginning with a knife, a lie, and a plea bargain that altered their lives. It began with the murder of Colleen Wilier in 1987. Thompson, a gas station attendant lived down the street with his wife and their two young boys. There were helicopters and things flying around the neighborhood, searching the top of the building and things looking for murder weapons, bloody clothes, anything of that nature that could be linked to the crime. He'd heard detectives were looking for a knife and were offering a one thousand dollar reward. And I jumped on the first chance I could get to take that. So I goes back in the house and you know I was stupid I guess you'd say, but I went into the bedroom and I got a switchblade knife. And I took the knife out and this was the beginning of my whole situation. Thompson told the police he found the knife in the grass about half a block from the crime scene. They said to me, they said well do you have any idea who this knife belong to? I said the knife was stolen out of my house they said uh you have any idea who took this knife at your home? And I told a lie and I said yes, I do. And I give them the name of a man, his name was James Owens. He and Owens were casual friends, until they had a falling out over accusations of theft. In a burst of vengeance, Thompson implicated Owens. His bogus testimony and that knife became the crux of the entire case. They described it as a mint green dagger an instrument repeatedly used by the person who murdered the 24-year old woman. So at this point and that's all city police have to go on, an unusual murder weapon which they hope leads them to the murderer. James Owens was arrested for the crime. They never did look for any other suspects. But they wasn't happy with the things I was telling them. Thompson's version of the events changed multiple times throughout Owens' trial. He started to look like an unreliable witness. Even the prosecutor admitted his story was ""implausible"". Worried that they might lose their case against Owens, the detectives found a new focus. A couple months after the crime actually was committed, one of the detectives said wait a minute, Mr. Thompson seemed to know too much to not have been involved in the crime himself. They took a sample of Thompson's hair and tested it against a hair found on the victim. It came back a match. The hair analysis method used would later become known as junk science, but at the time it was enough for the detectives to pin down a theory that both Owens and Thompson were involved in the crime. In what was his eighth version of events, Thompson eventually gave a false confession. I testified to exactly what they wanted me to testify to, I said exactly what I was instructed to say. The state convicted Owens for the burglary and murder and Thompson for the burglary, rape, and murder. They were both sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The only thing that could feasibly save them was the emergence of DNA science. Owens first heard about DNA in prison. He saw his friend and fellow inmate Kirk Bloodsworth, become the first American man on death row to be exonerated by DNA testing. And then, the OJ Simpson case popularized the science. The answer will be clear to you as well. I said to myself, wow I wonder if I had any in mine. So a couple my friends in prison that was jailhouse lawyers, helped me. We wrote letters to the coroner's office and it came back there was DNA. Owens was asking for it to be tested ever since he had been wrongfully convicted and had become aware that there was such a thing as DNA testing. But no one would test it. Lawyer Stephen Mercer, who represented both Owens and Thompson in their individual cases, pushed for the DNA testing of two samples. One slide contained sperm taken from the victim. Also tested was the blood that was on James Thompson's shorts, that police collected the day after Colleen Wilier's body was found. I couldn't sleep like two days, three days, I said man, I said I might be going home. And there it was. The DNA came back, said it wasn't mine. The results showed the sperm sample didn't match either of the men. And the blood on Thompson's shorts was his own. Owens was granted a new trial. It would likely be months or even years away. The state offered him a chance to go free immediately, if he did one thing: take an obscure deal called an Alford plea. Plea bargains aren't surprising. They're the lifeblood of an overburdened criminal justice system, where 95% of cases are resolved through plea agreements. But the Alford Plea is unique. It began with North Carolina versus Alford in 1970, when a man named Henry Alford was charged first degree murder. The state offered Alford a deal. If he pled guilty to second-degree murder, he wouldn't be sentenced to die. Alford took it, but in court he insisted that he was innocent and he was only pleading guilty to avoid death. The Supreme Court held that someone who insists that they are innocent on the record, can still plead guilty to a crime and accept the status of a convicted felon. The deal also allows prosecutors to keep a win on the books and admit no wrongdoing. To this day, 47 states and the District of Columbia allow the plead. For Owens, who was imprisoned for over 20 years, the Alford plea offered immediate freedom, but at the cost of living with a label of a murderer. I look at it like this: why would I go into court and plead guilty to something I didn't have nothing to do with? I was in prison for 21 years. I'm not taking no Alford plea. He took a chance with the trial, when his day in court came 16 months later, the state dismissed his case. It was the best feeling in my whole entire life. Just to get out of jail. And he walked out of that prison with a garbage bag over his shoulder, with all of his worldly possessions, but more important than what was in that bag, was that his principles were intact, because he insisted on his day in court. When confronted with that, the state folded. But for Thompson, things moved much slower. He was still waiting to secure a new trial. In that uncertainty, the state came forward and offered him an Alford plea. It was his ticket out. I was tired being in prison I wanted to go home. And the deal sounded real good at that point, I mean it was like the man was offering me a chance at life again, so I took it. I was released that day, February the 28th 2010, but I didn't know that by taking the Alford plea, that it would still mean that I was guilty. I would still have that on my record for the rest of my life and then there would be nothing I could ever do in regard to my false imprisonment. The lives of Thompson and Owens are case studies in what happens when you take a plea or wait for exoneration. Owens has a steady job with his cousin's company installing gutters. In his spare time he takes care of his cousin's kids. I'm 52 years old. Is it right for me to have kids now? No, because I shouldn't be 70 years old when my daughter graduated from high school. You know? I did 21 years. There was nobody can ever give me that back. Nobody. Not a judge or a jury can give me back the time that I lost. And I feel that I should be compensated for what I went through. He's now suing three detectives for the mishandling of his case and the time he's lost. If I could get a settlement I would probably take $100,000, $200,000. Put it into an account where I can help inmates, other inmates that were in the prison system and they were saying I'm innocent. You know I would pay for the DNA. Just to get this person out of jail, just to prove to the state of Maryland look you're wrong. Then, there's Thompson who lives with the stigma of being a convicted felon and is unable to sue the state for false imprisonment. Need one worker unload box. Box fielders in Salisbury at 6:00 a.m. What I do, I text them back I say this is James I will do it. Right now the only jobs I can get are through a temp agency, because every time I fill out a job application, the first question on have you ever been convicted of a felony? Yes I have been convicted of a felony. I mean it's it's hard. I'd like to have a good permanent job you know, where I could get 40 hours a week. No one will hire me because of my record. Society does not believe that innocent people go to prison. When I went to prison I had two boys, I have not seen either one of them since they were small children and I missed out on having the opportunity to be a father to them and raise them and things. And I've really missed that because now you know I won't ever have the opportunity to be a dad again. Thompson and Owens' lives diverged but are still connected through the same case, a crime that won't be reinvestigated. To this day they have an unsolved murder. They don't feel that way because, they convicted me. The whole case was revolved around me and Mr. Owens and was closed at that point. I'd like to have the opportunity to be able to sit down and apologize to him for what I did and for you know the amount of time of his life that I actually feel that I took from him. I can never give that back, no more than I can give back the 20-some years on my own life, but I think I would feel a little bit better in the heart, just to be able to to say I'm sorry . I mean, for whatever it's worth. Hey guys thanks for watching! Since these cases, one of the prosecutors has died and another prosecutor involved in Thompson's case wouldn't talk to ProPublica about why she thought the Alford plea was a fair bargain. ProPublica has been reporting on cases like these for over a year, but it's especially difficult since no one tracks how often the wrongfully convicted are pressured into accepting an Alford plea instead of being exonerated. For more reporting on cases like these, check out the link below and stay tuned for more in this collaboration. Thanks. "
194,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,sOow2__jSlY,"Consider the squirrel. Squirrels are everywhere and they're pretty cute, but are they valuable? Not really right? Believe it or not, medieval Europeans used to use red squirrel pelts as currency, just as you and I might exchange dollar bills today. It's one of the many surprisingly different ways humans have transacted with one another throughout history. It might seem crazy, but when you think about how we're now able to pay each other digitally in minutes cash might be going away the red squirrel sooner than you think. The history of money is a movement from trading stuff you can use, to trading stuff that's symbolic and now even virtual. Nowadays, you can send money safely and easily to pretty much anyone you know in a matter of minutes, straight from your personal banking app. So how did we get here? Somewhere in the middle of this history is the red squirrel or Sciurus Vulgaris, which formed the basis for the medieval economy of Finland and Russia. In fact the Finnish word for money, ""raha"" comes from squirrels. But they also became a symbol, a collective belief, a currency. A tikkuri  was 10 squirrel pelts and a kiihetelys was four times that and while values changed, at one point a hundred pelts could get you a whole cow. But, big drawback: it took time to catch them and while squirrel currency eventually went out of favour as metal coins appeared, there were still squirrel pelt currency exchange charts even in 1926. Despite what the internet might tell you though and we asked the Finnish Embassy about this and they laughed at us. Squirrels are no longer accepted as payment their, FYI. A squirrel economy is pretty weird, but humans everywhere have a history of paying with strange things. Things that are really just symbols we believed to be worth something. These cowry shells spread across much of the ancient trading lands, from China to India, to Eastern Africa. Salt or Salarium Argentum, was paid out to soldiers in Rome and it's the reason you now get a salary by the way. In Central America the cocoa bean understandably became prized. Even in modern Italy and this is true, 17,000 tons of Parmesan Reggiano cheese are kept bank vaults as collateral. Besides the squirrel, the strangest / most symbolic / most unwieldy was the rai stone, of the Solomon Islands. It had to be gathered from islands hundreds of miles away and they were so huge that they occasionally capsized canoes. Of course it's tempting to laugh at our ancestors for paying with such weird things, but we're not really all that different. For centuries for us in the United States, gold was the standard currency and some still obsess over it, but it's really just a symbol too - not that far removed from a pelt. And the same is basically true with paper money. It's important, but ultimately works as a representation of a country's stability, like melting gold or hauling huge limestone tablets across oceans or catching 40 squirrels, cash takes time. A study suggests that Americans waste 200 billion dollars worth of our time per year just getting it out of ATMs, so where does that leave us? Today we continue to go even faster and more symbolic in an era where you can just send money in minutes from your bank account to a friend's bank account on your phone. Paper money may soon seem just as silly as paying with a squirrel, so the more transfers, the more money available in your bank account within minutes and less fur. The red squirrel would probably be happy. "
195,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,sd58w0CXQrM,"The dream of the pneumatic tube will never die. They’re a few quirks from mainstream — an oddity at bank drive thrus, a retro vision of a smokeless and frictionless future. But the hope lives with inventions like the Hyperloop that try to combine pneumatic tubes and maglev for high speed transport, The thing most people don’t know is how long the dream has been alive — and that they’ve been trying to move people for more than 150 years. Pneumatic tubes are pretty simple. At their most basic, a sealed tube allows a fan to make a vacuum. When a canister pops into place, a fan whirs to life and creates a difference in air pressure that sucks the tube to its destination. As early as the 1850s, people adapted artificial vacuums for powering the mail system, and they sent lots of packages — including cats. Part II The New York City underground pneumatic mail system launched in 1897. It carried the mail from one post office to another. The first cannister had a Bible, a flag, and a copy of the Constitution. As an inside joke, the second carried an imitation peach. The third had a black cat (it survived). Operators called themselves “Rocketeers” and at its peak the system could send 200,000 letters an hour. It wasn’t close to the first. Pneumatic mail systems were surprisingly common. They’d been running in London since the 1850s, and were in Paris, Prague, Philadelphia, and tons of other places. But as cities spread out and automobiles developed, tubes became too difficult to install, maintain, and staff. They saw more widespread adoption in department stores, offices, and yes, banks. NASA used tubes for memos. As interoffice mail, tubes were more practical, until smaller offices and email made them an extravagance there, too. But the dream was always bigger than that. They wanted to put people in the canisters. Part III Before the mail was the pneumatic railway, including New York’s first subway system, 30 years before construction of today’s familiar underground subway began. Opened in 1870, Alfred Ely Beach’s experimental subway debuted under Broadway, modeled on experiments in England. It sold more than 400,000 short rides as just an experiment: for New Yorkers of the era, it wasn’t a subway — It was an advance in civilization. Like London’s Crystal Palace atmospheric roadway in the 1860s, it promised easy, clean, transport. But Beach’s proof of concept closed before more stations could be built. Investors got scared. There was no pneumatic disaster, just reality. The same thing that eventually took down the mail took down the pneumatic subway. It wasn’t easy or cheap enough to be sustainable. The airless tube had too much friction. Pneumatic tubes are still around. Until 2011, they were used in at least one McDonald’s drive-thru. And they’re still used in hospitals to transport lab samples quickly and safely from one floor to another. But it’s the Hyperloop that has the original spirit, the conviction that the pneumatic tube isn’t a pipe dream. It’s the idea part Victorian, part Jetsons: that tubes won’t just push people from one place to another, But maybe into the future, too. Any history of pneumatic tubes is going to involve a lot of omissions. I had to leave out the trash disposal on Roosevelt Island, pneumatic dating, and also the pioneering pneumatic mail in Philadelphia, where they sent a rooster, guinea pigs, and a goldfish in a goldfish bowl through the pneumatic — and none of them were injured.

196,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,tNla9nyRMmQ,"I cannot tell you how obsessed I am with this chart. It shows exactly what is wrong with America's conversation about health care. On one level, you've seen this chart before. It shows health care spending as a share of the economy of a bunch of countries. There's Germany and France and Japan and Canada and oh! There's America. But now I want to add something you haven't seen to this chart. This is how much of that spending in each country is private and how much is public. Here's what's amazing: America's government spending on health care on programs like Medicaid and Medicare and the VA - our versions of socialized medicine. It's about the same size as these other countries. These countries where the government runs the whole health care system! And then there's our private spending. It's the private insurance system that makes health care in America so expensive. Conventional wisdom says that the government is more expensive than the private sector. ""It can't say no. It's corrupt, it's inefficient, it's slow."" ""If you want something done right you give it to the private sector."" That is what we hear in America all the time. And yet here we are with the biggest  private sector spending the most. If you look at the data on physician visits and hospital discharges, you can get rid of one theory. Americans don't consume more health care than people in these other countries. We don't go to the doctor more than the Germans or the Japanese. In fact we go to the doctor less. The difference between us and them is that we pay more. Every time we go to the doctor for everything from an angioplasty to a hip replacement from a c-section to a pain reliever. In America, the price for the same procedure at the same hospital, it varies enormously depending on who is footing the bill. The price for someone with public insurance like Medicare or Medicaid is often the lowest price. These groups he covers so many people that the government can demand lower prices from hospitals and doctors and they get those lower prices. If the doctors and hospitals say 'No' they lose a ton of business. They lose all those people on Medicare all those people on Medicaid. But there are hundreds of private insurance companies And they each cover far fewer people than a Medicare or a Medicaid. And each one has to negotiate prices and hospitals and doctors are on their own. And if you're uninsured, you have even less leverage. Nobody is negotiating on your behalf. So you end up paying the highest price. One study found that most hospitals charge uninsured patients four times as much as Medicare patients for an ER visit. Other countries, they don't have this problem. Instead of every private insurance company negotiating with every healthcare provider. There's just this big list. The country, the central government, they go and they say, ""If you want to sell to us, to all of our people, then here's what you can charge for a checkup. Here is what you can charge for an MRI or a prescription for Lipitor. And so then whether that bill goes to the heavily regulated private insurance companies in Germany or directly to the government like in the UK. Each country is telling the doctor or hospital or drug company how much that bill will be. And because the government controls access to all of the customers. It's an offer that hospitals and doctors and pharmaceutical companies typically can't refuse. ""I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse."" In America the idea is that you'll be a consumer. That you'll do what you do when you go to  Best Buy and buy a television. But that just doesn't work in healthcare. It doesn't work in healthcare because you often come and get health care when you're unconscious, in an ambulance, when you're scared, when it's for your spouse or your child It is a time when you have the least bargaining power. You are not usually capable of saying, 'No.' You're not knowledgeable enough to do it, you're not comfortable doing it, or you're not conscious enough to do it. That's why in other countries the government is a person who can say 'No' for you. You can say, 'No, that's too expensive you're going to have to lower your price' because they do have that power. Anchor: A new push for single-payer health care right here in the US. Demonstrator: What do we want? Crowd: Single-payer! Demonstrator: When do we want it? Crowd: Now! Anchor: California and others are saying maybe we should adopt the European model. Klein: If we decided to create a single-payer system with one of these huge price lists in the US There would be nothing to stop lobbying from hospitals from doctors from drug companies. And those prices would get influenced. So we could end up with a single-payer system that is expensive. Even as expensive as our current system. It all depends on how much you negotiate down the prices and now in America these groups have so much power because they are so rich. That it's really hard to get them to bring down the prices. This is the irony of American healthcare: It's so expensive that it's become hard to make it cheaper. All that money they make, that becomes political power. And years and years and years of overpaying - those are huge industries now. And they have a lot of influence in Congress. Under a single-payer system if we did drive prices down, doctors and hospitals they would be paid less than they are right now. That might mean some of them close or some go out of business or some move. It would be really painful. One person's waste is another person's essential service or local hospital or their income. But then single-payer it's not an all-or-nothing choice. For instance, there's a really interesting section of Bernie Sanders Medicare-for-all bill. Where he lays out this interim plan. It's a plan he wants while he's setting up his new single-payer system. And in that plan, he expands Medicare to cover vision and dental. And he opens it to nearly everyone. Not just people 65 and older. All kids go on Medicare automatically and most adults can buy in. That plan, on its own, it wouldn't get American health care spending far down overnight. But it would at least begin to recognize what we already know and what most other countries already do: That health care is one of those things the government can do cheaper and better than the private sector.

197,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,tWcV94G4rRI,"This is the US Coast Guard intercepting a shipment of cocaine. Here's the same crew intercepting another one... and another one. This was all in the summer of 2018. They seized more than 9,000 kilos of cocaine that was headed to the US. That may sound like a lot but it's just the tip of the iceberg. In 2017 the Coast Guard intercepted almost 227,000 kilos of cocaine, here. Along the eastern Pacific. That's because the US is the largest cocaine consumer in the world. And to get to the US, most of that cocaine has to travel this way, through Central America and Mexico. With that comes violence and today Guatemala and Honduras are some of the most violent places in the world. It's a big reason why so many people are traveling north to seek asylum at the US-Mexico border. But the story of Central America's crisis isn't just about America's demand for drugs. Another big part of it...is America's war on drugs. Cocaine is produced in South America along the Andes mountain range that stretches from Bolivia to Colombia. Starting in the mid 1970s most of the world's cocaine came from here; distributed by groups like the Medellin Cartel led by Pablo Escobar. But they needed to get their product, here, to the US. Where by the late 80s Americans were spending tens of billions of dollars on cocaine annually. And they did it this way: Cartels sent boats and planes loaded with cocaine through the Caribbean to South Florida. For example Escobar's cartel primarily flew cocaine from Medellin to the Bahamas and then over to Miami. ""Miami is one of the principal branch offices for what can be called cocaine Inc. It's got to be four or five times as much cocaine as we've ever seen before... The drug has killed at least 34 people just in South Florida so far this year."" So the US cracked down on the Caribbean route. ""To stop those drugs on the way to America I propose that we Spend more than a billion and a half dollars on interdiction. They started catching shipments along the coast line. Like this speedboat called a go-fast boat that was intercepted by the Coast Guard. And they worked with the Colombian government to destroy coca and fight the cartels in Colombia. The Caribbean route was dismantled but the cocaine industry kept going. Cartels just needed a new route to the US, and they found it in Mexico. Mexican cartels already had ways to get drugs over their border and into the u.s. So, Colombian cartels shipped their cocaine to Mexico but their boats and planes had to stop somewhere along the way to avoid detection and to refuel. And the ideal place to stop was Central America, especially Honduras and Guatemala. Not only were these countries directly south of Mexico,  but they had just been through decades of civil wars and foreign interventions. Their governments were weak and easily bought off and criminal organizations had power. It was an easy place for the cartels to turn to. Back in Mexico, the new cocaine routes turned lucrative, fast. The Mexican cartels got bigger and more powerful and started controlling more territory. And the government responded... ""It's a war! 10,000 federal troops and police to Juarez. Mexico cracked down with the help of the US. ""He will not allow his country to be taken over by narco traffickers"" This crackdown was largely a failure. It caused chaos and violence spiked. But it did make it more difficult to send cocaine directly to Mexico. So cartels started shipping cocaine to Central America, to landing points along the coasts, and would move it into Mexico overland. Central America wasn't just a stop along the way anymore. Suddenly it found itself at the center of cocaine trafficking. And all the things that made Central American countries ideal as refueling stops made them vulnerable to the violence that comes with drug routes. Criminal organizations, already powerful in their countries, started forming alliances with Mexican cartels. In Guatemala, this group aligned with the Zetas while these went with the rival Sinaloa cartel. Violence surged here: along the northern Honduran coast where cocaine shipments arrived and at the border where the cocaine is transported north by land. With violence on the rise it was now Central America's turn to crackdown throughout the region... Governments embraced harsh policies to combat not just drug traffickers but all organized crime. A policy, backed again, by the US: ""To find ways in which we can come up with more aggressive action plans to improve security. We have a shared responsibility when it comes to dealing with drug trafficking."" Newly militarized police forces arrested thousands, prisons filled up, but the violence didn't stop. And that's where we are today. Honduras and Guatemala have violent death rates on par with active war zones. And thousands of migrants are taking dangerous routes through Mexico to the US to escape the instability and violence. For decades the US has tried to stop drugs from coming in but it's only really succeeded in changing how those drugs come in. And Central America might be the place that's feeling those changes the hardest. Hey if you've made it this far in the video you're probably the kind of curious person that appreciates learning.

198,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,tfREC-AkX20,"[Joss Fong] Your body is a temple… but mine is also an underfunded museum of natural history. It shuts down at noon, because I didn’t get enough sleep from the night before. It turns out I’m not alone in this. “This is hard to hear, but no shocker really...” “The Center for Disease Control says insufficient sleep is public health epidemic…” “More than a third of Americans aren’t getting enough sleep...” The recommended amount of sleep varies by age, with newborns needing the most, and adults needing at least seven hours. But, while over 60% of Americans are getting enough restful sleep, there is a striking disparity when you look at race. Only a little over half of black Americans reported getting 7 hours or more of sleep. Sleep is essential to health. Everyone has to do it. What does a good night’s sleep look like? A good night’s sleep is spending at least 85% of the time sleeping in the bed — like on an actual bed, not on the floor, not on the couch, not underneath someone’s desk, sorry Sam — falling asleep in 30 minutes or under, waking up only once per night, and if you do wake up it’s for less than 20 minutes. And don’t forget the recommended 7 hours or more of sleep. Bad sleep is spending less than 74% of sleeping time in bed, taking more than an hour to fall asleep, waking up numerous times throughout the night, and if you do wake up it’s for 41 minutes or more during the night. Getting too little or bad sleep can have negative effects. There is a suspicion that disparities in sleep are also contributing to disparities in other areas in health, like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and maybe even early death. All these health risks and conditions disproportionately affect black Americans, who are five times more likely to get short sleep. Researchers point to stress caused by discrimination as one strong possibility. Since 2000, over 700 published studies have established a connection between discrimination and physical and mental wellness. In one study, scientists found that the more discrimination a person felt, the less deep sleep they experienced. The black participants of this study perceived more discrimination and slept more in light sleep and less in deep sleep. Poor sleep quality is also strongly associated with how much money you make. Black americans are more likely to live in poverty compared to white americans. It's a function of economics. It shows people who are working shifts probably won’t get the best sleep compared to folks who have a consistent schedule. [Lauren Hale} Generally, people who have more opportunities, more control over their lives, are also better sleepers. There’s a connection between neighborhood quality and sleep quality too. Poor communities are faced with higher pollution, elevated noise levels, crime, greater population density, and sometimes limited access to air-conditioning. Even if black families are middle-income, they’re more likely to live in poorer neighborhoods, which means these environmental factors could still influence their sleep. All of these things — the environment, the economy, stress — can compound on existing health conditions. A consistent finding is that when we see sleep disruptions, we also start seeing signs of insulin resistance— which is a precursor to diabetes. You start to see signs of increased appetite. You start to see signs that people aren't regulating their metabolism so well. Long-term stress can lead to chronic elevated cortisol levels — which suppress the immune system, increase blood pressure, contribute to obesity, and more. Obesity — which affects almost half of all black adults in the US — contributes to other serious sleep conditions like sleep apnea. A disorder where breathing is interrupted during sleep. And sleep apnea increase the risk for stroke and heart attack. Bad sleep can even change your DNA. Every single cell of your body has a clock that cycles that turns on and off throughout the day. All these clocks are producing feedback loops, so when you disrupt the big clock in your brain, you're probably going to disrupt these little clocks throughout your body. Even modest sleep loss can trigger the immune system's inflammatory response to disease and injury. It all becomes a vicious cycle leading to worsening health conditions. Having enough good sleep is a big deal. But just telling people to ""get more sleep"" probably isn’t that effective. Fixing the sleep gap means handling it at both the individual level and policy level. Having accessible and affordable public transportation, and housing near jobs would help workers spend less time commuting and more time sleeping. Employers could use sleep wellness programs to incentivize workers to catch up on their Z’s though a government mandate would make this more widespread. Even some researchers are using community outreach to guide neighborhoods to better sleep. Then there are steps people can take for more restful sleep. It seems pretty clear that there's a correlation between bad sleep and poor health outcomes. It still not know if you give people better sleep, if those health outcomes will then improve. And this research is still ongoing, so this is going to be a really key thing to know, that if we can improve people’s sleep, we may be able to make them healthier. And maybe tackling other inequalities in the US would be more of a reality and less of a dream. "
199,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,uMXumMJZYYI,"This is Comperj. The biggest petrochemical complex in Brazil. It’s located in Itaboraí, a small city in the state of Rio de Janeiro. The multibillion dollar project launched in 2008 and the plan was to open in 2011. Thousands of Brazilians moved there to work. But it’s 2018, and Comperj never opened. Construction of the complex stopped in 2015, after it became a symbol of the largest corruption scandal in Brazil’s history -- Operation Car Wash. Hundreds of prominent Brazilians including CEOs, members of Congress and even a former President have been implicated. Some of Brazil’s largest companies lost billions of dollars and the country slid further into recession. Four years since it broke, the scandal is still rippling through Brazil, leaving places like Itaboraí devastated in its wake. Itaboraí was the perfect place for one of Brazil’s most ambitious energy projects. It had the space for 2 refineries and a petrochemical plant - spanning 45 square kilometers. It’s also close to Brazil’s newly discovered natural gas fields off the coast of Rio and Sao Paulo. When the project launched, it was estimated that Comperj would generate 200,000 direct and indirect jobs in the area. Itaboraí became a boomtown. In 2010, 50,000 people moved there, 160 new businesses opened, and Itaboraí’s population grew by over 16%. But 1,200 kilometers away, police broke a case that would doom Comperj. In 2012, they had this gas station, in Brasilia, under surveillance. They suspected it was being used to launder money. Criminals would bring in illegal cash, report it as gas station earnings, and then funnel the cash to someone else - making the money hard to trace back. The police arrested a known money-launderer, Alberto Youssef, and offered him a plea deal in exchange for the source of the money. But he warned his lawyers: “If I speak, the Republic is going to fall”. Youssef testified that he was laundering money, not for criminals, but for top executives at Petrobras, Brazil’s state-owned oil company. Petrobras was the largest oil company in Latin America. It also owned Comperj. The police launched a massive investigation -- Operation Car Wash -- and soon discovered Petrobras was at the center of an intricate corruption scheme. The company used its projects to enrich criminals, engineering companies, and Brazilian government officials. Here’s how it worked in the Comperj project: When Petrobras needed to build the complex, it started a bidding process for the job. Typically, engineering firms would compete for the contract, driving down the price for Petrobras. But a group of these companies got together and formed an agreement. Instead of competing against each other, they cooperated to fix prices and take turns accepting projects. Odebrecht, the biggest firm and ring leader of this cartel, won some of the major contracts to build Comperj. This allowed Odebrecht to overcharge Petrobras, and profit immensely. The original cost for Comperj was about $6 billion. By 2015 Petrobras has paid at least $14 billion. Odebrecht then money laundered some of its profits through outside businesses, like the gas station before paying bribes to Petrobras executives and politicians. Petrobras executives would take the bribes as incentive to keep giving contracts exclusively to the cartel. Politicians took the bribes in exchange for their influence over Petrobras. Like Rio de Janeiro’s state governor, Sergio Cabral, who received more than $800,000 to give Comperj contracts to a firm in the cartel. This also became an important funding source for their reelection campaigns. ""Brazil's Petrobras, one of the world's biggest oil companies in a heap of trouble."" ""The company's in the midst of an escalating corruption scandal."" After the scandal broke, Petrobras and the engineering companies were in trouble. Over two dozen executives were initially arrested. Compounded by falling oil prices, Petrobras lost half its stock value between September 2014 and January 2015 Construction on Comperj was incomplete when 13,000 workers were laid off. Today, in Itaborai, 40,000 people are signed up for the city's employment program. An average of 250 people line up here in search of odd jobs. Many of these unemployed residents used to work at Comperj. The massive layoffs at Comperj, affected the rest of the city as well. With Brazil's economy still trying to recover from a recession, Itaborai has found it hard to bounce back on its own. Today, some limited construction is planned to resume at Comperj after Chinese and Brazilian firms partnered with Petrobras. The natural gas unit is expected to open there in 2020. But this would only create about 5,000 jobs And the problem is, the closing of Comperj and devastation of Itaboraí is not an isolated incident… it happened all over Brazil. And all over Latin America. Operation Car Wash successfully revealed systemic corruption in Brazil. Car Wash put ex-President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva in jail, contributed to the downfall of his successor Dilma Rousseff, and a related investigation has led to her successor Michel Temer, being charged for corruption. The ex-CEO of Odebrecht was sentenced to 19 years in prison. Eike Batista, once Brazil’s richest man was sentenced to 30 years. But the same companies were funding major infrastructure projects all over Brazil. So the scandal brought many to an abrupt stop. This nuclear power plant in Angra dos Reis, for instance. Like Comperj, it was halted in 2015 because of direct involvement in the Car Wash scheme. $60 million in bribes were paid out of the project’s funding. By 2016 , 11 projects were reportedly stalled in Brazil alone. It didn’t stop there. The engineering companies involved worked all over Latin America and in 2016, 17 projects were reportedly stalled in at least 7 countries. Like this irrigation project in Peru. Where 3 former presidents have been accused of taking bribes from Odebrecht. In Colombia, this river dredging project was stopped after Odebrecht admitted to paying $11 million in bribes. And in Venezuela, at least 23 infrastructure projects have been suspended. These stalled projects mean lots of layoffs. A report estimates the Car Wash scandal wiped out 500,000 jobs in Brazil alone. Over four years after the scandal broke, Brazil’s unemployment is still high. Operation Car Wash is a blessing and a curse. On one hand, it's uncovering systemic corruption that has plagued Brazil for decades. But on the other, it's threatening Brazil's democracy. For many, the prosecution of prominent leaders, especially Lula, who was imprisoned at a time when he was leading in the elections polls, has revealed a bias in Brazil's judicial system. The elections are now the most divisive in the country’s history, with many losing faith in their political leaders. "

201,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,v7xmkzVU29Q,"This is an EpiPen. It’s a device that injects you with adrenaline if you’re having a possibly deadly allergic reaction. If you have severe allergies, you basically need it. And if you live in the UK, an EpiPen will cost you the equivalent of 38 US dollars. But if you live in the US, it’ll cost you $300. And it’s not just the EpiPen. Let’s look at five of the top selling prescription drugs in the world. Advair, a brand-name asthma inhaler: more expensive in the US. Lantus, a type of Insulin: more expensive in the US. Sovaldi for hepatitis C? Yup. Costs more in the US. Humira for arthritis. Crestor for cholesterol: more expensive in the US. So here’s an unsurprising chart: Americans spend more on prescription drugs than anyone else in the world. Why? The first thing you have to understand is that in the US, drugs get to patients differently than almost everywhere else. Let’s look at that popular hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi. In 2014 Sovaldi became the first drug to completely cure hepatitis C. Here’s how it got to market in, for example, the UK. First a government agency had to decide that Sovaldi was safe and that it actually worked. Then it was evaluated by a regulatory agency to see if was worthwhile: Are there too many side effects? Is there already a similar drug? Is there a cheaper option? Sovaldi was deemed worthwhile. Next, they negotiated the price. In the UK, the government buys the stock of medicine for the country. That means they’re usually able to get a lower rate, kind of like a bulk discount. Which keeps prescription drugs cheaper for UK citizens. In almost every developed country besides the US, this is what the system looks like: Safety evaluation, assessment of whether the country needs it, price negotiations, sold to patients. Now let’s look at the system in the US. First, the drug is evaluated for safety, but that’s it. If it’s safe, they can sell it, end of story. Drugs are sold by the drug companies to patients, usually through insurance. And since the US system lets them sell it for any price, Gilead, the company that makes Sovaldi, charged Americans more for it. When it first came to market, the entire treatment cost $84,000 in the US. In the UK? Just about $58,000 US dollars. That’s still a lot of money, but it’s a full 30% less. So it seems like the UK has the better system right? Well, it’s complicated. These photos are from protests in the US against the high price of EpiPens. And these are photos from protests in the UK, over the lack of access to a cystic fibrosis drug called Orkambi. That’s because when there’s a committee that determines whether a new drug is worthwhile — sometimes they say no. And when they negotiate the prices, sometimes they don’t come to an agreement and hit a standoff. That’s what’s happening with Orkambi. Both systems require trade offs. Regulated drug markets tend to make drugs more affordable, but some drugs are completely unavailable. And while the US has more drugs technically available, they’re often too expensive to actually afford. Americans without insurance are the most likely to skip medication because of the cost. Even Americans with insurance, are second. But the commonality between these two systems — is the drug companies. Developing new drug products isn’t cheap and they’re for-profit businesses. If Gilead didn’t think that researching and developing a hepatitis C cure, would make them money in the end, they might not have. And with these regulated markets keeping costs down, the only place the drug companies can really make their money is, you guessed it, the US. Americans are essentially subsidizing the cost of drugs for the rest of the world. In other words, a big part of why prescription drugs are more expensive in the US is because they’re cheaper everywhere else.

202,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,v8O8Em_RPNg," For some of you, the book that I’m holding may invoke some feelings of nostalgia. But, for others, maybe some feelings of inadequacy. These are Magic Eye stereograms. They created a sensation when they came out in the 90s, and it’s easy to see why — a 2D picture that creates a 3D image, if you do a certain thing with your eyeballs!? ELAINE: Look there’s a space ship. That is so cool! MR. PITTS: WHERE IS IT!? I feel like I didn’t realize back then how neat these are. But I do now, so let’s talk about it. Stereograms can be designed to be viewed cross-eyed but all the ones in this video are for divergent viewing. That means that rather than having your eyes pointed at the image itself, you’re supposed to over diverge your eyes, as if you’re looking through the image at something beyond it. It’s tricky because normally the lens in our eyes focuses on the thing our eyes are pointed at, but for these, you need to focus on the image while pointing your eyes at a spot beyond it. Some stereogram books come with a handy guide — these two dots at the top should help position your eyes. You want to relax your eyes until you see double vision, so 4 dots, but then pull it back so that they overlap and you get 3 dots. Then glance down and you should see the cathedral of Saint Basil in Moscow. If you still can’t see them, there’s a trick you can do in Photoshop. Duplicate the image and use the “difference” blending mode — which highlights where the two images are the same — in black. Then if you pull the top copy across... A silhouette of the hidden image appears. I’ll explain how all this works, but first, it helps to understand how Magic Eye emerged from a long history of research on visual perception So, our pupils are about 60mm apart — that means each eye gets a slightly different picture projected onto its retina. WAYNE: Camera 1. Camera 2. Camera 1. Camera 2. The reason we don’t have constant double vision from these two different pictures is that the brain immediately combines them into one. And in doing so, it uses the differences in the 2 pictures to add depth to our visual perception. This is stereopsis, or 3D vision, and it was first described by an English inventor in the 1830s, Charles Wheatstone. It took scientists a while to realize that having two eyes gives us depth information, because it’s not the only depth cue that we have. Shut one eye and it’s probably tough to thread a needle but the world doesn’t become completely flat. Wheatstone revealed stereopsis with a device that could display a slightly different image to each eye, simulating how each eye would take in a real life 3D object, but with flat images. And it successfully tricked the brain into perceiving depth. This was the first stereoscope. After the invention of photography, a Scottish physicist named David Brewster developed a handheld stereoscope and a version of it was displayed at the Great Exhibition in London in 1851. Queen Victoria was reportedly delighted by it and before long it was a super common household item through the last half of the 19th century. The dual photos were made with stereo cameras, which have two lenses spaced eye-distance apart, and they were used to document all sorts of historical events. Stereo cameras eventually went out of style but you might recognize this more modern version of a stereoscope. And that same principle of creating a 3D image by showing each eye a slightly different picture continues with 3D glasses and virtual reality headsets. But it’s not all for amusement. Stereoscopy has also been used for all sorts of aerial imaging applications. British photo interpreters in World War 2 used overlapping images taken from airplanes to detect Nazi military assets. This ability of stereoscopes to thwart camouflage by making objects pop out of seemingly flat aerial images inspired the development of the random dot stereogram — that’s the kind with a hidden 3D image. In 1960, a leading vision researcher named Bela Julesz created a computer-generated random-dot stereogram. He started with a grid of random dots and duplicated it, but in the copy, he shifted a square patch of the dots slightly to the left, filling in the leftover space with other random dots. If you look at these images through a stereoscope, or if you’ve trained your eyes enough to free-fuse the images by pointing one eye at each one, you’ll see the square pop out from the random dots. With this experiment, Julesz showed that the brain could detect depth even without any recognizable objects in the images. What’s different about the Magic Eye-type of pictures, also known as “autostereograms” is that you don’t need any special device to view them because it’s one image instead of two. Instead of two different pictures, autostereograms repeat the images within one picture. To understand how these work, let’s first look at a simpler type of autostereogram. This is a so-called “wallpaper stereogram.” It doesn’t have a hidden image. Instead, it just has repeating patterns that appear at different levels of depth when you diverge your eyes. So relax your eyes as though you’re looking through the screen and you should see the airplanes fall back with the rest of the grid. The dinosaurs, which are repeated at slightly closer intervals, should appear in a plane nearer to you and the cakes, repeated at even shorter intervals, should be even&nbsp;nearer. You should also see one more of each icon than there really is — there are only 6 cakes in the image but you’re seeing 7. And all of the icons should appear to be slightly bigger than they really are. So why is this happening? This diagram shows the view from above your head and these dots represent icons on a simple autostereogram like the one i just showed you. When you let your eyes diverge, instead of fixing them on one of the icons, each eye is seeing its own icon. Because your brain is used to turning two similar pictures into one — it assumes the two icons are actually one icon that’s further back and larger, rather than two that are closer. This illusion happens across the image, with every pair of repeated icons being wrongly interpreted as one. The right-most and left-most icons don't have pairs on their other side so you end up with 7 — 5 illusory icons plus the edge ones. Pairs that are repeated at closer intervals, like the cakes were in the previous image, appear nearer to you. So it’s the interval of repetition that can be manipulated to adjust depth. And if we go from icons to something smaller, you can start to see how they build a 3D image that can be easily camouflaged with noise. You can see that in this stereogram we made using letters instead of icons. If you diverge your eyes, you should see some of these words pop out to reveal a message. The two asterisks are there as a guide — you should see 3 of them, and then slowly bring your eyes down. What’s happening is that the regular repetition interval in this image is 16 characters, including spaces. But in this interval, we removed a letter, bringing this pair slightly closer together than all the other pairs. So as your brain fuses that pair, the resulting image appears closer to you than the rest. Autosterograms start with a base pattern that repeats across the image but with select dots or pixels shifted to vary the depth and compose the 3D figure. The first random-dot autostereograms were made by hand in the 1970s. This one by a Japanese graphic designer shows an array of hidden squares and this one by a Swiss painter has overlapping rectangles. But by the 1980s, vision researcher Christopher Tyler and programmer Maureen Clark had come up with an algorithm that could embed more complicated depth images into a random-dot autostereogram. Using the red dots as a guide, you should see a 3D surface pop out that’s much more complicated than a wallpaper or a simple rectangle. The algorithms that produce these images work from a depth map — that's a black and white image that tells the program to make the repetition interval shorter for the dots that make up the lighter, and nearer, parts of the image. In the final product you can’t tell which dots have been shifted or how much, but if you go back to that Photoshop trick and scan through the image — you can see how the nearest parts of the shark repeat at closer intervals than the most distant parts of the shark. Everything in the base image repeats at the same interval, except the dots that make up the shark. In the 90s, artist Cheri Smith and engineer Tom Baccei developed their own method, using bright colorful patterns as their base. They branded them as “Magic Eye” and published the first of many books in 1993. After that, they were everywhere. “Hey can you see it? You gotta see it. You really gotta see it, come on give it a try” Magic Eye put out VHS tapes that included animated stereograms; they sold posters; they were printed in newspapers. And some people...got left behind. “I’ve been staring at this thing for a week now, from opening to closing, and I can't see a gooddamn thing!” If you can’t see them, it may be that you have some visual impairment that affects your stereo vision. But for most of us, learning to diverge your eyes just takes a little bit of practice. “Today’s my day. I brought a lunch and a soda... and I’m not going to leave until I see this sailboat everyone keeps talking about.” "
203,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,vfKgABPe__g,"This is me, and this is my sister, Annie she’s 28, mom to two cats, freelance designer and part-time grad student There’s just something about freelancing. I feel a lot of creative freedom She’s also had had chronic back pain, neck pain, migraines for as long as she can remember She health insurance through Obamacare, and without it, there’s no way she’d be able to afford all her doctors’ appointments and medications And because she doesn’t have to depend on an employer for insurance, she’s able to work for herself the flexibility works really well with being able to make my appointments around my work schedule on election night, my first thought was, ""what does this mean for my sister?"" Donald Trump, elected president of the United States and for the 22 million other people who get their health insurance through Obamacare “Today, after over a year of debate, health insurance reform becomes law in the United States of America” “We’re gonna try and repeal this” “There’s only one way to fix Obamacare, and that’s a full repeal” “Can we replace this law, completely, in the next presidency, in the next congress. That is our goal, and the answer is yes we can.” ""When we win on November 8, we will be able to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare” Obamacare is a big law, with lots of different parts And there are some parts that Trump and Republicans in Congress say they want to keep. For example: before Obamacare, companies could refuse to sell insurance to people with lots of health problems. Obamacare says they can’t do that anymore, and Trump and the Republicans say they want to keep it that way. The problem is, this piece of the law that they like only works because of another piece of the law that they don’t like...a piece they’ve promised to get rid of That’s the part of the law that says you have to have health insurance, or pay a fine. For health insurance to be affordable, you need a lot of healthy people to sign up for every one sick person That’s because health insurance is worth more to sick people, and they’ll pay more for it, which pushes up premiums for everyone. The healthy people in the pool help keep those costs down. If Trump and the Republicans get rid of the individual mandate, which they say they will, a bunch of healthy people are going to stop buying insurance, premiums go up, more healthy people leave Until all that’s left are sick people who are really expensive to cover. Without a bunch of healthy people to offset that cost, insurance companies would pull out of the marketplace we know this because in some places, it was already happening before the election. Too many healthy people were choosing the fine over health insurance As a result, states like Alabama and Oklahoma only have one insurance plan on the market--and without competition, premiums shot up last year. If Trump and the Republicans get rid of the individual mandate, we’ll likely see this happen in other states. Like Texas, where my sister lives So, what might her life look like under the Republican replacement for Obamacare? Right now, Obamacare makes it illegal for insurance companies to charge her more just because she has health problems. Under Paul Ryan’s plan, that changes. Insurance companies would be allowed to charge her more if she ever let her coverage lapse. Instead of forcing insurance companies to offer affordable plans to people like my sister, Paul Ryan’s plan would fund “high-risk pools,” insurance plans specifically for people with lots of health problems, but we don’t know exactly who would be eligible for them. These pools were around before Obamacare-- and without healthy people to balance the sick people, these plans end up being about twice as expensive for participants. Paul Ryan’s plan does call for refundable tax credits to help offset those costs. Congressional Republicans have tried getting rid of the individual mandate before. But those votes were largely symbolic But it’s real now. My sister has built a life for herself where she can take professional risks go back to school , be her own boss, and not have to rely on an employer for health insurance. Now, she and 22 million others are asking how long that will last. "
204,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,vxhyzPUHQQw,"You may have heard the word 'Benghazi' a few times are few thousand times in the past few years – ""Benghazi"" – – ""Probes about Benghazi"" – – ""Benghazi committee"" – –&nbsp;""You wouldn't have had your Benghazi situation"" – Whether from Fox News and Republicans in Congress who insist it's a major scandal or some liberals joking about it on Twitter, it all has to do with Republicans' deeper beliefs about Barack Obama's presidency and with the politics surrounding Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. But to see how Benghazi fits into all of that you need to know exactly what happened in Benghazi, in the first place. On the night of September 11th 2012 a group of Islamist militia members attacked a US diplomatic outpost in Benghazi Libya. They killed four Americans including the US ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens who was visiting from Tripoli that week. The city was a centre of the US-backed rebellion that toppled Muammar Qaddafi the year before, and a number of armed groups had emerged in the aftermath. It was a dangerous environment. However, the US had no intelligence suggesting a specific attack was imminent. At 9:42 pm, the the militiamen easily breached the gates of the compound and set fire to the building. A subsequent State Department review blamed systemic failures at the department's senior levels for the mission's poor security. Stevens had previously requested more security and not gotten it. In the chaos of the attack US security officers were separated from Stevens and Sean Smith, another State Department official. The two men died of smoke inhalation later that night A team from the nearby CIA annex arrived and engaged militants before taking survivors back to the extra mile away at 11:15PM.  40 minutes later the attackers laid siege to the annex as well. resumed around 5:15 a.m. with two more Americans security agents Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty killed by mortars firing on the annex. This later became a big controversy. Republicans accused Obama of withholding further military support that might have saved the day. But there were simply no military assets that could have gotten there in time. Starting around 7 a.m. the Americans were able to escape the compound and leave the country. The CIA initially blamed the attack on a mob protesting an anti-Islam movie which had sparked protests elsewhere in the middle east. Then UN Ambassador Susan Rice made this claim on several Sunday talk shows RICE: it began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some RICE:hours earlier in cairo. That turned out to be mostly wrong. The attackers were members of Islamist militias we now know; not random mob. Republicans accuse the Obama administration of campaign with intelligence specifically in races talking points for the sunday shows to hide the fact there was a terrorist attack. WALLACE: Did the Obama administration play down what happened in Libya what WALLACE: happened in cairo because it would make Obama foreign policy look better? But later investigation showed that she'd honestly repeated CIA analysis rather than deliberately lying. Still, amidst the controversy, Rice withdrew herself from consideration to become the next Secretary of State There have been eight official investigations into Benghazi mostly involving or led by congressional Republicans and none has found any real evidence of a cover-up, or wrongdoing by the administration with the exception of the state department's internal report blaming its own incompetence for failing to provide sufficient security. So why are republicans still investigating? Partly out of a certainty that something was wrong stemming from deep-seated Republican beliefs that Obama is both week on terror in corruptly authoritarian, enough to hide the truth. But this is also about politics. Republicans want to embarrass Obama and damage Hillary Clinton who was then Secretary of State the time of the attack. House majority leader Kevin McCarthy admitted as much on national television. MCCARTHY: Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable right? but we put together MCCARTHY: a Benghazi special committee. A select committee. What are her numbers today? Her MCCARTHY: numbers are dropping. Why? Cause she's untrustable. And its kind of worked. The Clinton email scandal rose from one of the Benghazi investigations. So you can bet we'll be hearing about Benghazi well into the presidential election. "
205,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,wOrmr5kT-48,"This is the first Apple computer mouse. It came with Apple’s ten thousand dollar Lisa computer, and it was designed by a product design consulting firm that would eventually become known as IDEO. The assignment was straightforward: they had to take the computer mouse — a 400-dollar device at the time — and bring it down to under 35 bucks, make it mass-producible, and reliable. And above all, it needed to be simple. [Apple commercial] ""We control these so, by pointing to these images on the screen with this unique item called a mouse."" Fast forward about thirty years, and IDEO doesn’t really create products anymore. They’ve transitioned to designing networks and experiences — things like Los Angeles’ voting system, and the Red Cross’s method for finding donors — even entire schools. So what does making a computer mouse have to do with creating a school system from scratch? It turns out, quite a lot. [Tim Brown] “The world we live in is one where, really, the complex things are the things that are mostly broken."" ""Not the simple things."" ""We have lots of great products, lots of beautiful products."" ""Lots of products we can use everyday, everything from furniture to tableware, to consumer electronics."" ""— and they’re mostly pretty good, right?"" ""Yes, there’s opportunity to do better, and to do more, but I'm interested in things that"" ""don't work very well, and the things that you can impact society with."" ""And they’re mostly the more complex things.” Back in 1971, a designer named Victor Papanek wrote a book called, “Design For The Real World”. The premise was pretty simple: creators could take some of the same design strategies from the creation of industrial products and use them to tackle problems like pollution, overcrowding, and food shortages. By 2001, IDEO had done just that, pivoting from products to real world experiences. But the design steps? Tim Brown says they stay just about the same. “The first piece is observing the world in order to ask an interesting question, right?"" ""I mean, you could observe the world in lots of different ways — when we talk about human-centered design,"" ""we're really talking about observing the way humans live their lives and asking"" ""interesting questions about, 'Hey, why does somebody do this? And not that?' ""Why is somebody struggling with this problem?"" ""Why is it hard for somebody to open that, why are they struggling to open up that jam jar lid?” “Maybe I could redesign the jam jar, or maybe I could give them a tool to help them, right?"" ""So why is this happening?"" So, the first step is looking at the world and coming up with good question.” For making a mouse, that means watching how people use computers, observing what they want, and what they don’t. For designing a school, that meant spending a month in Peru, meeting with students, parents, teachers, investors, and government and business leaders to address needs like academic planning, modular classroom space, accessible technology and affordable tuition. “The next step is taking all the insights that you have from those questions, and starting to imagine ideas—"" ""Like here's what I could do, here's what I might imagine doing better, or differently."" "" So, that's what we often call ideation or ideamaking.” Then comes the fun part. You test it out. “Right at the beginning of the process might be a really simple cardboard model, or a quick sketch."" ""Or if it's digital, it might be a quick digital simulation, or something, and you try out on people."" Sometimes those drafts can be pretty rough — the first prototype for the mouse was a roll-on deodorant stick and a butter dish from a Palo Alto Walgreens. “And you test it. If that doesn't work okay, so I need to rethink my idea and I do it again."" ""And this is where the iteration comes in: you learn from the prototype, you realize what's not working."" ""Or maybe it’s a crummy idea and you have to go back and find a new idea again."" “And you go through that loop over and over again: asking the question, having ideas,"" ""prototyping, learning and until you get to something that truly meets somebody’s needs, or a set of people's needs.” “Now the last bit of the process… which arguably happens in that iteration also, is the storytelling piece."" Because always you're trying to explain to people why your idea is interesting.” [Apple commercial: “A computer for the rest of us.” “I think what you need to design a complex system is not one brain — you need lots of brains."" ""You need lots of brains with different perspectives different creative contributions, working together"" ""to get to an outcome that is that is literally rich enough, and sophisticated enough"" ""to be able to behave like a system, instead of being like an object.” "
206,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,wtZdJKH4us8,"So in the past few years, we’ve seen state legislatures introduce bills that basically require that students have to learn cursive writing in elementary school. Cursive handwriting is not in the Common Core state standards which have replaced the English and Language Arts standards in 43 states. And so this is led to a concern that if it’s not on the test, if students can type their assignments or print their assignments, cursive handwriting is just going to disappear and die out. But the truth is, cursive was really fading out before the Common Core. In 2006, the SAT started to require an essay -- and this is how we have data on what students chose to write. And only 15% of students used cursive, this was kids who were in elementary school in the 90s. Cursive handwriting became taught more commonly at the same time that education become more democratic. So it started with something called the Spencerian script. If you’ve seen a college diploma, if you’ve seen a wedding invitation with that really loopy, fancy writing, that’s what the Spencerian script was. It’s beautiful. But obviously it’s not very practical to learn to write this really gorgeous, loopy handwriting. And so in the 1920s, which was when education was becoming much more universal, not just at the elementary level but continuing on past that, that’s also when they developed a new method of writing cursive. It’s called the Palmer Method. Certainly if you have a grandparent with beautiful handwriting, they’re probably writing the Palmer method. And there were two major cursive styles that were taught from the 1960s on: The D’Nealian method, and the Zane-Bloser method. This is a big debate. Is there a reason to learn cursive, besides sort of a nostalgic idea that this is an important skill that you have as an adult? The arguments in favor are that it’s a fine motor skill thing, it’s good for kids to have learn to use their hands this way. And there’s also this sort of patriotic argument that the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence are written in cursive, and what if kids can’t read these founding documents in the original print. The arguments against teaching cursive are mostly that nobody has shown that there’s really a major benefit to learning cursive. So it’s a lot of time and energy spent in the third and 4th grade, learning basically a second system of writing after you’ve already learned to write. "
207,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,xHSnHj-zKF4,"The average person has 27 unique web logins. To create an account on a site, you have to register with a username and password. And most people pick passwords that are easy to remember. Actually, a lot of us end up using the same password for all of our websites, which is understandable, but risky. There are many different ways that hackers can get your password. They can use programs that try to guess it by randomly cycling through different combinations, hacking the website itself, or phishing, by sending fake emails that look like they’re from a website or company, but actually aren’t. All of this spells bad news for people that reuse the same password because you’re putting yourself at much higher risk for hackers being able to get into your emails, your photos, and even your bank info. Last year Yahoo made headlines when it was the victim of a massive cyber attack, With sensitive information being stolen from 1 billion accounts. So if you had a Yahoo account and you used that same password for other sites, you were now vulnerable to all those other accounts being hacked too. Every time there’s a big hack like this, experts tell us to stop using the same password for every website. In fact, they say we should stop memorizing our passwords altogether, recommending that we use something called a password manager instead. I know, I know, it already sounds complicated. But trust me, it’s really not. And it will help make all of your accounts much more secure. We currently think of passwords as things that we memorize and store inside our heads. But since we’re really bad at remembering random things, there’s a limit to how complex your password can be, and how many different ones you’ll be able to remember. As a result, most people have really simple passwords, and many use the same one across all their logins. This sucks because if a hacker gets access to your one password, they then have access to all of your different accounts. And if your password is uncomplicated, it’s astonishingly easy for hackers to guess it. For instance, if you use a password like, well, password, which is actually the eighth most commonly used one, it would take a hacker mere milliseconds to guess it. But if you use a password manager to generate a 15-digit series of random upper and lowercase letters and numbers, that time jumps up to 609 million years. The biggest thing we need to do is stop keeping our passwords inside our heads. Instead, we need to put them somewhere else and lock them up, like a virtual safe. This is what the password manager does. It’s basically an app that keeps all of your passwords secure inside of a safe that only you can unlock. This way you only need to remember one password. And once you unlock the safe you can see all of your many different passwords in one place. Since it’s an app, you can access your passwords from any device you’ve installed it on. And since you don’t need to remember all your passwords anymore, you can make them really long and complicated. So what happens if your password manager gets hacked? They would have access to all your individual passwords then, right? Not necessarily. The password manager encrypts your data, so if a hacker looks inside your safe, all they’ll see is scrambled passwords. LastPass was hacked in 2015 and users had to change their master passwords. But the individual passwords inside were safe because of this encryption. It may seem like it would be annoying to have to retrieve your password for every single website. But, actually, most password managers have browser plugins that automatically fill your info in for you. So in many cases, it’s actually easier. And besides, it’s better than the alternative: becoming one of the millions of Americans that get hacked every year. "
208,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,xuiDuoRJkOY," In the United States, around 3 million people work with classified information as part of their job. That includes people who work in the military, for government agencies like the CIA, or for private companies hired by those agencies. Let’s say you are one of those people. And you learn something that bothers you. Because this is your job, you know that the laws around classified information are serious. But let’s say the thing you learn is really bad. Maybe a government program is wasting billions of taxpayer dollars. Or a federal agency is spying on millions of ordinary Americans. Or, the head of your government is making shadowy deals with foreign leaders for personal gain. You have a decision to make. A sort of “choose your own adventure.” But behind each door is a different set of risks. If you decide to expose what you’ve learned, that’s called whistleblowing. And in the US, it’s often regarded as a brave, patriotic thing to do. There are laws to protect it. But the reality, for the 3 million people who work with classified information, is much more complicated. What would you do? This is Daniel Ellsberg, an American military analyst in the 1960s. Ellsberg learned that the US government had lied to the public about why the US was at war in Vietnam, and about how deadly the war was. In 1971, he gave 7,000 classified documents that exposed those lies to the New York Times, and then to 20 other newspapers. Ellsberg took door #1: leaking your evidence of government wrongdoing, directly to the media. His leak became known as the “Pentagon Papers.” Three years later, the US pulled out of the war. But leaking classified information to the media is illegal. And in Ellsberg's case, the government made him a target. “We've got to keep our eye on the main ball, the main ball is Ellsberg. We got to get this son of a bitch.” The federal government charged Ellsberg under the Espionage Act, a law from 1917, originally written to go after spies working with foreign governments. But Ellsberg got lucky. It turned out that the government had broken the law by spying on him, and a judge threw out the charges. He was free to go. But other leakers haven’t been so lucky. Chelsea Manning, an American soldier, leaked classified documents to Wikileaks in 2010, including evidence that the US had committed war crimes in Iraq. She went to prison for 7 years. In 2013, the cybersecurity expert Edward Snowden leaked evidence of a massive government surveillance program to international newspapers. He fled the United States to avoid being prosecuted for espionage. Leaking classified information to the media is one common kind of whistleblowing. But it’s also illegal, so it's treacherous for those that risk it. Fortunately, in the US there’s another option: to go through official, internal channels for coming forward with a complaint. This is door #2: legal whistleblowing. In 1998, the US created a process for people who work with classified information to file complaints: First to an inspector general, and then to the director of national intelligence, and then on to Congress. This is someone who worked in national security at the time. His name is Thomas Drake. Shortly after September 11th, Drake learned that the National Security Agency was part of an unprecedented program inside the federal government, called “Stellar Wind.” The program collected emails, phone conversations, financial transactions, and the web activity of millions of American citizens, without a warrant. What are we doing violating the Constitution? I knew that if I remained silent that I would be complicit in a crime. Drake considered taking what he knew to the press, but knew it would put him at risk. I knew that that was fraught with enormous peril. I was extremely familiar what happened to Daniel Ellsberg. Luckily, he had a legal route he could follow. He brought his concerns to his supervisor, to his own agency’s inspector general’s office, and eventually to Congress. But his agency told him that no matter what the Constitution said, the White House said the program was legal, and that that was good enough for them. ""I could feel the hair standing up on the back of my neck, because I was thrown back to the 70s, and Nixon.” Drake's next problem was that the 1998 law he had been following didn’t do anything to protect him against retaliation. Drake's identity became public within his agency, and he was gradually pushed out of his job. I was increasingly isolated. They finally removed me from all positions, all responsibilities, all programs. There's no recourse, and no penalty if the agency decides to retaliate against you. Finally, after Drake’s complaints went nowhere, he chose a different path. He went to the media. And because he remembered what happened to Ellsberg, &nbsp;he chose to share unclassified information, which meant it was legal. But then, in 2010, the Obama administration accused him of violating the Espionage Act, the same as Ellsberg, who had leaked classified information. ""Thomas Drake is charged with violating espionage laws."" ""Prosecutors claimed that Drake had betrayed his country."" Drake’s case was only the fourth time in history that the Espionage Act had been used to prosecute a whistleblower. But since the Obama administration, it’s become a lot more common. Eventually the case collapsed because Drake did nothing illegal. But his career in the government was over. Today, he works at an Apple Store. The price is enormous. I have no retirement. That's gone. You lose your entire social network, in terms of work. There's people who lost their jobs because of their association with me. Those are burdens that I will carry with me the rest of my life. In August 2019, an officer in the CIA filed a whistleblower complaint saying that President Trump was trying to pressure Ukraine to investigate one of his political rivals. Just like Drake, the officer followed the process laid out in the law. He took the complaint to the inspector general. The inspector general took it to the director of national intelligence. Then it stopped. The director of national intelligence never brought it to Congress. So the inspector general went over his head. ""Deeply disturbing, what we read this morning."" ""I’m announcing the House of Representatives moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry."" Testimony from witnesses in the impeachment investigation has backed up almost everything laid out in the whistleblower complaint. And whistleblower protections were updated in 2012 with more explicit language, saying the government can’t retaliate against a whistleblower the way they did against Thomas Drake. So the whistleblower should be protected. But where the laws still fall short is whether it’s a crime to reveal a whistleblower’s identity to the public. That’s what the president and his allies are hoping to do next. ""There’s no law that prevents me from mentioning the name of who’s been said to be the whistleblower."" ""The whistleblower... ...should be revealed."" The parts of the government that deal in secrecy are also the least accountable to the public. And whistleblowers in those agencies are some of the only ways wrongdoing there might ever come to light. But the system fails them. And every retaliation sends a clear message. If both leaking, and legal whistleblowing, leave government whistleblowers vulnerable, this system will push more and more people who know something’s wrong, into door number three: doing nothing at all.

209,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,y7rOjh4Lr78,"When I googled the “fastest animal” this is what I got. A cheetah. A little mammal bias maybe? The truly fastest animal on Earth has a max speed 3 times greater than the cheetah. Peregrine falcons can leisurely cruise through the skies between 40 and 60 miles per hour, but when they’re diving toward their prey, they can reach speeds over 200 miles per hour. That comes out to 293 feet per second. It’s like flying the length of a football field in 1.2 seconds. Or the length of this DC block. So how is it even possible for peregrines to dive this fast? A peregrine falcon is around the size of a crow—weighing between one and three pounds with a wingspan up to 3.6 feet. They prey on other birds by dive-bombing them and snatching them mid-air. The first thing you see when a peregrine goes into its dive, also called a stoop, is their bullet-shaped bodies. Notice how the peregrine tucks in its feet, and sweeps back its tail and wings. This streamlined figure reduces wind turbulence, maximizes maneuverability, lift, and speed as it cuts through the air. It wouldn’t be able to do this nearly as efficiently if had broad wings like a hawk or an owl. But the peregrine’s wings are pointed and angled back. And because of its stiff unslotted feathers, it experiences less drag—the wind would pull on loose feathers on other birds. Peregrines also have a large keel — that’s this breast bone. A bigger keel supports stronger chest muscles. Acute vision allows them to spot prey a mile away. The nictitating membrane, or third-eyelid, helps to maintain their vision in their high-speed dives, and the secretory gland keeps their corneas from drying out because of all that wind. But none of this would be possible if the peregrine couldn’t breathe. The air speeds that Peregrine falcons experience while diving would make it impossible for most animals to breathe, but they have a bone in their nostrils to slow down the airflow. They also have robust hearts that beat around 600 to 900 beats per minute. All birds have a vastly more efficient respiratory system than mammals. Then to finally catch her prey, the peregrine is pulling around 25 G’s coming out of a stoop—compare that to a F-16 fighter pilot who endures up to 9 G’s during some maneuvers. On speed alone peregrines are formidable birds of prey but it isn’t their only adaptation of note. Footage from our friends at BBC Earth shows where this wanderer has made its mark in some unexpected places. After a sharp recovery from near extinction in North America—bustling cities with soaring skyscrapers and towering cathedrals have become many peregrine’s new kingdom; a plentiful hunting ground with high perches and deliciously plump pigeons.

210,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,yOK3bF3jhXU,"This is a coupon for Burger King's Croissan'wich, and it's promoting a buy one get one deal. Buy one breakfast sandwich at full price get a second. But one customer found that something was off about the deal: when she was charged two different prices for the sandwich. When she ordered a single sandwich, the price was $2.16. But when she ordered two sandwiches and used the BOGO coupon the price of each sandwich was $3.19, more than a dollar more. This went on for years before Burger King was sued for overcharging customers. BOGO is so appealing that it's hard for consumers to see it for what it is. Buy one, get one. It's a thinly veiled attempt to convince a customer to buy more than one item at a time. For a thrifty shopper, BOGO can sound like the best way to get more bang for their buck, but often it's simply not as good a deal as it appears. Consumers perceive the quality of a bargain based on the price they pay compared to the original list price. Take this food processor on Amazon for example. The price on sale is $35, an amazing 52% off the $75 dollar list price. The problem is that Cuisinart doesn't list the item for Amazon's regular price and based on an analysis of tracked prices over time, Amazon has never sold it for more than $40 in the past 10 years. The cheating that goes on is rampant. Retailers are guilty, often, of distorting the regular price, raising the regular price. And several companies have been caught distorting prices in conjunction with BOGO offers. The suit accuses Visionworks of inflating the price of the first pair of glasses to partly cover the costs of the second, supposedly free pair, making it not actually free. It can be hard for consumers to tell whether BOGO is fair or deceptive and often their judgment is clouded by one four letter word: Free. I mean, free is a tremendous motivational trigger and they like the opportunity to expand the deal by buying more than one of an item. Very often consumers don't do the math. Buying more than one item means consumers spend more money than they intended. Not less. For example, say you want to buy a sweater that's normally $80. Sweater A is listed at a 20% discount. Sweater B is listed at full price, but has a buy one, get one free deal. While the second option may get you two sweaters, you've just spent more in total than if you just focused on the 20% discount. Let's say those sweaters are on a buy one get one 50% off deal. Option one you buy one sweater for $80 dollars. Option two, the first sweater would be $80 dollars and the second would be half off. Translated into a straight discount, the total saved from the BOGO deal would be the same as a 25% off deal, but the amount of money you spend in store has grown, because you bought two items. Some BOGO deals only apply to items with lesser value. For example if you buy that same sweater and a $10 dollar pair of socks you still pay $80 for your total purchase. If you decide to get a sweater and $150 coat, the sweater would be counted as the free item and you'd still be shelling out $150. For most deals, you're better off waiting for the one item you wanted to go on sale rather than purchasing it through a BOGO deal. Customers... I won't say ""fall for it,"" but they go for it nonetheless. BOGO disguises the fact that, unless you already intended to buy two items, it really isn't all that big of a discount. So BOGO deals can be fantastic if you're a shopper looking to buy in bulk and stretch your dollar. But for most of us, free isn't always the best option. Well, just do the math. If it looks too good to be true it's too good to be true. "
211,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,ydwFZZ2AKpY,"So the Daily Show and the Colbert Report were both responses to the Bush years. They were about this alienation liberals felt from their country at a moment when Fox News seemed the authentic expression of the American psyche and George W. Bush kept winning elections. But then what happened is that liberals began winning elections. ""Did you guys hear? It looks like the Mets and the Tampa Bay Rays are in -- they're in some trade talks. Oh! by the way, did you guys hear about this?"" The constant crises of Obama's early presidency gave the shows a lot to work with at first, but as the Obama era quieted down, I think it put the Daily Show and the Colbert Report in a pretty strange position because Colbert and Stewart became the voices of the dominant political coalition. Punching Fox News kind of became punching down. ""Your distortions and lack of fact footholds against mine. To start us off, here's 50 of yours in a 6-second Vine."" Their replacements -- Trevor Noah at the Daily Show and Larry Wilmore in Colbert's slot -- are both talented black comedians. They have a real skill for taking on America's complicated, often really frustrating racial politics. ""Yeah I just flew in and boy are my arms tired."" ""Ok, alright there, oldie but a goodie. Very nice."" ""No, no seriously, I've been holding my arms like this since I got here."" And so their takeover is a recognition of one of the lessons of the Obama era, which is that American politics isn't moving past race. It's moving into it. This political scientist at Brown University, a guy named Michael Tesler, he goes and shows how in the 80s and 90s, when you polled racial controversies, you didn't see a big partisan split. So the number of Democrats who agreed with the O.J. verdict was 50% and the number of Republicans was 41%. But now you look at any controversy that has even a hint of race in it, like say the verdict with Zimmerman right, around Trayvon Martin. 68% of Democrats were angry about that. Only 20% of Republicans were angry about it. There was a poll about whether 12 Years a Slave should win an Oscar, and 53% of Democrats thought it should and only 15% of Republicans agreed. That isn't the kind of thing we've seen the political parties splitting on before. Tesler's book, ""Obama's race"" describes an inconvenient truth about the 2008 election: It was the most racialized election in modern American history. There's been no recent campaign in which racial attitudes did as much to drive political behavior and it's continued on. You even have racial differences in how much people like Obama's dog. If you show people a photo and you tell them it's Obama's dog, folks who rank as having a little bit more racial resentment, they tend to like that dog less than if you show them the same dog and tell them it's Ted Kennedy's dog. America is sort of at the end of the Obama era, working through its attitudes about race in a way it sort of hasn't had to for a very very long time. And you're seeing these shows try to update for that. ""I thought that Barack Obama was post-racial."" ""Yeah. He is. We're not."" "
212,News & Politics,25,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,yqmso0c9CBs,"What makes a street a street and an avenue an avenue? They're not just named at random. There’s no rulebook for building a city, but there are naming conventions that are surprisingly strong, ones you’ll find across the world. There are exceptions, but if you comb through postal service guides, state departments of transportation, and dictionaries, you can start to decipher a code behind our roads. It starts simple: a road can be anything that connects two points. A way is a small side street off a road. But then things build up. Streets are public ways that have buildings on both sides. And you’ll recognize them because they often run perpendicular to avenues, which will have trees or buildings on both sides too. The cardinal directions — North, South, East, or West — vary by city, but that perpendicular pattern of streets and avenues is common to many places. This is a boulevard — a big wide street with trees on both sides. You’ll find a median in a lot of boulevards, too. It’s basically the opposite of a lane, which is a narrow road, often in a rural area. A drive takes its cues from the environment — it’s a long winding road that might have its route shaped by a nearby mountain or lake. That might lead to a terrace: a street that follows the top of a slope. A place, however, is a road or a street with no throughway (basically a dead end). Meanwhile, a court will end in a circle or loop, without a throughway. It’s like a cousin to a plaza or square — an open public space that’s surrounded by businesses or streets. And all of these roads connect to the wider world. A frontage road (or access road or service road) runs parallel to a larger road, providing local access. That larger public road might be a highway — a major public road that connects larger cities. An interstate is part of a highway system, but it’s defined by being a federally funded network of roads. It often goes between states, but it doesn’t have to — Hawaii has Interstate H1, and you don’t want to take an interstate to get there. A turnpike is part of a highway, but it usually means you’ll hit a tollbooth, while a freeway is distinguished by size, with 2 or more lanes on each side. A beltway, meanwhile, is a highway that surrounds a whole city (like a belt). A parkway is a decorated public road, usually called that for the parkland on the side of the road. Wanna know why you drive on a parkway and park on a driveway? Parkways were originally more pastoral, and they had that parkland on the side, and driveways were often longer, making them “ways” off of “drives.” A junction is where two roads cross — in an interchange, it’s at a different height, while at an intersection it’s at the same height. Causeways are different raised roads that pass across low or swampy ground, or water. And the rest of the most common roads are the odds and ends. Crescents are winding roads that usually resemble...well, a crescent, and often attach to a road at both ends. An alley is a small pathway between buildings, which might not be driveable. And then there’s an esplanade — a long open path or road near the ocean, that’s also called a promenade if it’s primarily for walking. All these names aren’t there to confuse us, but to make roads and cities clearer. And now you won’t just know where you are, but how you got there, too. So these street naming conventions are just that — they are conventions, they are not hard and fast rules, and there are plenty of exceptions. And that is the case in Tuscon, Arizona, because in Tuscon, the streets run East/West, the avenues run North/South, and something called the Stravenue — postal abbreviation “STRA” — runs diagonally.

The flight from DC to here goes over Alaska and it flies over the  Bering Sea which is just south of the Arctic Circle and I was going to the bathroom or something and I peeked out the window and I saw this vast amazing sight of a frozen ocean that was basically kind of breaking up and melting. And it made me so curious about ice! By every measure, what I was looking at out that window is a record. It's a record low of ice pack for the Arctic Ocean. We're talking like over the past  past like several thousand years. Ok fine I'll go to unique love this Uniqlo This Uniqlo has row has 11 stories...12 stories So it turns out that ice is actually more important than you think. At least it was way more important than I thought. One of the more interesting functions that ice plays that it acts as a giant reflector basically bouncing a bunch of sunlight back up into space so that the earth doesn't have to absorb it. And this is actually super vital for keeping the earth systems regulated. The ice also keeps ocean currents running smoothly which a lot of species depend on including humans. Ice is more than just important for polar bears. It actually has huge ramifications for like our entire global ecosystem and all of the many systems that support I came to Tokyo for a totally different story. It  has nothing to do with climate change I'm pretty sure jaywalking in Japan is like a total faux pax. Definitely. Everyone's laughing at me . The view I had while flying over Alaska was beautiful. But the story it tells is one of potential disaster for our globe. I'm actually in Japan working on a couple of really interesting videos. I won't give any spoilers away but I'll give you a hint. It has to do with North Korea and with racist people. "

At the same time Richard Strauss another composer living in the same city basically was conducting his own music like this. You know, barely moving and if you think this is a quiet part in his music you're wrong. He thought the role of a conductor was to organize the music and keep everything calm. Our biggest job as a conductor, it's to do justice to the composer. My name is James Gaffigan I am a conductor. What the public needs to understand about conducting is it's an anticipatory art, so what we do takes place before the music happens. Rhythmic hand goes up before the music starts and this hand will give a gesture before that sound. I've always found it strange to hold a baton and it's a very strange thing, because why why is it there in the first place? But the fact of the matter is is it is an extension of your arm. If you just make a gesture like this, you just need to move your wrist and you don't have to be doing this all the time. Your right hand is mainly for keeping rhythm or keeping the beat patterns, so if you give an upbeat this is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4. If you have 2 4, it's very simple so 1 2 1 2 and you could be as small as this they'll realize that this is 2 4. From the left hand has a much more complex, strange role in our physical world and it's freer to do things that are out of the ordinary. It could be anything from showing where a phrase goes, it could show speed of a bow. String players are very physical in the sense that they they react to what they see. If you have your left hand open and if you have your right hand slightly open and you're holding this sound like as if you'd hold a baby they'll play that way. If you conduct like this they're gonna play like this. Percussion needs clarity from a conductor. They need to know where to hit something and the bass drum could play only one note in an hour-long symphony, but that note is very important. The worst thing you could do to a brass player before he or she plays is this. Because if they see the hand before they have to make the beautiful sound that they need to make it's gonna destroy their confidence and it's gonna make their lives very difficult. Playing the French Horn, there's so much that person needs to think about and it's such a delicate instrument, such a delicate moment. Leonard Bernstein was one of the greatest musicians who who had ever lived, not just as a conductor but as a pianist and as a composer. He was able to educate not just adults but children. Of course when you watch him, he's always dancing and he can't he can't help moving around the podium and his rhythm is contagious. Karajan believed in beautiful sound, upholstered sound, luxurious sound. So if you hear some of the great recordings of Karajan, it's not always together at these crucial moments but there's a beauty of sound always from beginning to end. I mean he had his eyes closed half the time and everything was he was just holding this precious thing all the time and crouched over. Carlos Kleiber was all you know, he was holding a magic wand. He was fantasy, pure fantasy. He would make beautiful story lines to pieces that didn't have story lines. He was all about this gesture and these beautiful sweeping gestures. I don't believe in jumping around during a Bruckner symphony, I think there's something sacred and it's unnecessary. I do believe in having a great time with jazz music and music that swings. You should make the audience want to dance although you shouldn't be a circus act. I think people should focus on the music and not the conductor you "

People who like it say it adds clarity and makes reading things easier. But organizations like the AP don't use it in their style book. They're what's technically known as...wrong. It's a heated debate. There's a whole Twitter account that just asked celebrities about their Oxford comma preferences — that's how we know Rob Lowe is ""pro"" and Van Der Beek thinks only ""animals"" would ditch the Oxford comma.

""So according to the OED, the first recorded use of this term is supposed to be Peter H. Sutcliffe's book from 1978.""

Collins wrote those rulebooks, codifying the punctuation that Lupita Nyong'o said she couldn't live without. But that's not all — Collins said he got the idea from a letter from Herbert Spencer, who thought the comma was key in ""marking out the elements of a thought."" And at the time, Herbert Spencer was a legend. Charles Darwin did not come up with the term ""survival of the fittest"" — Herbert Spencer did. Spencer was a classic Victorian generalist. He was a jack of all trades who did philosophy and science. In the 1860s, Darwin, Spencer, Thomas Huxley, and others all pushed evolution into the mainstream of culture. Here's Darwin and Spencer, just chattin'. Spencer's survival of the fittest expanded to social Darwinism, the competition between people, not just species. He was massively influential, selling hundreds of thousands of copies of his books and inspiring authors, like H.G. Wells's divergent races in ""The Time Machine."" But over time, his worldview lost to the competition. Darwin became the name people associated with evolution. Spencer turned into an often maligned figure in philosophy and a footnote to the culture at large. Social Darwinism became of a piece with eugenics in the popular culture. But Spencer really did believe in efficiency and clarity. Our culture and science have changed from a mutton-chopped Victorian's theories, but our sentences still need to be clear. And that's why the Oxford comma is still the right choice for my coworkers, Neil de Grasse Tyson and Adam Savage. Uh, comma please. OK, so what is the best argument against an Oxford comma. After all, there are people who don't like it, from the AP to Talib Kweli — who is the son of of an English professor. And they might say that the Oxford comma can't hide bad writing. So, for example, if you looked at our sentence in the beginning of the video and made ""copy editors"" singular, even an Oxford comma would make it look like Rob Lowe had a job at Vox which, sadly, he does not. I, however, have to side with Spencer, because in that letter to Collins he said that commas equal pauses. And when you have a list, you want a pause for each item, and only an Oxford comma can do that. So that hopefully will settle it and there will never be another argument about this ever again. There...yeah... "

Heracles awoke from the madness that had descended on him, only to see his hands red and slick, his body covered, and the walls of his house splashed with the blood of his family. In a fit of rage, which Hera, the jealous wife of Zeus, had cast upon him, he had slaughtered everyone he loved and held dear. So Heracles travelled to Delphi to ask how he might atone for his sin. And he was told to go to his cousin, King Eurystheus, and, for 12 years, complete whatever tasks he might ask. If he could achieve all that was asked of him, he would be redeemed in the eyes of the gods. Simple, right? Well, Eurystheus then laid out the 10 tasks for him: 1. Slay the Nemean lion 2. Vanquish the nine-headed Lernaean Hydra 3. Capture the Golden Hind of Artemis 4. Subdue the great erymanthian boar and  return with it alive 5. Clean the Aegean stables in a single day 6. Get rid of the man-eating birds of Stymphalia 7. Capture the father of the Minotaur, the Cretan Bull 8. Steal the horse of Diomedes 9. obtain the girdle of Hippolyta, Queen of the Amazons, and finally 10. Procure the cattle of the giant Geryon. Now, all of these are basically impossible. But who's going to let a little thing like that stop them? Certainly not Heracles. So he immediately set off, heading high into the mountains of Nemea, tracking the lion. He carried with him his sturdy bow and quiver of arrows. But as he passed an olive tree, he had a Great Hero Thought™ ""I'm not nearly armed-to-the-teeth enough, and you know what that tree would be good for? Hitting things. Ha ha! ""I should rip it out of the ground and hit things with it!"" And so he did. Then, once he was done deforesting the mountainside, he spied the lion, jaws dripping with the  remains of its last kill. He ducked down into a thicket, and as the beast passed, he loosed arrow after arrow into its tawny hide. But rather than sink deep, they merely bounced off, as though they had struck the stone of the mountain itself. The beast, now noticing Heracles, turned to him and sprung. But as it leapt, he struck it with the great olive tree club - struck it with such a blow that only a child of Zeus could make. Dazed, the lion fled back to its lair, but Heracles blocked its only escape. Casting aside his bow, he threw himself upon it, and with his bare hands, choked the creature to death. He then took his knife and tried to skin it. But no matter how sharp he made his blade, it simply wouldn't pierce the creature's impervious skin. After trying this for a while, Athena at last put in his mind the idea of using the Lion's own claws against it. And thus did he flay the lion and take its  hide to wear as armor. You know what, just to keep track, I'll write all this stuff on his character sheet... Ok, +1 lion-hide armor and Tree Club of Smacking. Great, loot accounted for! Where were we? Oh right. With the first task done, he set off with his nephew and charioteer, Iolaus, to hunt the second beast: the great Hydra, whose heads are immortal and whose mouths drip the deadliest venom. As they approached the swamp where it was said to live, they saw the devastation it had wrought. Fields were barren, and the people who it had not consumed hid, huddling in their houses. Then, high on a hill, they found the monster's lair, and Heracles sprang from his chariot, launching arrows of fire at the scaly beast. Its nine heads rose up, swaying and hissing, but the fire drove it back. At last, Heracles rushed the great serpent and pinned him with his bare arms. Then, one by one, he hacked off the heads. But for each one he severed, two grew in its place. Hail Hydra! To make matters worse, it was all like, ""Oh you got a sidekick? ""Well, I got a sidekick too!"" (except, you know, that was probably in all hisses) and a giant crab rose out of the swamp to start pinching Heracles as well. But it proved merely a distraction, because he crab-punted it out of the stratosphere and it actually became the constellation Cancer. But then Heracles was all like, ""Oh yeah? Well, my sidekick's got sick burns!"" cuing Iolaus to use burning brands and cauterize the Serpent's necks as Heracles severed each head. At last, the serpent lay slain at their feet. Then, seeing an opportunity for a sweet buff, Heracles dipped his arrows in the Hydra's  poisonous blood, rendering them deadly to any they even scratched. Ok, so poison arrows *also* added... Resourceful player, this one! The next task, though, would take a  completely different set of skills. For he was to catch, not kill, the golden-horned and iron-hoofed Hind of Artemis. For a year, he chased it, until at last, it lay down in exhaustion. But just as he was about to seize it, it got up and made one more dash. And seeing that it was about to escape, Heracles loosed an arrow and wounded it grievously. Then as he trussed it to take back, Artemis herself appeared before him in wrath. But Heracles, you see, simply explained his penance set out to him by the gods, and then Artemis healed the Hind and let  him take it with him. AKA, he rolled a nat-20 on persuasion. Next he had to subdue the great and terrible boar that had been terrorizing the Erymanthian countryside. But you know, on the way, he stopped at the house of Pholos the Centaur. Pholos welcomed him in and offered him food. But then Heracles asked if he could have  something to drink, too. 'Cause you know, if you give a Heracles a  cookie... you get the idea. Pholos told him that he did have one great vessel of wine given by Dionysus himself... but sadly, it was joint property of all of the centaurs and he feared to open it without them. But Heracles convinced him to break the seal. No sooner was this done than the other centaurs smelled the fumes of the precious wine and came racing towards Pholos's house. Then two of them, enraged, charged through the front door. Heracles grabbed flaming logs from the fireplace and hurled them at the attackers, driving them back. Then he grabbed his bow and charged them, loosing arrows at centaurs as he went. [arrow noise] An arrow had pierced through one of the centaurs he was chasing, and it hit Heracles's friend, Chiron, the wisest of the centaurs, in the knee. Chiron cried out, for the Hydra's venom made the wound fatal. Heracles raced over to aid his old friend. But no healing, not even the healing Chiron himself had taught him, was to any avail. However, Chiron was immortal, so the wound, though fatal to any mortal being, simply left him in perpetual agony. So at this point, Heracles could only do one thing for his old friend: promise to one day find a way for him to die. Then Heracles continued on his hunt. He drove the great boar into a snow field, and when it exhausted itself deep in the bank of snow, he threw a net over it and captured it alive. Though unfortunately, while he was doing this, Pholos had drawn one of the arrows out of a dead centaur, curious how such a small weapon could  wreak such harm. And in doing so, it slipped through his clumsy fingers and pierced his foot, killing him instantly. So in other words, he got distracted drinking with friends and then left a bunch of non-war-related collateral damage in his heroic wake. Now we're really starting to feel like an RPG. Up next was the task to clean the great  stables of Augeas, the man who owned the most cattle in all of Greece. When Heracles presented himself, he boasted to Augeas that he could clean his stable in a day, and Augeas, not knowing who he was talking to, laughed to himself and then offered Heracles a tenth of his herd if he could pull off such a feat, knowing full well that it was impossible. But when he went to watch Heracles work, rather than picking up a shovel, he saw Heracles rip up the very foundation of his stable, then divert two rivers to flow through it. And so in a night, his stable was clean. (Though not exactly in the state he desired.) Of course, there was a big court case about this, the upshot of which being that Heracles got paid in cows, but Augeas exiled his own son for being a snitch. Okay, so that's +200 cattle. Would I put that under inventory or currency in ancient Greece? Oh, sorry, you know what, character sheet updates can take forever. So I'll work on this until next time, when Heracles goes for the next five labors and maybe even a few bonus ones. Phat loot for days! Legendary thanks to patrons Amatzia Dirk and Kyle Murgatroyd. "
217,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,-CouQMh_PUo," Each night for a week, a group of artillerymen climbed the tower of St. Stephen's Cathedral. There they fire rocket after rocket, signaling their dire situation to the relief army they hoped was coming. Each day brought them closer to starvation, And each night they fought desperate battles in the moat by light of tar flames. But this night, a sparking rocket answers in the hills... the cavalry has arrived! (Extra History- Birth of the People) As the Defenders of Vienna fought their desperate defense, Emperor Leopold struggled to cobble together enough allies to relieve the city, because there was a problem in the Holy Roman Empire. See, it wasn't an empire in the same way the Ottoman Empire was, Leopold couldn't just call up troops. Instead, he had to convince the Imperial state that it was in their interest to help him. And that took money, and money was a problem. Because despite their opulence, the Habsburgs were chronically short on cash. (nice pantaloons) To get King John Sobieski of Poland-Lithuania to maintain his treaty obligations, He had to agree to fund the Polish relief force during all its operations outside of Poland, And therefore he was basically tapped out. Luckily, Leopold had an ally, Pope Innocent the Ninth, whose pet project was reconquering Catholic territory in Eastern Europe. That was his ""pet project""? Really??? I mean some people crochet, or bowl, or... I don't you know, you know what? Who am I to judge? The Pope poured vast amounts of money into Leopold's war chest, while spinning up a 17th century PR campaign to tout the relief of Vienna as a holy war. A decisive moment in the battle between Christianity and Islam. But not everyone was buying it, After all, Europe was stretched from the horrors of the 30 Years War, Where the Habsburgs had mercilessly slaughtered Protestants. And the biggest skeptic of this campaign was ""Louis XIV of France"", Who pointedly ignored the pope's call to join his new Holy League. Because, h e h  h e h, of course, he did! The Habsburgs were Louie's main political rival. He was actually encroaching on their western border So if they had to redirect troops to the east, huh, good (delightfully devilish). With France opting out of the Holy League, OOOOOOOOOOF Leopold turned to the states of the Holy Roman Empire, the ones that would be next if Vienna fell, Bavaria, Franconia, and even Protestant Saxony signed up, But coalition warfare is... complicated. First, these armies need time to form. Second, they move slow. It was mid August by the time they marched, and by then the commanders were riven over the questions that always crop up in coalition warfare, ""Who would lead?"" Leopold wanted to redeem himself after his embarrassing flight from Vienna, but everyone knew that was a bad idea, So Sobieski prevailed! Now, with that decided who would use which road cross? Which bridge? Enter towns first to gain the honor of the populace, And when they finally meet the ottomans in battle, who would command the right flank? Because everyone knows that role was always given to the most important person. Oh and cannons! They were dividing all those ""equally"" right? Every move was a conversation, councils and protocol feasts dragged long Things only began to shake out, when Lorraine, who had just finished turning back an Ottoman reinforcement army, met up with the Holy League command. Likable and suave, he proved the key ingredient in smoothing ruffled feathers and flattering big egos, He got everyone on the same page. Finally there was a plan, September 12th midnight Inside Vienna, defenders could see bonfires in the woods. The relief army had arrived! And Kara Mustafa knew he'd been betrayed Reports said Crimean Tartars that were to be his rearguard, had not engaged the relief force But even now he stubbornly refused to give up Vienna. As he marshaled to meet the Holy League, He kept a large force of his best troops, his Janissaries and elite cavalry in front of the walls. After all, he thought, this Holy League was nothing to fear. His army was large and far better trained. He wouldn't be distracted from the real prize. He would attack the relief force and the city simultaneously. The relief force outnumbered him, but he'd fortified a line of towns that forced the holy League to attack over bad ground. The terrain favored his light horseman. Then, at 4:00 am, he began harassing the far end of the Holy league's line. Arrows flew, Long-ranged Janissary muskets coughed dirty smoke. Kara Mustafa had chosen his moment well, The enemy was still deploying, their troops not in position, and they took the bait. The Germans began moving down from the heights, firing back ragged volleys, Lorraine galloped forward trying to call them back, The left wing of the holy leagues line had entered battle prematurely, And, to his shock, the center was following them... They couldn't move in a solid formation over the rough slope, instead, breaking them into little knots of men. Things were in chaos. In the broken ground around the valley, cut by Hills ridges and gullies, There was no way to keep command of an entire force. the farmlands that looked like neat fields on the map, were in fact vineyards. Their trellises provided obstacles that broke up the advance. All the while, Ottoman troops rained fire from each village. The Allied army moved forward in pieces, assaulting the strong points. Ottoman cavalry rushed the gaps in the ranks of the advancing infantry Holy League artillery unlimbered and opened fire... Cohesion disappeared in both armies, units fought not in coordination, but as individual companies Cavalry intermixed with infantry, dirty smoke blanketed the battlefield hiding both friend and foe. Fortress towns changed hands in attack and counter-attack. Lorraine galloped to the line, yelling at the men to close up, trying to keep some semblance of order and seal gaps. The day was sweltering, the hottest anyone could remember. Weapons became hot to the touch, and hours of firing left men's faces blackened from gunpowder. Sweat drew clear channels through the grime... By noon, the Holy League had captured two major towns and began to press forward toward a high bluff where the Banner of the Prophet, The symbol of the Ottoman headquarters, flew. But where were the poles? Sobieski's cavalry force had been the last to arrive in the heights of the previous night, making camp in darkness. and had yet to join the battle. In the early afternoon, Holy League infantrymen looked to their right and saw enormous plumes of dust rising above the ridge. The Polish cavalry was making its way slowly, Down to the flat ground where they could let loose. While in Vienna, men defended the wooden palisades they directed to cover the gaps in the wall. Ottoman attackers had tried to spring several mines, but desperate sallying parties swamped and diffused them at the last minute, Vienna was holding, but only barely... Outside the armies started to tire but, the League troops were fresh while the Ottomans were demoralized. Having spent two months in the meat grinder of siege warfare and camp diseases, some of the levies were starting to desert. AND THEN, the Polish heavy cavalry exited the forest The league's infantry greeted them with cheers. The Winged Hussars had finally arrived ready to smash directly into the enemy camp, But it takes a great deal of time to draw up thousands of cavalry Lance's horses and men and plate armor are no good unless they move forward in a block. Sobieski wanted to gauge their effectiveness, So he picked a hundred and twenty men to charge immediately as a vanguard, not many would come back, but it could hit the ottomans before they could mass forces to counter this new threat. The contingent powered forward. Wooden wings on the back of their horses clattering, Frightening the enemy mounts. And at the last moment, their lances dipped... and they plowed into the Ottoman line, carving a hole in their ranks. Dropping their shattered lances, they laid in with long swords and pistols. On the high ground, Kara Mustafa saw the Winged Hussar strike deep into his ranks. It was over. Once a larger cavalry formed, they could strike into his camp, cut him off from both Vienna and his retreat into Hungary. So, he retired. Escaping with the Banner of the Prophet, and his personal treasury, while dispatching messages for men in the trenches to abandon their positions. He did not want to witness. What would come next... The Holy League generals conferred, the infantry had won the day. The only question now was, whether to finish the Ottomans or wait until morning. They decided to finish them and Sobieski would land the killing blow. The king led the vanguard personally, 3,000 Winged Hussars charged down from the heights, with 15,000 lighter polish and german cavalry behind. The largest cavalry charge in history, seemed to turn the valley black The Lancers crashed into the rapidly dissolving Turkish defense then carried on with their four-foot swords. Those behind swung axes and maces, catching anyone unlucky enough to try and cover the armies retreat. This wasn't so much of a fight as it was a rout, the Polish and German cavalry swept through the fleeing Ottomans. Plunging into their abandoned camp and there they reigned in gorging themselves on the greatest spoils of the campaign. They looted diamonds and gold and set barrels of gunpowder alight for the sheer elation of watching them explode They would loot the Turkish camp for a week! Meanwhile, the German units reached the Ottoman trench works clearing them and taking the remaining Ottoman engineers prisoner. Not quite the same as finding diamonds for a week, but whatever (j-e-alous). Vienna had been relieved, and a new alliance formed. Over the next 16 years, this holy League would strike deep into Eastern Europe, Bringing Hungary and part of the Balkans back into the Habsburg sphere. And though no one knew it at the time, the Battle of Vienna would mark the turning point in the Ottoman expansion into Europe. Paving the way for the Austro-hungarian Empire and Kara Mustafa for his part was executed for his failure. The Habsburgs and Ottomans continued to fight for centuries, each Kingdom mirroring the other's decline. And in a final act of irony, which is a story for another time, They would in fact die together fighting on the same side (Best Bros) Their interests linked by the same geography they'd created in a war so long ago, A long ago battle ""The Siege of Vienna"".

218,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,-GsVhbmecJA,"Language is an essential part of our lives that we often take for granted. With it, we can communicate our thoughts and feelings, lose ourselves in novels, send text messages, and greet friends. It's hard to imagine being unable to turn thoughts into words. But if the delicate web of language networks in your brain became disrupted by stroke, illness, or trauma, you could find yourself truly at a loss for words. This disorder, called aphasia, can impair all aspects of communication. People who have aphasia remain as intelligent as ever. They know what they want to say, but can't always get their words to come out correctly. They may unintentionally use substitutions called paraphasias, switching related words, like saying ""dog"" for ""cat,"" or words that sound similar, such as ""house"" for ""horse."" Sometimes, their words may even be unrecognizable. There are several types of aphasia grouped into two categories: fluent, or receptive, aphasia and non-fluent, or expressive, aphasia. People with fluent aphasia may have normal vocal inflection but use words that lack meaning. They have difficulty comprehending the speech of others and are frequently unable to recognize their own speech errors. People with non-fluent aphasia, on the other hand, may have good comprehension but will experience long hesitations between words and make grammatical errors. We all have that tip-of-the-tongue feeling from time to time when we can't think of a word, but having aphasia can make it hard to name simple, everyday objects. Even reading and writing can be difficult and frustrating. So how does this language loss happen? The human brain has two hemispheres. In most people, the left hemisphere governs language. We know this because in 1861, the physician Paul Broca studied a patient who lost the ability to use all but a single word, ""tan."" During a postmortem study of that patient's brain, Broca discovered a large lesion in the left hemisphere now known as Broca's area. Scientists today believe that Broca's area is responsible in part for naming objects and coordinating the muscles involved in speech. Behind Broca's area is Wernicke's area near the auditory cortex. That's where the brain attaches meaning to speech sounds. Damage to Wernicke's area impairs the brain's ability to comprehend language. Aphasia is caused by injury to one or both of these specialized language areas. Fortunately, there are other areas of the brain which support these language centers and can assist with communication. Even brain areas that control movement are connected to language. FMRI studies found that when we hear action words, like ""run"" or ""dance,"" parts of the brain responsible for movement light up as if the body was actually running or dancing. Our other hemisphere contributes to language, too, enhancing the rhythm and intonation of our speech. These non-language areas sometimes assist people with aphasia when communication is difficult. So how common is aphasia? Approximately 1 million people in the U.S. alone have it, with an estimated 80,000 new cases per year. About one-third of stroke survivors suffer from aphasia making it more prevalent  than Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis, yet less widely known. There is one rare form of aphasia called primary progressive aphasia, or PPA, which is not caused by stroke or brain injury, but is actually a form of dementia in which language loss  is the first symptom. The goal in treating PPA is to maintain language function for as long as possible before other symptoms of dementia eventually occur. However, when aphasia is acquired from a stroke or brain trauma, language improvement may be achieved through speech therapy. Our brain's ability to repair itself, known as brain plasticity, permits areas surrounding a brain lesion to take over some functions during the recovery process. Scientists have been conducting experiments using new forms of technology, which they believe may encourage brain plasticity in people with aphasia. Meanwhile, many people with aphasia remain isolated, afraid that others won't understand them or give them extra time to speak. By offering them the time and flexibility to communicate in whatever way they can, you can help open the door to language again, moving beyond the limitations of aphasia. "
219,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,-p2lhxUqMMQ,"1809. Imperial forces have trapped China's largest pirate fleet in a bay. The government has 95 ships, 1200 cannons, 18,000 men and 4 Western vessels. But the Pirates have something  no number of ships will overcome. Cheng I Sao. Leader of the Pirate Confederation. By the time this is over, she will dictate terms to them. *intro* Let's go back a couple years. Cheng I, the first the leader of the Pirate Confederation is dead. Swept overboard in a typhoon. The commanders of the six fleets gather to choose their new leader. And those are some big shoes to fill. Cheng had been a good commander. He'd been with the Pirates in Vietnam where they'd served as privateers in a war that had transformed them from amateur bandits to a crack mercenary navy. And when the Vietnamese dynasty fell  and the Pirates were driven back to China, It was Cheng who founded their Confederation and made them the masters of the coast. From the Pearl River to the Gulf of Tonkin. What man could follow that? But when the fleet commanders  opened the floor, the first to speak is a woman. Six years prior she had been just another prostitute in the floating brothels of Canton, but now they know her  as Cheng I Sao. Which translates to Cheng's wife. And she has a proposal. She will lead this confederation. After all, though Cheng  had led the fleets, she managed the business operation. It was because of her that every salt merchant in Canton visited a pirate office to buy a safe passage before setting sail. Because of her they were rich and every one of them knew that Jiang had made strategy with her at his elbow. The commanders exchanged looks. The idea isn't absurd. In Confucian China women were barred from public life. But these men are all from poor floating villages along the coast. Things are different out there. If a fisherman dies, his widow takes over his boat. Why should this be any different? But Cheng  already had an heir. His adopted son  Cheung Po Tsai. And though  he was still young, the lad was a popular  and daring captain. Fearless in attack and blessed by the gods. His flagship was a floating pagoda filled with idols, priests and oracles. Madame Cheng had news though. Cheung Po had agreed to serve her as commander of her confederation's red flag fleet. This tipped the scale. The fleet commanders named  Cheng I Sao their leader. And to solidify her power,  she entered another strategic alliance. Within weeks, she and her adopted son were lovers. Madame Cheng got to work. Her first act was to strengthen her authority with a new legal code. The massive confederation, now numbering 70,000 pirates and over 1200 vessels had become disorderly. The pirates needed to remember that they were one organization, under one leadership. From now on, anybody who disobeyed orders would be beheaded. And all stolen property would be brought to a common trust until it could be distributed fairly. If a crew made a score, they would hand it over to an accountant. The captors would receive a 20% cut with the rest going to a confederation fund for provisions and repairs. The new code also prescribed death for raping a captive, stealing from common funds or going ashore without leave. Next, Cheng I Sao turned her attention  to her favorite subject; making the money. The confederation already had a stranglehold on the salt trade, but it was time to expand. She extended their protection racket  to all maritime traffic, including fishing junks and foreign opium ships. She also dispatched the fleet to systematically threaten villages. They had a choice; pay up, or burn down. And her treasure warehouses began to fill. The government tried to stop her, but the Qing emperors had neglected maritime policy for decades, to the point that China didn't have a modern professional navy. The government fleet was just garrison troops loaded onto fishing and merchant junks, the same vessels the pirates used. Madame Cheng's fleet, on the other hand, was a crack ambush force. Trained to hide until their prey drew close. Then, the fleet would sweep out of hiding. War junks opening up with cannons as small sampan loaded with spearmen  rushed into boarding range. These tactics sent fleet after fleet  of government junks to the bottom. But in January of 1808, the pirates killed  a provincial commander and Pe King couldn't ignore  the problem anymore. The Emperor dispatched a new official, Bai Ling, with orders to quell this coastal threat. And he arrived just in time. For months, Madame Cheng  had been planning an audacious operation. A full-scale invasion  of the Pearl River Delta, with its rich trading ports of Canton and Portuguese Macau. In July 1808 Cheng Po baited Kenton's  defensive fleet into battle, and annihilated it. Now the path to Canton lay open. For a full year, Madame Cheng sacked the Delta. Pirates extorted villages  and slaughtered whoever resisted, dragging off women and children as captives. Each depredation was bloodier  than the last. The Black Flag fleet killed 10,000 people in a single expedition. Soon, citizens of Canton could hear  pirate cannons on a daily basis. But the campaign was taking  a toll on Madame Cheng's fleet. Raids were getting more costly. Their opponent, Bai Ling, had sent soldiers to train the village militias. He'd also clamped down on their supply lines on shore, forcing them to live on caterpillars boiled with rice. And the military was getting tougher, too. Then, a British ship appeared, alongside 60 brand-new Chinese war junks. Bai Ling had stooped  to recruiting foreign aid. Usually Madame Cheng had no problem outmaneuvering Western ships, but in river fighting, there was no room to operate. Within a week, she'd been driven away from Canton. With her personal squadron heavily damaged, she left Cheang Po in charge and went back to her base at Lantau to make repairs. And that is where  Bai Ling caught her. In November 1809, Madame Cheng looked out  to see sails on the horizon. Four Portuguese ships. Her squadron had only a few vessels, largely boarding and scouting craft. Worse, most of her junks had beached for repair. She sent an order to every ship in the fleet. ""Send help."" Three days later, Cheang Po arrived  with the Red Flag fleet. He brought bad news though. The Black Flag fleet wasn't coming, and the enemy fleet had grown. 60 war junks, 35 fishing boats and four western ships. The pirates only had seven junks which they moored bow to stern, blocking the mouth of the bay. This was a trap. The government had wanted Cheang Po here. By threatening Madame Cheng, they had forced the pirates to withdraw from Canton entirely and gather all in one place. The Imperial Fleet began its first attack, circling in to fire, then retreating to reload. The barrage lasted two hours, until finally a pirate sampan got close enough to hurl torches onto a war junk, detonating its magazine and forcing  the enemy to withdraw. For days, Cheang Po burned incense  and prayed for a southerly wind. Twice the pirates marshalled for a counter-attack, and twice, the breeze turned against them. And then the fire ships came. 43 of them, two-by-two. Each vessel loaded with straw and explosives. The pirates, all moored together, were an easy target. It was a night of fire and gunpowder. Crackling ships drifted into the fleet, throwing sparks as barrels of powder exploded. But Madame Cheng and her captains kept calm, methodically staving off each vessel and towing it safely ashore. And then, a miracle. The smoke changed direction; a southerly wind sprang up, driving the last two fire ships back into the Imperial fleet. Madame Cheng ordered the beached junks towed out and made ready for sail. The next morning, they slipped the blockade with the wind behind them, using older vessels to shield the fleet from gunfire. In nine days of siege, Madame Cheng had lost only 40 men and completed her repairs without losing a single junk. It was a stunning victory. But it exposed a fault line  in the confederation. The Black Fleet had taken a pardon and defected. Over the next few months, the Red Fleet would find itself simultaneously fighting imperial forces, old allies and western ships. Madame Cheng realized that the confederation had reached its zenith. From here her power could only weaken. So she decided to take a pardon while she still had a strong negotiating position. She sent the government her terms: Her pirates would get full amnesty and keep their spoils. Her men would also have the option to join the army and receive funds to establish themselves. Finally, she and Cheang Po, now married, would retain a squadron of junks for use in the salt trade. The government balked. No punishment... for anyone?! They refused to allow that, and talks began to break down. So Madame Cheng ordered one last sweeping pillaging expedition to teach them the wisdom of compromise. Then, she landed at Canton and demanded to negotiate with Bai Ling in person. Her terms had not changed. Bai Ling caved on every point, but he refused to let the couple keep  a personal squadron. How could he allow infamous pirates  to maintain a fleet of ships? For days, he negotiated,  begged and wheedled. But Madame Cheng just threatens to go back to sea. So he gave in. Two weeks later, the red flag fleet surrendered at Macau. It consisted of 17,318 pirates, 226 junks and 1315 cannons. But, the rot remained. Madame Cheng went straight, or at least, as straight as an ex pirate can go, running a gambling house in Canton. But the Emperor failed to see the warning sign her career represented. He continued to neglect maritime policy, and showed no interest in creating a more capable navy. But what the Emperor ignored, others saw with perfect clarity. As Cheng's life waned, the British stepped up to the fault line she had exposed. 29 years after her surrender, a mere handful of British ships brought China to its knees, and the opium wars began. *outro* Subtitles brought to you by yours truly; Lee TF.

220,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,-tX34V_XGeQ,"This just in: ""Thief robs town  with world's largest chocolate bunny."" Wait, so are we talking about this, or this? That's a classic case of a misplaced modifier, a common grammatical mistake that can dramatically change  the meaning of a sentence. And lest you think this is a bit far-fetched, confusing headlines like this appear all the time. Modifiers are words, phrases, and clauses that add information about other parts of a sentence, which is usually helpful. But when modifiers aren't linked clearly enough to the words  they're actually referring to, they can create unintentional ambiguity. That happens because the modifying words, in this case, ""with world's largest chocolate bunny,"" modify the wrong thing, the robber's actions instead of the town. To correct this particular sentence, we simply rephrase to make it clearer what the modifying phrase is talking about. ""Town with world's largest chocolate bunny robbed by thief."" Now, at least it's clear that the thief wasn't armed with a giant chocolate animal. Sometimes, modifying words,  phrases, or clauses don't appear to be modifying  anything at all. That's called a dangling modifier. ""Having robbed the bank in record time, it was possible to make off  with the town's chocolate rabbit as well."" The modifying phrase in this sentence seems unrelated to anything else, and so we're clueless about who the chocolate-loving criminal could possibly be. Giving the modifier something to modify will solve the problem. Then there's another group called the squinting modifiers because they're stuck between two things and could feasibly refer to either. Often, these modifiers are adverbs, like the one in this sentence: ""Robbers who steal chocolate bunnies rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers."" ""Rapidly"" is the modifier, here, but what's not clear is whether it's referring to the speed of the chocolate thievery, or how quickly it alerts the furious onlookers. To clarify, we can either put the modifier closer to its intended phrase, which works in some cases, or we can entirely reword the sentence so that the modifier no longer squints, but clearly applies to only one part. ""Chocolate bunny-thieving robbers rapidly attract the outrage of onlookers."" Justice will eventually come to the chocolate thief, but in the meantime, our task is to avoid verbal ambiguity by making it clear which parts of the sentences modifiers belong to. That way, we can at least maintain grammatical law and order. "
221,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,0Pf6PMSB8uo,"The empire is crumbling. Rome has been fractured, separated into three states. The west is desperately trying to hold the borders of Gaul, the east is being overrun by the Sassanids, the Rhine provinces are in disarray. In the center, Italy alone stands. The year is 260 AD, the emperor Valerian has marched East with an army of 70,000 legionaries to push back the Sassanids and regain control of the economic heart of the empire. Plague has struck. Disease travels like a hurricane through the camp. Legionaries are sick, dying, laid low... And the Sassanids, the mighty new form of the Persian Empire, have come to deliver the coup de grace. The armies met near a town called Edessa in Cappadocia, now southern Turkey. Outmatched, weighed down by sickness, the Romans don’t stand a chance. The battle turns into a rout, then a massacre. Not one man escapes. The emperor meets with the Sassanids to discuss terms, but during parley he is betrayed and taken prisoner. For the first and only time in the history of Rome, an emperor is made captive on the field of battle. The shockwaves from this event are immense. The emperor is not dead, but he’s also not ruling, so... who’s running the empire? Imperium breaks down. The East is left devoid of legions, the Sassanids are rampaging through Roman territory, no army within a thousand miles stands to oppose them. Complete collapse is imminent. But despite all of this, the East would stand for 1200 more years, a bulwark to the West. What prevented its collapse? What allowed the legacy of Rome to last long enough to be passed down to those who would help shape the Renaissance, and thus the modern age? A little known Palmyrene prince named Odenathus. Palmyra was an oasis town just at the fringes of the Roman Empire, in modern day Syria. It was unusual because, although it was technically within Roman territory, it was allowed to continue operating as an independent city, with its own government and even its own military. It lay right across the Silk Road and was one of the most important reprovisioning stops for caravans moving goods from Asia to Rome. So as Roman wealth grew, so did the wealth of Palmyra, and by the second century, it was a monument of classical city building. It had great temples and amphitheaters, statues and a massive roadway that was flanked on either side by monumental columns. Hidden among the desert dunes, this was a city to rival perhaps any in the west besides Rome itself. As the city prospered, so too did its citizens, and soon they clamored for the rights and honors afforded to all prosperous Romans. By the start of the third century, the city was named a Colonia, the highest status the Romans could give a city, and its most notable citizens were acknowledged as equals in rank, if not of lineage, to Senators. One such citizen was Lucius Septimius Odenathus. His family, having been granted Roman honors by Septimius Severus, had long been one of the leading families of Palmyra. At the time our story begins, the time of Valerian’s ill-fated expedition to the east, Odenathus was serving as Exarch (governor) of Palmyra. As Rome and the Sassanid Empire came to blows, Odenathus realized that this could mean nothing good for his desert city state. At first he tried to remain neutral, but after the disaster outside of Edessa, he realized that neutrality was impossible. He would have to choose a side. The king of the Sassanids, Shapur, with no Roman force left to oppose him, clearly aimed to annex Palmyra, so Odenathus decided to cast the die and throw his lot fully in with beleaguered and dying Rome. And here is where history turns. As the invincible Sassanid army returned from ravaging the eastern Roman Empire, laden with booty and captives, tramping through the desert a thousand miles from the nearest army that could stand against them, a strange thing happened. The vanguard saw dark shapes upon the dunes, thousands of them, men outlined by the sun. Before they could even raise the cry, this phantom desert army was upon them, tearing through their lax and ill formed lines. This Sassanid army, the army that no legion could stand against, that had savaged the eastern empire unopposed and come within a hair's breadth of annexing all of the eastern provinces of Rome, was gone in an instant, ruined by these ghosts of the desert, scattered like windblown sand. And this mirage army, seemingly conjured from the desert itself? This was the army of Odenathus. It was a last stand. Here the Eastern Roman Empire would live or die, and Palmyra with it. Odenathus, when he had heard of the Roman defeat, had known that this was his only chance, the only chance, at holding off the Sassanids. He had pulled together every troop his city state could muster, he had gathered what remnants of the Roman legions he could find scattered in the desert and had armed his peasantry to make his stand. And then he descended on the Sassanids with fury, like the howling desert winds. From here he moved like lightening. He marched north to defend the legitimate Roman Emperor, the son of Valerian, from pretenders from the east. Then south to smash the now hobbled Sassanids. He came to the very gates of the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon twice, and his patchwork army of peasants, legionnaires, and soldiers of Palmyra liberated province after province, bringing them back into the Empire. His desert army soon became the most feared in the east, and he personally ruled a kingdom that spanned from Anatolia to the Levant. But he never rebelled. Unlike so so many in this time, he never named himself Emperor or Augustus - though he perhaps controlled more land and a more impressive army than the emperor of Rome. And for this, he was granted titles extraordinary in all of Roman history. He was elevated to Dux Romanorum, or Leader of the Romans, and then Corrector Totius Orientis, the Righter of the East, and then finally Rex Regum or King of Kings. This last one was a bit of a dig at the Sassanids, whose customary title for their leader was “King of Kings”. This was Odenathus and the Romans telling the Sassanids who was now the real boss in the middle east. Yet still, despite being made King of Kings, he considered himself a servant of Rome and faithfully defended the Roman borders in the east, bringing back into the fold the provinces that had slipped away during the third century crisis, until his death in 267. Would he have, with the passage of many more years, eventually declared himself emperor and created a new empire from the now massive part of the East he controlled for the Rome? We’ll never know, because as he rode to Cappadocia to quell an incursion of Goths, he went hunting with his nephew and son. He told his nephew to leave the hunting party, because of some act of rudeness, and while this nephew waited out his time away from the group, he stewed and stewed… At the next great feast, he killed both Odenothus and his heir. And like that, history turns again. With no heir of age left, Odenothus’ wife, Zenobia, actually did take that final step and declared herself empress of what she called the Palmyrene Empire and for this Zenobia really deserves her own episode someday. But by the time she declared this Palmyrene Empire, her late husband had bought Rome enough time to recover and regain its footing. And a newly reforged Rome would make sure that the Palmyrene Empire was not long for this world. And with its fall Rome would, at last, fully reintegrated the east. So how much long term difference did this one Arabian prince choosing to fight for Rome and pulling together an army out of an oasis town really make? Well, consider this: it’s entirely plausible that, without Odenathus’s actions, Eastern Rome would have disappeared forever right here. And without Eastern Rome, the Roman Empire as a whole would pretty much be over. Now, it’s true that the Roman empire would still collapse 200 years later, but those 200 years of Roman existence have had an enormous impact on Western culture. If nothing else, consider just this one fact: this all happened in the year 260. 130 years before Christianity was named the official religion of the Roman Empire. Who knows what would have happened if this little known noble in the middle of the desert hadn’t decided to stand for Rome? How different would today’s world be? For better or worse, this one prince’s decision may well have helped to lead to the profound impact Christianity would have on history for thousands of years to come. History so often hinges on these small events. "
222,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,0TipTogQT3E,"In 2008, something incredible happened: a man was cured of HIV. In over 70 million HIV cases,  that was a first and, so far, a last. We don't yet understand exactly how he was cured. We can cure people of various diseases, such as malaria and hepatitis C, so why can't we cure HIV? Well, first let's examine  how HIV infects people and progresses into AIDS. HIV spreads through  exchanges of bodily fluids. Unprotected sex and contaminated needles are the leading cause of transmission. It, fortunately, cannot spread through air, water, or casual contact. Individuals of any age, sexual orientation, gender and race can contract HIV. Once inside the body, HIV infects cells that are part of the immune system. It particularly targets helper T cells, which help defend the body against bacterial and fungal infections. HIV is a retrovirus, which means it can write its genetic code into the genome of infected cells, co-opting them into making  more copies of itself. During the first stage of HIV infection, the virus replicates within helper T cells, destroying many of them in the process. During this stage, patients often  experience flu-like symptoms, but are typically  not yet in mortal danger. However, for a period ranging from a few months to several years, during which time the patient may look and feel completely healthy, the virus continues to replicate and destroy T cells. When T cell counts drop too low, patients are in serious danger of contracting deadly infections that healthy immune systems can normally handle. This stage of HIV infection is known as AIDS. The good news is there are drugs that are highly effective at managing levels of HIV and preventing T cell counts  from getting low enough for the disease to progress to AIDS. With antiretroviral therapy, most HIV-positive people can expect to live long and healthy lives, and are much less likely to infect others. However, there are two major catches. One is that HIV-positive patients  must keep taking their drugs for the rest of their lives. Without them, the virus can make a deadly comeback. So, how do these drugs work? The most commonly prescribed ones prevent the viral genome from being copied and incorporated into a host cell's DNA. Other drugs prevent the virus from maturing or assembling, causing HIV to be unable to infect new cells in the body. But HIV hides out somewhere our current drugs cannot reach it: inside the DNA of healthy T cells. Most T cells die shortly after  being infected with HIV. But in a tiny percentage, the instructions for building more HIV viruses lies dormant, sometimes for years. So even if we could wipe out every HIV virus from an infected person's body, one of those T cells could activate and start spreading the virus again. The other major catch is that not everyone in the world has access to the therapies that could save their lives. In Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for over 70% of HIV patients worldwide, antiretrovirals reached only about one in three HIV-positive patients in 2012. There is no easy answer to this problem. A mix of political, economic and cultural barriers makes effective prevention  and treatment difficult. And even in the U.S., HIV still claims more than 10,000 lives per year. However, there is ample cause for hope. Researchers may be closer than ever to developing a true cure. One research approach involves using a drug to activate all cells  harboring the HIV genetic information. This would both destroy those cells and flush the virus out into the open, where our current drugs are effective. Another is looking to use genetic tools to cut the HIV DNA  out of cells genomes altogether. And while one cure out of 70 million cases may seem like terrible odds, one is immeasurably better than zero. We now know that a cure is possible, and that may give us what we need to beat HIV for good. "

How they seem to get less and less accessible and more and more focused on the things that only the top 1% of players seem to like Well there's a lot of reasons for that, but a surprisingly common one is because game companies end up... ...implementing a hiring practice that sounds good on the surface, but ends up shooting them in the foot They only hire their fans Big thanks to our sponsor for this episode Skillshare, the first 500 people to sign up with the link below get their first 2 months free *woosh* Games get more inaccessible, more hardcore, and more focused on the top tier players over time for all sorts of reasons Sometimes it's because only the hardest-core players are still playing, and thus, still paying So, instead of risking everything on trying to bring in new players... ...companies focus on creating content for the people they know will buy it Other times, it's because the designers box themselves into a corner and limit their design space in such a way... ...that they have to keep making the existing elements of the game more complex rather than more expansive And sometimes, it's just because of accretion But one of the lesser-known reasons is because companies often insist on hiring designers who are fans of their games already I've seen a lot of job postings that require a designer to have at least 500 hours played, have three max level characters, or be platinum But that's actually not what you want if you want to keep your game fresh and accessible You actually want people on the team that don't already think your game is great At first glance, this may seem weird I mean, don't you want people with tons of experience with your game to carry on the design? Well, yes... ...but they can't be the only ones The problem with people who are already fans of a game is that they don't see anything fundamentally wrong with it They see all sorts of small nitpicks... ...places where things could be tightened up or where their favorite systems could be built out to even greater depth But they don't see the big flaws, the stuff that in time will cut you from an audience you might never have known you could have had And this sort of fan designer is also so far removed from the new player experience, it can be hard for them to fully understand it Ever introduce a friend to a game that you think is simple... ...only to find out that you're just so used to all of the weird or complex things in it that you don't even think about them anymore? But as soon as your friend jumps in, it's like hitting a brick wall for them Well, you don't want your designers replicating that experience as they build the onboarding for your game You don't want the people who are so used to pressing ctrl J as a hotkey... ...that they forget that that would be a terrible hotkey for almost anything in a game *Meow* Sorry, Zoe. I know. It's just the Dwarf Fortress rage kicking in I digress And sometimes when you're a hardcore player, you get so used to things, even bad counterintuitive ones... ...that when those things change, they feel worse You don't want that very natural bias in your designers And just to be clear when I'm talking about fan designers... ...I don't mean that companies are just hiring random fans These people are totally qualified game designers with titles shipped and years of experience under their belt They just also happen to be people the company requires to be fans of the game And having some of these is good You want people who have a lot of experience playing your game working on it You just don't want them to be the predominant voice on your design team Because a professional can like working on a game without being a total fan of the game itself In much the same way that an architect can enjoy the challenge of designing a building that they'd never want to live in themselves And all of these natural biases of your fan designers are actually compounded by the fact... ...they're prone to listen to the most hardcore fans themselves Not out of anything sinister But simply because those are the voices that are going to most resonate with them... ...and that probably echo their own concerns These fan designers tend to be the most susceptible to listening to the design complaints of E-Sports pros or the hardest core sections of the forums... ...and use those complaints to justify design decisions And again, this isn't entirely bad Someone should be listening to those players, because it's always important to keep your top end game healthy and vibrant But you also need people there to reign in those decisions and point out when they're costing you the rest of your player base A game that's a personal favorite of mine, Starcraft 2, is probably the most notable example of this But gaming is littered with examples of fan designers making choices to satisfy the hardest-core of the fan community This stifles change, prevents your game from adapting with the times, and makes it less accessible to a new audience At the end of the day, it all comes down to this. All design decisions should be made with intent There are lots of reasons why a company might choose to focus on their hardcore fanbase Those reasons may not be the ones that everyone always likes, but they're often still very valid But it's when a game just sort of lists towards being inaccessible and hardcore... ...because there's no one left on the team that can see there are alternatives... ...that there are other decisions that could be made Being great at a game shouldn't be a qualification for helping to design it Instead in your interviews, you should ask how much your potential designers have played your game... ...and then have them explain why that will help you craft your design Until next time, everyone Once again, thank you Skillshare for sponsoring this episode They're a fantastic resource for learning and one of the most affordable learning platforms around When I first took my deep dive into their classes I learned about logo design, portrait photography, and how to make some very tasty meatballs The first 500 that sign up with the link in the description below get their first two months free So go check them out and tell them Extra Credits sent you "

Charles hopes to find succour within the Ottoman Empire. But Peter is hard on his heels. Nearly starving, suffering from the heat, the remaining Swedes raced South until they arrived at the very border of the Black Sea. But as the local prince haggled over prices for boats to ferry them into the Ottoman Empire, Peter overtook the Swedish Rear Guard. Eight hundred were lost. Only five hundred remained. But those five hundred made their way into the Sultanate. There, they were treated regally. Given food and drink, even allowed to set up an almost autonomous colony, which the Ottomans helped them to build. But Peter did not relent. As his forces approached the border of the Empire, he demanded that Charles be handed over. The Sultan, who was no friend of the Russians, refused. So Peter decided to force the issue. He would bring war to the Ottoman Empire itself. His army, augmented by forces from Moldovia, plunged towards Pluth River. Where they were rapidly cut off by the giant home army of the Ottoman Empire. For a moment, it looked as though Peter and his entire force might fall into the Sultan's hands. But where Peter and his subordinates clearly lost the war, you might argue that they had won the peace. Deftly using diplomacy to extricate his army, Peter was allowed to leave the Ottoman territory with his army intact, for little more than an agreement to give Charles safe passage back to Sweden, and a handful of very minor territorial concessions. But this was not good enough for Charles. He pushed the Sultan to make war on the Russians. The Sultan had no interest in such a costly project. He was basically like, ""We won you the right to go home, man, just go home."" Charles then decided to be the ultimate bad house guest, and declared: ""Alright, I live HERE now."" To which the Sultan replied, *Sigh* ""Dude, come on."" And Charles responded, ""I WILL cut you."" At which point, the Sultan, in his infinite patience, said, ""Look, I will give you ten thousand pounds, if you will just leave."" Charles took this payment, and then like any bad house guest, said, ""Alright, I WILL leave..."" ""...IF you give me 8,000 more."" At which point, the Sultan was like, ""Okay, time to call the sheriff."" Before remembering, ""Oh wait, I'M the sheriff."" And then promptly surrounded Charles' small force and threw him into jail. After cooling his heels for a while, Charles was, at last, allowed to return to Sweden. And it was at this point that Good 'Ol Augustus the Strong, deposed King of Poland, returns to the spotlight. After having a good long think, he had finally decided, ""Y'know, I have heard good things about 'winning.' New plan, let's try that."" He was super excited about this plan (and I mean, why wouldn't he be? It's a pretty solid plan). Anyway, he proceeded to basically roll Swedish forces back to the very borders of Polish-Lithuanian territory, Then, after a heroic last effort from the Swedish troops, he bottled them up in a fortress in Holstein-Gottorp. And when no aid came to save them, he forced them to surrender. The last truly major army of the Swedes had vanished. So the dominoes began to fall. Russia, Norway, and Poland-Lithuania were already at war with Sweden. Those who had fallen out of the alliance due to previous defeats were now back in. Then, the King of England got into the mix under his other title as Elector of Hanover, and then, so did Prussia. So at this point, Sweden is basically at war with all of Northern Europe. Their resources are tapped, and the great armies that had swept them to empire were now shattered or imprisoned. But Charles was not deterred. Never one to surrender, never one to make peace, he raised what forces he could, and kicked off a campaign in Norway. And this began pretty well. He cut his way through the thin Danish-Norwegian defenses, threatening to overwhelm the knife at the back of Sweden. But then, disaster struck in the Baltic. Norwegian naval forces ambushed the Swedish fleet, nearly wiping it out. This left Charles unable to resupply, and he was forced to retreat once again. Meanwhile, in Finland (Which was part of Sweden at the time), the Russians had invaded. Initially, the going was slow. The Russians were impeded by poor roads and bad weather, But Peter, with his love of ships, settled on a new course of action, one where the Russian offensive would be centered on the coastline, where men and material could be rapidly be transferred by sea. The Swedish commander in Finland was continually on the retreat, having neither the men nor the supplies necessary to contest the Russians. For this, he was recalled and replaced with a man who was much more likely to agree to the native Finns' demand for a fight. And fight they did, twice. But long gone were the days when Swedish forces could beat the Russians 8:1, or even 2:1. The Swedish army in Finland was almost made up entirely of Finnish troops, not the Swedish core who had done so much at the outset of the war, only to be eventually wiped out in Russia. This Finnish army was beaten back both times. This all occurred just before the Swedish navy got stomped outside of Norway, (And I'm sorry for how confusing all these timelines are, but at this point, everything is kinda happening at once.) The Swedish fleet was sent out to help the Finnish forces, to take some of the pressure off, but Peter, great lover of sailing ships that he was, ironically used a fleet of galleys to blaze past them on a day in which the sea was calm. Soon, the Finnish front was untenable, and what troops were left were recalled to defend Sweden itself. But Charles was not yet done. He planned a return to Norway. He knew there was exactly one hope. He needed to capture the fortress of Frederiksten, the very same place he had just lost his fleet failing to capture. He raised another 22,000 men for his last attempt to turn things around. Their campaign in Norway was hard-going, always in want of rations, having to swim across rivers, or climb whole mountains to achieve the positioning that Charles wanted. But despite this suffering, Swedish discipline won out. And through this privation, The army had never truly wavered, because they had always the example of their king, who always took the roughest tasks for himself. By November 1718, they made it to the fortress. Charles himself led an assault on the outer works and overwhelmed them with his loyal grenadiers. Things were progressing nicely, but now the fortress had to be breached. On the 30th of November, Charles went to inspect the trenchworks, laughing and joking with the men, He encouraged them in their work. Then, as night fell, The defenders put burning wreathes on the fortress wall to illuminate the surrounding ground. The king suspected that they might sortie out and try to smash the progress made on the siegeworks, before returning to the safety of their fort. So he climbed to the lip of the trench to get a better look. A nearby French officer (who had just joined the Swedes) called out to him, ""That is no fit place for your majesty. Musket balls and cannonballs have as little respect for the king as for the common soldier."" The king simply responded: ""Don't be afraid."" And one of the common Swedish officers told the Frenchmen, ""Eh, let him be. The more you warn him, the more he'll expose himself."" The moon now washed the whole battlefield in a pale light. Soldiers worked, officers directed, and then, there was a soft wet sound. No louder than that of a rock gently dropped into a pool... The king was dead. A shot had passed through his left temple and out the right. He died where he lay: right at the top of the trenchworks. The succession passed to his sister, but the spirit of the army was gone. A retreat was made, and preparations to defend the homeland began. But defense was only a dream. From 1719 to 1721, Sweden suffered brutal raids and incursions from the Russians, until, at last, they were forced to make peace. Sweden had to cede almost all of its territory (Except for the home country itself and Finland. Which, after an occupation known as ""The Great Wrath"", the Russians agreed to leave be). The grand dream of Charles...was smashed. And with it, the Swedish Empire. Sweden would never again rise to such a position of prominence on the world stage. But as Charles' dream lay in ruins, Peter's became a reality. Russia pushed westward, gaining ports along the Baltic coast. More importantly, they proved that they were a power on the rise. That no longer could calculations about European politics be made... ...without factoring the Russians in. Thus, the Great Northern War ends. And the wheel turns as one empire falls... ...and another rises. [Music] "
225,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,0xnzGSV66x4,"There's a job out there with a great deal of power, pay, prestige, and near-perfect job security. And there's only one way to be hired: get appointed to the US Supreme Court. If you want to become a justice on the Supreme Court, the highest federal court  in the United States, three things have to happen. You have to be nominated by the president of the United States, your nomination needs to be approved by the Senate, and finally, the president must formally appoint you to the court. Because the Constitution doesn't specify any qualifications, in other words, that there's no age, education, profession, or even native-born  citizenship requirement, a president can nominate any individual to serve. So far, six justices have been foreign-born, at least one never graduated from high school, and another was only 32 years old when he joined the bench. Most presidents nominate individuals who broadly share their ideological view, so a president with a liberal ideology will tend to appoint liberals to the court. Of course, a justice's leanings are not always so predictable. For example, when President Eisenhower, a Republican, nominated Earl Warren for Chief Justice, Eisenhower expected him to make conservative decisions. Instead, Warren's judgements have gone down as some of the most liberal in the Court's history. Eisenhower later remarked on that appointment as ""the biggest damned-fool mistake""  he ever made. Many other factors come up for consideration, as well, including experience, personal loyalties, ethnicity, and gender. The candidates are then thoroughly vetted down to their tax records and payments to domestic help. Once the president interviews  the candidate and makes a formal nomination announcement, the Senate leadership traditionally turns the nomination over to hearings by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Depending on the contentiousness of the choice, that can stretch over many days. Since the Nixon administration, these hearings have averaged 60 days. The nominee is interviewed  about their law record, if applicable, and where they stand on key issues to discern how they might vote. And especially in more recent history, the committee tries to unearth any dark secrets or past indiscretions. The Judiciary Committee votes to send the nomination to the full Senate with a positive  or negative recommendation, often reflective of political leanings, or no recommendation at all. Most rejections have happened when the Senate majority has been a different political  party than the president. When the Senate does approve, it's by a simple majority vote, with ties broken by the vice president. With the Senate's consent, the president issues  a written appointment, allowing the nominee to complete the final steps to take the constitutional  and judicial oaths. In doing so, they solemnly swear to administer  justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor and the rich and faithfully and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon a US Supreme Court justice. This job is for life, barring resignation, retirement, or removal from the court by impeachment. And of the 112 justices who have held the position, not one has yet been removed from office as a result of an impeachment. One of their roles is to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans, even as different parties take power. With the tremendous impact of this responsibility, it's no wonder that a US Supreme Court justice is expected to be, in the words of Irving R.

227,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,1wZphSHtnAg,"This is a win chart. It's used in games to describe what percentage chance each player has to win at any given point during play This is a poll. It is used to give people an idea of who's going to win an election They might look the same but they are very different. [Intro music] Let's start by looking at a win chart. This is a win chart for a simple best-of-three coin-flip game. We start out with an equal chance of winning. If I win the first flip then I have a 75% chance because my odds of winning best-of-three are greatly increased. But then if you win the next flip we're back to 50-50. It's anybody's game. Next coin flip wins. So that was a win chart. Now here is a tracking Poll done over the last few months of the 2016 election. At first glance, this looks very much like the win chart - it's got a lot of numbers, and each candidate's odds of winning seem to fluctuate over time, just like in our coin flip game Now, I'm going to spend the rest of this episode explaining why win charts and polls are different, but, There is one area where they have very similar effects, That area, is Heuristics Heuristics, are rules of thumb for particular systems. Some examples of heuristics in gaming would be: ""Never draw to an inside straight"" Or, ""Shift your infield to the left against right handed hitters."" As players learn more of a system's heuristics, they get better at whatever the system is, And politics, naturally, have heuristics as well Heuristics comes in 2 type: Strategic and Positional. Strategic Heuristics are long term plans that you try to implement over the course of the game like Establish the running game early to open up the passing game later. Or in politics, lock down super delegates early to discourage competitors. Positional Heuristics, on the other hand, are based on specific situations that may arise during a game like: Knowing to bring in a relieve pitcher. Or in politics, knowing that when you get caught in a scandal, you should have spouse standing at your side for a while, and use a lot of Christian sounding terms like Forgiveness. Now, some games produce win charts that are clear to the players like that straight forward coin flip sample from earlier. But often it's a lot trickier for players to figure out clear precise win charts for the game they're playing. And we call this uncertainty ""Fuzziness"". That fuzziness comes from complexity, randomness, playing against human who don't act consistently, and having some information that's not available to all players. In politics, win charts can sometimes be fairly clear. For example, a good party whip would know exactly  how many congressional votes they can count on for an upcoming vote. But political win charts can also be extraordinarily fuzzy. Particularly when it comes to elections. Knowing where you are on a win chart is critical information for Positional Heuristics. If you don't know how close the game is, you could easily apply the wrong Heuristics to your current situation . And unfortunately, polls are really the only tool candidates have to measure who's currently ahead. Which brings me to my main point: Knowing where you are in the polls is NOT the same as knowing where you are on a win chart. Political candidates generally use polling information as a substitute for a win chart in order to deploy a Positional Heuristics to their current situation. Toward the end of the 2016 US Presidential election, the poll showed Hillary Clinton having a comfortable lead, so she deployed the standard Positional Heuristics for what you do when you are ahead. Her campaign actions were an incredibly logical deployment of Heuristics The only problem was she wasn't actually ahead. Meanwhile, using that same polling information, the Donald Trump campaign followed the Heuristics for what to do when you are losing. You solidify your base, so even if you lose you at least retain political relevance post-election. Now it's easy for us to look at the results of this election in hindsight and say that the winning was brilliant in their strategy. While the loser made a bunch of stupid mistakes, but the truth is the last election both candidates were following standard Positional Heuristics. Had they known their actual positions on the win chart, you can be sure they both would acted very differently. This is what the actual win chart would have looked like the day before the election. At that point the campaigns had already been run and the voters had made up their minds. You could have run that election day 100 times and the outcome would not change. Donald Trump may have been behind in the polls, but it turned out he was way ahead on the win chart. And the only thing that could possibly swung the election at this point would have been something truly unusual. So okay, how exactly is polling different from a win chart? WEll, let's look at the win chart for a baseball game. Here is what the chart looks like when a team is up 1 to 0 at the end of the first inning. And here is what that win chart looks like when the team is up 1-0 with just one inning left to play. See? Even though the score is the same, the win chart is much decisive towards the end Because there's less variability left. The losing team only has one more inning to turn things around. And the chart reflects their diminishing chances. This is something that polls just aren't able to capture. No matter how close you get to the election, the polls won't look anymore decisive than they appeared near the beginning. And polls have lots of others systemic issues that can make them far less reliable than they might seem. Many of these issues are the same problems that exists in win charts. Imperfect information, randomness, complexity, all of that stuff. But the bigger problems are baked into how the polls are collected. Factors like sample size, question format, the subset of people being polled, self-selective reporting, all of these systemic effects make it so that even with multiple polls to work with, polling can never quite function as a win chart. So given all of that: why do campaigns based their Heuristics on polling? Well, because polling is often the only measure campaigns have to build their relative positions. It's not great, but it's the best they got. That said polls also have a powerful effect on voters. And their positional Heuristics. If Hillary Clinton supporters knew just how far behind she actually was on the win chart toward the end of that election, many of them probably would have acted differently. Volunteering, giving money, actually voting. And Donald Trump supporters would have acted differently, too if they knew that he was way ahead. Now, games evolve over time I expect that either we eventually get better at removing the fuzziness from political win charts Or new Heuristics would be implemented to better adapt to that fuzziness. Either way it's important for us to look at polls as just 1 data point when we decided how to best engage politically. It is easy to see why people put so much stock in polls though On the surface, they can seem to accurate which links us to asking ""Why do voters trust them so much?"" If a poll comes out and says that party A is ahead 60-40 with a 4% margin of error Many people read that as 4% Margin of Error? HOT Dang! It's almost mathematically impossible for party A to lose. Sadly, that is not what Margin of Error means in this case. What is actually means is if we do this poll again, using the exact same process, our next result will likely be within 4% of this result And margin of error doesn't take into account the systemic issues with polls Or all the time between now and election day. And on top of that, a lot of people subconsciously assumed that polls stack. Meaning that if you're ahead in more than 1 poll, or if you're ahead in the same poll consistently overtime, then the polls must be more closely reflecting the win chart! And I mean, that's understandable mistake to make. Consistency implies predictability in so many parts of out life. Alas, it does not work that way for polls Because polls suffers from systemic effects and those effects impacts polls in a similar way each time the poll's done. Now don't get me wrong, polls can be incredibly useful political tools. Particularly the nitty-gritty details that campaigns use for micro targetting which rarely gets reported on the news. There's also some great math that goes on with the polls. And with poll aggregaters, but for national campaigns, they can terrible guides for positional Heuristics. "
228,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,1yv_MXNYbAo,"Ani stands before a large golden scale where the jackal-headed god Anubis is weighing his heart against a pure ostrich feather. Ani was a real person, a scribe from the Egyptian city of Thebes who lived in the 13th century BCE. And depicted here is a scene from his Book of the Dead, a 78-foot papyrus scroll designed to help him attain immortality. Such funerary texts were originally written only for Pharaohs, but with time, the Egyptians came to believe regular people could also reach the afterlife if they succeeded in the passage. Ani's epic journey begins with his death. His body is mummified by a team of priests who remove every organ except the heart, the seat of emotion, memory, and intelligence. It's then stuffed with a salt called natron and wrapped in resin-soaked linen. In addition, the wrappings are woven with charms for protection and topped with a heart scarab amulet that will prove important later on. The goal of the two-month process is to preserve Ani's body as an ideal form with which his spirit can eventually reunite. But first, that spirit must pass through the duat, or underworld. This is a realm of vast caverns, lakes of fire, and magical gates, all guarded by fearsome beasts - snakes, crocodiles, and half-human monstrosities with names like ""he who dances in blood."" To make things worse, Apep, the serpent god of destruction, lurks in the shadows waiting to swallow Ani's soul. Fortunately, Ani is prepared with the magic contained  within his book of the dead. Like other Egyptians who could afford it, Ani customized his scroll to include the particular spells, prayers, and codes he thought his spirit might need. Equipped with this arsenal, our hero traverses the obstacles, repels the monsters' acts, and stealthily avoids Apep to reach the Hall of Ma'at, goddess of truth and justice. Here, Ani faces his final challenge. He is judged by 42 assessor gods who must be convinced  that he has lived a righteous life. Ani approaches each one, addressing them by name, and declaring a sin he has not committed. Among these negative confessions, or declarations of innocence, he proclaims that he has not made anyone cry, is not an eavesdropper, and has not polluted the water. But did Ani really live such a perfect life? Not quite, but that's where the heart scarab amulet comes in. It's inscribed with the words, ""Do not stand as a witness against me,"" precisely so Ani's heart doesn't betray him by recalling the time he listened to his neighbors fight or washed his feet in the Nile. Now, it's Ani's moment of truth, the weighing of the heart. If his heart is heavier than the feather, weighed down by Ani's wrongdoings, it'll be devoured  by the monstrous Ammit, part crocodile, part leopard,  part hippopotamus, and Ani will cease to exist forever. But Ani is in luck. His heart is judged pure. Ra, the sun god, takes him to Osiris, god of the underworld, who gives him final approval to enter the afterlife. In the endless and lush field of reeds, Ani meets his deceased parents. Here, there is no sadness, pain, or anger, but there is work to be done. Like everyone else, Ani must cultivate a plot of land, which he does with the help of a Shabti doll that had been placed in his tomb. Today, the Papyrus of Ani resides in the British Museum, where it has been since 1888. Only Ani, if anyone, knows what really happened after his death. But thanks to his Book of the Dead, we can imagine him happily tending his crops for all eternity. "

But they've fired their last bullet. There's no option but surrender. They've fought as long as possible. And that, after all, was always the plan. Hold out long enough for France and Britain to intervene. And indeed, as they surrender, eleven French divisions cross Germany's western border. They move almost unopposed, outnumbering German forces in the sector two to one. They take twelve settlements in a week. But then they stop. They'll go no further. And Poland fights alone. September 8th Warsaw This series is brought to you by World of Tanks PC. Check out the game at the link below and use the invite code ORLIK for extra goodies. September 8th, Warsaw Panzers drive into the city, smashing barricades and mounting the city's ruins. The Siege of Warsaw has begun. Rubble chokes the thoroughfares. Defenders have overturned street cars and dug anti-tank ditches. The Luftwaffe has nearly flattened the city, but in doing so, they've also created a landscape where it's easy to hide anti-tank guns and ambushing parties... ...and German troops have no experience in urban combat. Hidden artillery drives the first tank assaults back. Throughout the next several days, Polish tanks clash with German armored units as they probe the city, battling in barricaded squares and ancient graveyards. And as the city fights, an American photographer chronicles the horrors of the siege. Julien Bryan had arrived just before the Germans, the only foreign reporter in the city. He captures footage of a maternity hospital where new mothers shelter from bombs. Women machine-gunned in fields as they try to harvest potatoes. The city alight from firebombs. Its firefighters without water because bombers have cracked its plumbing. He'll smuggle out the film two weeks later. His resulting short documentary, Siege, will gain an Oscar nomination and help sway public opinion against the Nazis. Things are equally grim outside the city. South of Warsaw, the battered 1st Light Tank Battalion fights a rearguard action to cover the retreat toward Warsaw. They give better than they get - four Panzers destroyed for two 7TPs but they're outnumbered and increasingly outmaneuvered. The mechanized German army can advance faster than the Poles can fall back, and it's turning into a rout. German bombing has snarled communications, and Marshal Rydz-Śmigły's decision to move his headquarters to Brest has created an inability to contact command. When units receive orders, it's like the generals don't even know where they are sometimes, they receive two contradictory orders, one from Brest and one from Warsaw. Worse, the 1st Battalion has lost touch with their logistics company. It's become impossible to repair one tank without cannibalizing another, and the constant moving and fighting means 7TPs break down at an alarming rate. Desperate crews siphon diesel from trucks and civilian vehicles to keep rolling. When that runs out, they use kerosene. It will ruin the engines long-term, but there's nothing long-term about this fight, every decision is about surviving until tomorrow. The next day, the 1st Light Tank Battalion drives at the German front, Polish infantry riding on their backs. The army is withdrawing across the Vistula River, and needs breathing space to get across. 7TPs hit the German line, pushing it back long enough for more troops to escape toward Warsaw. When it comes time for the 1st Battalion to cross, they take stock - 18 tanks lost in the last few days. Several others have so little fuel, the crews drive them into the river before crossing. A week before, the battalion had 49 7TPs, only 20 crossed the bridge to fight on. September 9th Brest Marshal Rydz-Śmigły monitors reports at his new headquarters. Things are still progressing according to plan, the Polish Army is making a fighting withdraw to the Vistula River, trying to stall the Germans long enough for the French to intervene. The Germans are progressing faster than he'd hoped. But all is not lost. Back in 1920, Poland had stopped the Red Army outside Warsaw and pushed it back to Russia. They could do the same for the Germans, if the French invasion takes pressure off. For days, his generals have championed a plan to counterattack south - take pressure off Warsaw, allow more troops to withdraw there before the door slammed shut. Mass enough troops to outnumber the Germans. It's a gamble, but he agrees. A quarter of the Polish Army will cross the Bzura River and take the fight to the Germans. The initial thrust takes the Germans off-guard. A day of bloody combat sends two German divisions into retreat. But this success is short-lived. Panzers withdraw from Warsaw to deal with this new Bzura Pocket. German reserve troops flank the Poles. Within days, they've been pushed back to the river. By September 16th, they've been encircled. A quarter of the Polish Army, trapped in the Bzura Pocket. Then, the final hammer blow falls - Soviet troops cross the eastern border. September 17th Eastern Poland When Polish troops first encounter the Red Army, they believe the Soviets have come to help. Then a rifle goes off. A Polish soldier falls. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact the week before was no mere non-aggression pact, it's suddenly clear. Indeed, it included a secret protocol where Germany and the Soviet Union would carve up Eastern Europe if the borders changed - giving each a buffer state. With the invasion, the borders had changed, and the Soviets were here to take their due. Most Polish divisions have withdrawn west to fight the Germans around Warsaw. The few Polish troops in the east can do little to stop the Soviet onslaught. Poland is surrounded. The Romanian Border that Night Marshal Rydz-Śmigły is now on his third headquarters location, and he's preparing to evacuate yet again - this time, across the border. The strategic situation is untenable. Poland cannot fight the Germans in the west and the Soviets in the east. And he's just received word that the French aren't coming. They've gotten gun-shy. Britain had tried to send supplies through Romania, but Hitler used diplomatic pressure to impound them. British promises to bomb Germany never materialized - they're afraid of retaliation. So Rydz-Śmigły broadcasts a new order: Escape. All Polish forces are to attempt a breakout and cross the Romanian or Hungarian border. Poland would fall, but it would not surrender. They would reform the Polish Army in France and continue fighting. Survival was their new objective. September 18th The Bzura Pocket Polish troops, cut off for eight days, reach the breaking point. The defensive line disintegrates. German infantry and armor rush through the gaps. The Bzura counteroffensive has drawn German forces away from Warsaw, but at a terrible cost - nearly the entire Polish force is wiped out. A full quarter of the Polish Army are now dead, wounded or prisoners of war. A few units - unaware of the evacuation order, or seeing no other path open - manage to break out toward Warsaw. They trickle in, joining the defenders. Meanwhile, far to the southwest, the 1st Light Tank Company leads a desperate attack. They hope to smash through German lines and allow their comrades to reach the Romanian border. But the assault stalls. Within three days they're surrounded, running out of ammunition, almost combat ineffective. They surrender. Anyone who can makes a last-minute dash for Romania. One depleted group of TKS Tankettes rushes south, only to find their way blocked by Soviet armor. Without orders, they wheel and cross the Hungarian border instead. During another encounter, a few remaining 7TPs driving for Hungary exchange fire with Soviet tanks. When it's clear they can't break through, the crews dismount and destroy their vehicles, slipping across on foot. Other units fight rearguard actions, giving their comrades time to escape. Among them is a TKS commander named Roman Orlik. He's just taken a position hidden in the trees on the crest of a hill, when he sees panzers coming through the fields below. He's alone up here, the only tank in his company with a 20mm cannon. But he has surprise on his side. Firing from concealment, he holes three Panzers, blunting the charge. Before the fighting is over, he'll destroy ten more vehicles, becoming the only TKS ace of the war. But he will not reach the border. Instead, he and his company will defend Warsaw. September 28th Ten days later, Warsaw is falling. After a punishing artillery bombardment, German troops overwhelm the fortresses on the city's southern flank. Food, water, and ammunition have nearly run out. For nearly three weeks the Poles have repelled assault after assault, but the Germans have finally cracked the armor. At 2:00 PM, the Polish commander orders the garrison to stand down. Forty thousand have died in the city's defense. Fighting continues. Some cities hold out a few more days. Troops situated on good defensive ground last another week. Combat finally ends on October 6th. The Germans and Soviets go about dividing the country, as per their agreement. Sixty-six thousand Polish soldiers are dead, and over 130,000 wounded. Three-quarters of a million are prisoners. Many of these will not live to see the end of the war, dying from mistreatment or Soviet execution programs. Civilian deaths are equal or higher. Poland had held out for five weeks while being invaded by two of the largest militaries on Earth. It proved costlier than expected. Sixteen thousand Germans have been killed, and twice as many wounded. The Poles had destroyed 674 tanks and 319 armoured vehicles, with more damaged and needing repair. Meanwhile, Polish troops are making their way west. They escape from internment camps in Romania and Hungary, dressing in civilian clothing, dodging police and slipping across borders. Tense of thousands make it to France and form an army. Polish troops will fight for the rest of the war in France, the Middle East, Arnhem, and Monte Cassino. They'll enter Berlin with the Red Army. A Polish squadron, the 303rd, will claim more kills than any other in the Battle of Britain. And the same Polish tankers whose 7TPs dueled Panzers in 1939 would come ashore at Normandy in Sherman tanks. Meanwhile, in occupied Warsaw, resistance forces begin building an underground army. Poland has fallen - but it is not defeated. Thanks World of Tanks PC for sponsoring this series.

230,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,257wV-AbKaE,"As one of the most notorious gangsters in history, Al Capone presided over a vast and profitable empire of organized crime. When he was finally put on trial, the most he could be convicted of was tax evasion. The nearly $100 million a year, that's 1.4 billion in today's currency, that Capone had earned from illegal gambling, bootlegging, brothels, and extortion, would have served as evidence of his crimes. But the money was nowhere to be found. Capone and his associates had hidden it through investments in various businesses whose ultimate ownership couldn't be proven, like cash-only laundromats. In fact, those laundromats are part of the reason for the name of this activity, money laundering. Money laundering came  to be the term for any process that cleans illegally obtained funds of their dirty criminal origins, allowing them to be used within the legal economy. But Capone wasn't the first to launder money. In fact, this practice is about as old as money itself. Merchants hid their riches from tax collecters, and pirates sought to sell their bounty without drawing attention to how they got it. With the recent arrival  of virtual currencies, offshore banking, the darknet, and global markets, schemes have become much more complex. Although modern money laundering methods vary greatly, most share three basic steps: placement, layering, and integration. Placement is where illegally obtained money is converted into assets that seem legitimate. That's often done by depositing funds into a bank account registered to an anonymous corporation or a professional middleman. This step is where criminals are often most vulnerable to detection since they introduce massive wealth into the financial system seemingly out of nowhere. The second step, layering, involves using multiple transactions to further distance the funds from their origin. This can take the form of transfers between multiple accounts, or the purchase of tradable property, like expensive cars, artwork, and real estate. Casinos, where large sums of money change hands every second, are also popular venues for layering. A money launderer may have their gambling balance made available at a casino chain's locations in other countries, or work with employees to rig games. The last step, integration, allows clean money to re-enter the mainstream economy and to benefit the original criminal. They might invest it into a legal business claiming payment by producing fake invoices, or even start a bogus charity, placing themselves on the board of directors with an exorbitant salary. Money laundering itself wasn't officially recognized as a federal crime in the United States until 1986. Before that point, the government needed to prosecute a related crime, like tax evasion. From 1986 on, they could confiscate wealth simply by demonstrating that concealment had occurred, which had a positive effect on prosecuting major criminal operations, like drug traffickers. However, a legal shift has raised concerns involving privacy  and government surveillance. Today, the United Nations, national governments, and various nonprofits fight against money laundering, yet the practice continues to play a major role in global crime. And the most high-profile instances of money laundering have involved not just private individuals, but major financial institutions and government officials. No one knows for sure the total amount of money that's laundered on a yearly basis, but some organizations estimate it to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars. "

A British officer, the naval attaché to neutral Sweden, is having dinner alone when the waiter interrupts him with a telephone call from the embassy. His eyes widen. He slams down the receiver and rushes out. Waiting for him at the embassy is a Norwegian colonel, the man Swedish intelligence leaks to when they want information to land in British hands. He has a sighting report from a Swedish cruiser. They relay it to London via encrypted telegram, and it says: ""At 1500, two large warships, escorted by three destroyers, five ships and ten or twelve planes, passed to the northeast.""

The hunt for the Bismarck is one of the most dramatic events of World War II. It's a story of great ships clashing in frozen waters, a tale of risk-taking, heroism and shocking loss, and the blind luck that sometimes changes history. So when Wargaming contacted us again saying that they wanted to sponsor a series of episodes on the Bismarck, we jumped on that right away. But what makes the Bismarck story interesting isn't just the ships and the battles, it's the hunt. For the Royal Navy, the biggest problem wasn't sinking the Bismarck, it was finding it. This is a detective story writ large, an international manhunt that stretched from the icy seas of the Denmark Strait to the chattering computers of Bletchley Park. It will begin with an interrupted dinner, and end with the destruction of the largest battleship on Earth. Allow me to set the scene. 21st of May. Early Morning. A British Naval Base at Scapa Flow. Vice Admiral John Tovey, commander of the Home Fleet, is aboard his flagship thinking that this might finally be it. For days, German reconnaissance planes have passed above him, recording the position of his ships. Scapa Flow is a hard station, a barren rock in freezing seas, but it's also strategically crucial real estate. From their base in Scapa, Tovey's fleet guards the watery expanse that stretches between Greenland and Nazi-occupied Norway, and securing that line was the only thing keeping Britain alive. This is a crucial juncture in the War. The previous year, France had collapsed, German forces had occupied Norway and Denmark, and the Italians had entered the war on the side of its fascist ally, Germany. The Axis Powers were now masters of Europe, and Britain stood alone, besieged in its own islands. As Luftwaffe raids pounded its cities, American supply convoys were the only thing keeping Britain in the fight. This was a tonnage war, measured in cargo delivered rather than ships sunk, convoys raced through U-boat infested waters to get Fortress Britain enough food, bullets and oil to defend democracy. Tovey's nightmare was of a single ship: The Bismarck. British intelligence had been building a file on her for some time, even attending her launch in 1939 and monitoring her sea travels via air and signals intercepts. They still didn't know everything, they didn't know how fast she was, her crew complement, or what new technologies she had, but they did know that she was enormous and advanced, outfitted with both heavy armor and 15-inch guns that could sink near anything the Royal Navy could throw at it. But the British also knew that Bismarck was more than a ship: she was a political statement. Hitler had jump-started Germany's economy with public spending, including a focus on military rearmament. The Bismarck was a visible symbol of Germany's economic miracle, a nation with a 100% employment rate, provided you didn't count the Jews and the women forced out of the workplace. And at over forty thousand tons, Bismarck was also a flagrant violation of post World War I treaties that limited the size of Germany's naval vessels. This ship celebrated the Nazis' success, and proclaimed their warlike intentions. This was a new Germany: an economically strong Germany that had military ambition and rejected any attempt to restrain it. But so far, this great ship was still bottled up in the Baltic, operating out of ports in northern Germany and occupied Poland. But if the Bismarck could stage a break out, slip between Denmark and Norway and cut north into the Atlantic, it could plunge down into the Atlantic convoys, a knife straight into Britain's supply artery. Previous German raids had proved costly, and those ships had only been a quarter the size of Bismarck. Tovey's phone rings, a direct line from the Admiralty in London. The call passes on the Swedish Navy's sighting, but now, it's corroborated with more information. A Polish source reported that the Bismarck left port three days ago, and a Norwegian resistance cell spotted a group of German ships passing between Norway and Denmark. Royal Air Force reconnaissance planes, they say, are currently scouring the fjords. Tovey issues an order to his fleet: refuel and standby to sail. 13:15 hours. In Norway. An RAF pilot cruising the fjords spots and photographs a large ship with a heavy cruiser nearby. Back in Scotland, an analyst confirms the silhouette while the photos are still damp from the darkroom: it's the Bismarck, probably with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen. The photos confirm Tovey's greatest fear. Worse: the weather is deteriorating, with fog forecast overnight. Bismarck had probably been hiding in the fjords, waiting for just such weather to cover its dash to the Atlantic. Tovey summons his subordinate, Vice Admiral Lancelot Holland, and details his plan. Holland will take his squadron to southern Iceland and hold there, staying in a position to intercept the Bismarck regardless of whether she sails down the east or the west coast of the island. Tovey will stay in Scapa, in case the Bismarck tries to use the foul weather to sneak past the north side of Britain. The cruisers currently patrolling the Denmark Strait would stay on course with orders to spot and shadow the Bismarck, then radio its course so Holland can intercept. Holland's squadron slips out at midnight. 22nd of May at 02:00 hours, in Norway. An RAF bombing raid hits the Bismarck's last known position, releasing their payloads blind due to the low clouds. Heavy fog, no sighting. Further reconnaissance flights are futile for the next several hours. 20:00 hours. In the Scapa Flow. Admiral Tovey, who has been living next to the phone for the last 24 hours, receives a report from the Admiralty: a daring reconnaissance plane has flown low enough to break through the clouds. The Bismarck is gone. Any further reconnaissance fights are grounded due to poor weather. He orders the command to sail for Iceland immediately, hoping to fill any gaps in their screen. In the 30 hours since the last sighting of the Bismarck, the German raiders could've sailed 600 miles toward the Atlantic access points around Iceland. As Tovey leaves port, he radios Holland to say that Bismarck is heading his way, and that the fleet must maintain radio silence. The Bismarck has slipped through the first net, it must not slip through another. 23rd of May, 19:22 hours. The Denmark Strait. Two sister cruisers have been searching the icy, mine-filled waters of the Denmark Strait for 50 hours, ever since the Bismarck was last spotted, when a lookout sees two ships emerge from a snowstorm. He thinks they're British at first, but a second glance sends him scrambling. It's a German battleship, and only seven miles away, well within the killing range of its 15-inch guns. Action stations sound. The officers below abandon their pre-dinner sherry. Running feet pound the deck. The cruiser turns hard over and makes for the fog, its 8-inch guns useless against the steel behemoth. For three agonizing minutes, the crew waits for incoming shells as their little ship slowly takes cover in the mist. The Bismarck's shells never arrive. Reorienting herself, the cruiser stalks its quarry through the fog and rain, deploying its most effective weapon: a sensor array. These cruisers may not have heavy guns, but they're outfitted with advanced systems that allow them to track enemy ships solely by radar, a feat never achieved before. The cruiser radios its sighting report to her sister ship fifteen miles south, who relays it to the rest of the fleet and rushes to join the pursuit. An hour passes 20:30 hours. The Denmark Strait. Overeager and heading at speed, the second cruiser plunges through a fog bank to find itself nearly head-on with the Bismarck, six miles away and closing at 30 knots. Her captain orders the helm hard to starboard and deploys a smoke screen, breaking for the mist. This time, the Bismarck is quick on the draw. A salvo of 15-inch shells lands behind the vessel's stern, rattling it with metal splinters. Another shell lands 50 yards short and skips like a stone over the bridge. But the cruiser escapes, shrouded in mist. The twin cruisers, a little wiser and a bit more careful, fall in behind the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen, staying out of sight but within the ten-mile range of their radar arrays, quietly broadcasting Bismarck's position to the fleet. 21:00 hours. The Interception Fleet at Denmark Strait. Admiral Holland's battlecruiser force plunges towards the Bismarck. There are rough seas and snow flurries in the strait, with waves so high that their destroyer escorts are getting submerged and have to pull back. Destroyers will do little good anyway, Holland knows. This will be a two-on-two battle of capital ships. At his disposal he has the newest ship in the British fleet: The Prince of Wales and his flagship, the pride of the Royal Navy, the HMS Hood. The Hood has been called the most beautiful ship afloat. Between the wars, she had circumnavigated the globe as a symbol of British invincibility. She's the star of fleet reviews and propaganda reels. Many of her crew got their first taste of navy life by seeing her at holiday parades or through childhood tours of her deck. She is the beloved, the unsinkable, The Mighty Hood. And she is steaming toward destruction. Join us next time for a clash of flagships, a wounded giant, and a three-word order that will echo throughout naval history. "
232,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,2DWnvx1NYUA,"Imagine a future where nobody dies— instead, our minds are uploaded to a digital world. They might live on in a realistic, simulated environment with avatar bodies, and could still call in and contribute  to the biological world. Mind uploading has powerful appeal— but what would it actually take to scan a person’s brain and upload their mind? The main challenges are scanning a brain in enough detail to capture the mind and perfectly recreating that detail artificially. But first, we have to know what to scan. The human brain contains  about 86 billion neurons, connected by at least a hundred trillion synapses. The pattern of connectivity among the brain’s neurons, that is, all of the neurons and all their connections to each other, is called the connectome. We haven’t yet mapped  the connectome, and there’s also a lot more to neural signaling. There are hundreds, possibly thousands of different kinds of connections, or synapses. Each functions in a slightly different way. Some work faster, some slower. Some grow or shrink rapidly in the process of learning; some are more stable over time. And beyond the trillions of precise,  1-to-1 connections between neurons, some neurons also spray out  neurotransmitters that affect many other neurons at once. All of these different kinds of interactions would need to be mapped in order to  copy a person’s mind. There are also a lot of influences on  neural signaling that are poorly understood  or undiscovered. To name just one example, patterns of activity between neurons are likely influenced by a type of cell called glia. Glia surround neurons and,  according to some scientists, may even outnumber them  by as many as ten to one. Glia were once thought to be purely  for structural support, and their functions are still  poorly understood, but at least some of them can generate  their own signals that influence information processing. Our understanding of the brain isn’t good  enough to determine what we’d need to scan in order  to replicate the mind, but assuming our knowledge does  advance to that point, how would we scan it? Currently, we can accurately scan a living human brain with resolutions of about half a  millimeter using our best non-invasive scanning method, MRI. To detect a synapse, we’ll need to scan at a resolution of about a micron— a thousandth of a millimeter. To distinguish the kind of synapse and  precisely how strong each synapse is, we’ll need even better resolution. MRI depends on powerful magnetic fields. Scanning at the resolution required to determine the details of individual synapses would requires a field strength high enough to cook a person’s tissues. So this kind of leap in resolution would require fundamentally  new scanning technology. It would be more feasible to scan a dead brain using an electron microscope, but even that technology is nowhere  near good enough– and requires killing the subject first. Assuming we eventually understand the brain well enough to know what to scan and develop the technology to safely scan at that resolution, the next challenge would be to recreate that information digitally. The main obstacles to doing so are computing power and storage space, both of which are improving every year. We’re actually much closer to attaining  this technological capacity than we are to understanding or scanning  our own minds. Artificial neural networks already run  our internet search engines, digital assistants, self-driving cars,  Wall Street trading algorithms, and smart phones. Nobody has yet built an artificial network with 86 billion neurons, but as computing technology improves, it may be possible to keep track  of such massive data sets. At every step in the scanning and  uploading process, we’d have to be certain we were capturing all the necessary information accurately— or there’s no telling what ruined version of a mind might emerge. While mind uploading is  theoretically possible, we’re likely hundreds of years away from the technology and scientific understanding that would make it a reality. And that reality would come with ethical  and philosophical considerations: who would have access to mind uploading? What rights would be accorded to uploaded minds? How could this technology be abused? Even if we can eventually upload  our minds, whether we should remains an open question. "
233,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,2S6e11NBwiw,"Where does all this stuff come from? This rock? That cow? Your heart? Not the things themselves, mind you, but what they're made of: the atoms that are  the fabric of all things. To answer that question, we look to the law of conservation of mass. This law says take an isolated system defined by a boundary that matter and energy cannot cross. Inside this system, mass,  a.k.a. matter and energy, can neither be created nor destroyed. The universe, to the best of our knowledge, is an isolated system. But before we get to that, let's look at a much smaller and simpler one. Here we have six carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 18 oxygen atoms. With a little energy, our molecules can really get moving. These atoms can bond together to form familiar molecules. Here's water, and here's carbon dioxide. We can't create or destroy mass. We're stuck with what we've got, so what can we do? Ah, they have a mind of their own. Let's see. They've formed more  carbon dioxide and water, six of each. Add a little energy, and we can get them to reshuffle themselves to a simple sugar, and some oxygen gas. Our atoms are all accounted for: 6 carbon, 12 hydrogen, and 18 oxygen. The energy we applied is now stored in the bonds between atoms. We can rerelease that energy by breaking that sugar back into water and carbon dioxide, and still, same atoms. Let's put a few of our atoms aside and try something a little more explosive. This here is methane, most commonly  associated with cow flatulence, but also used for rocket fuel. If we add some oxygen and a little bit of energy, like you might get from a lit match, it combusts into carbon dioxide, water and even more energy. Notice our methane started  with four hydrogen, and at the end we still have four hydrogen captured in two water molecules. For a grand finale, here's propane, another combustible gas. We add oxygen, light it up, and boom. More water and carbon dioxide. This time we get three CO2s because the propane molecule started with three carbon atoms, and they have nowhere else to go. There are many other reactions we can model with this small set of atoms, and the law of conservation of mass always holds true. Whatever matter and energy  go into a chemical reaction are present and accounted  for when it's complete. So if mass can't be created or destroyed, where did these atoms come from in the first place? Let's turn back the clock and see. Further, further, further, too far. Okay, there it is. The Big Bang. Our hydrogen formed from  a high-energy soup of particles in the three minutes that followed the birth of our universe. Eventually, clusters of atoms accumulated and formed stars. Within these stars, nuclear reactions  fused light elements, such as hydrogen and helium, to form heavier elements, such as carbon and oxygen. At first glance, these reactions may look like they're breaking the law because they release an astounding amount of energy, seemingly out of nowhere. However, thanks to Einstein's famous equation, we know that energy is equivalent to mass. It turns out that the total mass  of the starting atoms is very slightly more than the mass of the products, and that loss of mass perfectly corresponds to the gain in energy, which radiates out from the star as light, heat and energetic particles. Eventually, this star went supernova and scattered its elements across space. Long story short, they found each other and atoms from other supernovas, formed the Earth, and 4.6 billion years later got scooped up to play their parts in our little isolated system. But they're not nearly as interesting as the atoms that came together to form you, or that cow, or this rock. And that is why,  as Carl Sagan famously told us, we are all made of star stuff. "
234,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,2aoIs-5zqoI,"Far beneath the palace of the treacherous King Minos, in the damp darkness of an inescapable labryinth, a horrific beast stalks the endless corridors of its prison, enraged with a bloodlust so intense that its deafening roar shakes the Earth. It is easy to see why the Minotaur myth has a long history of being disregarded as pure fiction. However, there's a good chance that the Minotaur and other monsters and gods were created by our early ancestors to rationalize the terrifying things that they saw in the natural world but did not understand. And while we can't explain  every aspect of their stories, there may be some actual science that reveals itself when we dissect them for clues. So, as far as we know, there have never been human-bull hybrids. But the earliest material written about the Minotaur doesn't even mention its physical form. So that's probably not the key  part of the story. What the different tellings do agree upon, however, is that the beast lives underground, and when it bellows,  it causes tremendous problems. The various myths are also specific in stating that genius inventor Daedalus, carved out the labyrinth  beneath the island of Crete. Archeological attempts to find the fabled maze have come up empty handed. But Crete itself has yielded the most valuable clue of all in the form of seismic activity. Crete sits on a piece of continental crust called the Aegean Block, and has a bit of oceanic crust known as the Nubian Block sliding right beneath it. This sort of geologic feature, called a subduction zone, is common all over the world and results in lots of earthquakes. However, in Crete the situation is particularly volatile as the Nubian Block is attached to the massive buoyant continental crust that is Africa. When the Nubian Block moves, it does not go down nearly  as easily or as steeply as oceanic crust does in most other subduction zones. Instead, it violently and abruptly forces sections of the Mediterranean upwards in an event called uplift, and Crete is in uplift central. In the year 2014, Crete had more than 1300 earthquakes of magnitude 2.0 or higher. By comparison, in the same period of time, Southern California, a much larger area, experienced a mere 255 earthquakes. Of course, we don't have detailed seismic records from the days of King Minos, but we do know from fossil records and geologic evidence that Crete has experienced  serious uplift events that sometimes exceeded 30 feet in a single moment. Contrast this for a moment with the island of Hawaii, where earthquakes and volcanic activity were tightly woven to legends surrounding Pele, a goddess both fiery and fair. Like the Minotaur, her myths included tales of destruction, but they also contained elements of dance and creation. So why did Hawaii end up with Pele and Crete end up with the Minotaur? The difference likely comes down to the lava that followed many of Hawaii's worst earthquakes. The lava on Hawaii is made of basalt, which once cooled, is highly fertile. Within a couple of decades of terrible eruptions, Islanders would have seen  vibrant green life thriving on new peninsulas made of lava. So it makes sense that the mythology captured this by portraying Pele as creator as well as a destroyer. As for the people of Crete, their earthquakes brought only destruction and barren lands, so perhaps for them the unnatural and deadly Minotaur was born. The connections between mythical stories and the geology of the regions where they originated teach us that mythology and science are actually two sides of the same coin. Both are rooted in explaining and understanding the world. The key difference is that where mythology uses gods, monsters and magic, science uses measurements, records and experiments. "
235,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,39Gsx6PaxiY," When we left off, Yi had crushed the Japanese at the battle of Myeongnyang and was busy rebuilding the Korean navy after their disastrous losses while he was being falsely accused. Now, just as he's beginning to coordinate with the Chinese navy on how to prosecute the war, something major happens. Maybe the one event that can truly change the course of this war. Hideyoshi dies. Six years and four months after the fateful Japanese landing on Korea, the man who started it all, the man who envisioned a vast Asian Empire radiating out from Japan, died. This was a sea change. Hideyoshi had been holding the Japanese in Korea by sheer force of will. As soon as he died, the council of men who ran Japan in his stead all looked at one another and said 'does anyone here actually want to keep fighting Korea? Okay show of hands who wants to stay in Korea? Nobody? All right then.' With that they agreed to pull the Japanese forces out of there as soon as they could negotiate a deal which would let them withdraw their forces safely. But the Koreans were not so eager for peace after seeing hundreds of thousands of their countrymen slaughtered during Hideyoshi's invasion. So admiral Yi continued to coordinate with the Chinese forces to bottle up the Japanese in one of their last strongholds, the port of Suncheon. The Chinese army closed around the city on land and the Korean and Chinese navies blockaded the port. Seeing the situation as hopeless, the Japanese commander decided the best option he had left was to try to bribe everybody, but each time it seemed as though he was succeeding in bribing the Chinese contingents, Yi shamed them into falling back in line. Seeing no hope of peaceful retreat, the Japanese commander had one last plan. He dispatched a messenger boat to slip through the Chinese lines and tell the other major Japanese garrison to deploy all their ships and rendezvous with him as they tried to break their way through the Chinese and Korean blockade. But Yi got word of this plan, and knew that he must prepare. The next night, November 15 1598, long after the Sun had fallen below the horizon, and the water had faded from blue to deep black, Yi told his forces to slip away from the blockade. They would try to intercept the reinforcing fleet in the fateful Noryang strait. Near 2:00 a.m., the joint Korean and Chinese fleet fell upon the resting Japanese ships. At first it was chaos, cannon lighting up the water at night. But soon the Japanese tried to regroup. Despite being caught off guard they still had 500 ships to the combined 150 of Yi and the Chinese. And moreover, they were fueled by desperation. If they lost here, who knows if they'd ever see Japan again? But the Allied Forces had two advantages going for them as well. For one, they had once again caught the Japanese in a strait where they could not easily maneuver their massive fleet, and two, even if they could maneuver, many of their ships were transports, which were only useful for boarding and arquebus fire in a fight. In desperation, the Japanese attacked, driving their ships through the withering hail of the enemy cannonade. Unfortunately for Yi, the Chinese commander who wasn't used to fighting the Japanese and had no experience with Yi's long range form of naval warfare, charged forward to meet the Japanese fleet and prepared to engage them in hand-to-hand combat. The Chinese commander was surrounded. Dozens of Japanese ships descended on the Chinese flagship. Yi ordered his own ship to attempt a rescue. Yi's flagship plunged into the midst of the enemy. He was committed now. It would be fierce close combat the rest of the way, exactly the type of fight Yi had always tried to avoid. The vessels were so close that unarmed Korean sailors began throwing bundles of burning sticks down on the enemy decks. As Yi's ship broke through the waves, he spotted three of the enemy's admiral standing on the deck of one of the Japanese ships, attacking his ally. And so, Yi drew his bow and loosed. One of the admirals fell. For a moment there was almost a silence in the midst of the fighting as everybody looked to see where that arrow had come from. Then one of the Japanese admirals roused himself from his shock and shouted that it was Yi. All the ships must attack Yi! All the Japanese vessels turned and began to give chase to Yi's flagship. But now it was the Chinese admiral's turn to take action, and his ships tore into the vessels pursuing Yi. Soon the fight was on the deck of the Chinese flagship. Chinese dao sparking against Japanese katana. In the end the Japanese boarding parties were repelled, but many from both sides lay dead on the deck. As dawn began to bring light back to the scene, everyone could see how badly the Japanese were faring. They attempted to flee, but Yi would have none of it. These people who had come to his land, who had despoiled his home, who had slaughtered his people and endangered his nation. No. He would not let them flee. He grabbed the mallet from the ship's drummer and began to beat the war drum himself, urging his ship to go ever faster. The haunting echo of the drum pushed the fleet on. Its beat hounded the Japanese, bit at their heels. His fleet moved like it never had before. The drums steadily beating like the call of the god of war. They were upon the Japanese. Cannons roared, arquebuses answered. Shouts and screams were heard as ship after ship was caught by the pursuing fleet. Possessed by the beat of the drums of war. But then just for an instant, the drums faltered. Seen by no one but his son, his nephew, and a loyal servant, Yi had been struck by a stray arquebus ball. They rushed to his side as he slumped against the drum, trying to aid him, asking if there was anything they could do. With his last breath he said to them,  'We are about to win this war. Keep beating the drum. Do not let anyone know of my death.' His son picked up the mallet and continued the beat. Dressed in Yi's armor, his son and his nephew took up the command. For hours, they were Yi, commanding as he would with all his ability and skill. None of Yi's officers ever realized he had fallen until as the battle was closing the Chinese flagship was once again surrounded. Yi's son ordered his ship into the thick. They darted forward, breaking the cordon around the Chinese flagship, helping the Chinese to escape. The fighting was fierce, but it was near the last of it. And as the day closed, the Chinese admiral sailed toward Yi's flagship, and called out to thank Yi for saving him. To invite Yi to celebrate the glorious day together. But he was met by Yi's son. Instantly he knew what had happened and three times he threw himself to the deck wailing and crying out, 'Even after death you saved my life.' This was the last battle of the war. 300 Japanese ships were destroyed or captured. After this the remaining Japanese garrisons would either be captured one by one by the Chinese and Korean forces or slip back to Japan to fight one last struggle before Tokugawa's ascension as shogun. At last the Imjin War was at an end. Hideyoshi's dream of a Japanese Empire was broken. Korea was free, but Yi would never see it. Thousands turned out to see his body returned to his small Home village. People lined the road and wailed at the passing of a man they may never have met. The Chinese admiral wrote for him a eulogy and even the court and the king tried to make their recompense. And so passed the man so ill treated in life, so often demoted and accused, the man who would forever be known as the Martial Lord of Loyalty. "
236,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,3TwgVQIZPsw,"Why do we buy certain products or choose certain brands? This is the sort of question advertisers have always asked, and there are no easy answers. However, there is a handy tool that helps companies explore this and similar questions, and it's called the focus group. Until the 1940s, market research was often quantitative using things like sales figures and customer polls to track consumption. But this changed during World War II. Sociologists Robert Merton and Paul Lazarsfeld set out to learn how unprecedented exposure to wartime propaganda was affecting the public. Instead of polling large numbers of people with straightforward questions and quantifiable answers, the researchers conducted  in-person interviews, sometimes with small groups, engaging them in more open discussions. Later, this method was picked up by the advertising industry with the help of consultants, like Austrian-born psychologist Ernest Dichter, who first coined the term focus group. This new technique was a type of qualitative research focused on the nature of people's preferences and thoughts. It couldn't tell marketers what percentage of people buy a certain product or brand, but it could tell them more about the people who do, their reasoning for doing so, and even the unconscious motivations behind those reasons. Rather than providing definite conclusions for business and sales, focus groups would be used for exploratory research, generating new ideas for products and marketing based on deeper understanding of consumer habits. For example, early focus groups found that contrary to popular opinion at the time, wives often had more influence than their husbands when choosing which car to buy, so Chrysler shifted gears by marketing cars directly to women. And Dr. Dichter himself conducted focus groups for Mattel to learn what girls wanted in a doll. The result was the original Barbie doll. So how does a focus group work? First, companies recruit between six and ten participants according to specific criteria that meet their research objectives. They could be mothers of children between five and seven, or teenagers planning to buy a new phone in the next three months. This is often done through professional recruiters who manage lists of people who've agreed to participate in focus groups for payment or other rewards. During a session, participants are asked to respond to various prompts from the group moderator, like sharing their opinions on a certain product, or their emotional reactions to an advertisement. They may even be asked to do seemingly unrelated tasks, like imagining brands as animals in a zoo. The idea is that this can reveal  useful information about the participant's feelings that traditional questions  might not get to. Beyond these basics, many variations are possible. A focus group may have two or more moderators perhaps taking opposite sides on a question, or a researcher might be hidden in the focus group unknown to other participants to see how their answers can be influenced. And the whole process may also be observed by researchers through a one-way mirror. But although they can provide valuable insight, focus groups do have their limitations, and one of the main ones is that the simple act of observing something can change it. This principle is called observer interference. The answers participants give are likely to be affected by the presence of the researchers, social pressure  from the rest of the group, or simply knowing that they're taking part in a focus group. And because researchers often use a small sample size in a specific setting, it's hard to generalize their results. The findings that researchers do reach from focus groups are often tested through experiments and data gathering. Those put numbers on questions like how many potential customers there are and what price they'd be willing to pay. This part of the process changes as technology evolves. But focus groups have remained largely the same for decades. Perhaps when it comes to the big, important questions, there's no substitute for people genuinely interacting with each other. "
237,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,3_mo0Vh1b08,"Tonight we must begin with the first story the myth written before all myths the myth that we have the oldest record of the story of Gilgamesh so when I say Gilga, you say Mesh Gilga ? Gi.. oh no ok  we'll work on that at the dawning of civilizations there was a great king in the ancient city of Uruk in the land of Sumer which will be later be known as Babylon he was so mighty none could stand before him for he was 2/3 god and 1/3 man I don't quite know how the maths plays out there but that's besides the point his name was Gilgamesh and wherever he went he slew his enemies and cast them down before him but his might made him a tyrant. Bored he would force young men of Uruk into contests of endurance until they dropped from exhaustion, and of the women, he claimed their marriage bed. No daughter of Uruk was safe from his lust. So the people of Uruk cried out to the gods, and the gods heard them, and conferred on what to do. At last, they decided to fashion a being to match Gilgamesh's strength. so the two of them might exist as equals, and exhaust Gilgamesh's boundless energy, and so they fashioned a wild man out of water and clay They placed him in the wilderness and named him Enkidu. His body was matted with hair like an animal's, and the hair on his head grew thick like barley and was long as could be. He ate grass with the beasts of the wild, and cavoided with the Gazelles at the watering hole. Like this He was happy. But then one day a trapper came to the watering hole, and and saw Enkidu dancing with the beast and was afraid, because he could see the savage strength in Enkidu. And so he came back again and again to observe him and finally realized This was the man who had been troubling him. Because for some time now, The trapper had been presented with a mystery. He would dig pits to catch the animals and they would get filled in He would lay snares for the beast and they would get taken apart, so he could not catch any game. Now, though, he knew that it was Enkidu saving the animals The trapper went to his father to ask for advice, and his father told him to get the priestess Shamhat to seduce this wild man. So the trapper traveled to Uruk, to ask Gilgamesh for priestess' aid Gilgamesh agreed, and Shamhat accompanied the trapper back to Enkidu's watering hole. When Enkidu saw Shamhat, he was smitten with her charms, and for 6 days and 7 nights, they made love. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) At last, Enkidu turned back to his herd, but they rejected him, for he had traded the ways of the wild for the ways of humankind. And so he returned to Shamhat, and she spoke kindly to him, and offered to take him back to Uruk where he could be with other people but on the way, Shamhat took him to a shepherd's camp, and there, set before him, were bread and ale. But Enkidu knew not how to eat bread or drink from a cup, and so at the camp, they taught him of the human things. And their barber combed his hair, put oils in it, and he, for the first time, wore clothes, and took up arms. And he took over the watch for the shepherds, fighting off wolves and lions who came too near. Then, one day, he was invited to a wedding, and he asked what such a thing was. And as the shepherds explained to him, they also told him of Gilgamesh, and how it was his custom to sleep with the bride before the husband. Enkidu was appalled by this, so he strode off to Uruk, to change this custom his way. meanwhile Gilgamesh walked down the streets of Uruk, but when he got to the door of the marriage house, he found that someone had the impudence to stick their foot out and block his way. Looking up, he saw Enkidu standing before him. Without a word, they lunged at each other. They wrestled in the street their titanic frames making the houses shake as they threw one another into walls, and pummel each other into buildings. After a long battle, exhausted, they each rolled aside, and lay panting in the street. But GIlgamesh recovered first, and offered a hand to Enkidu to help him up. His anger had cooled. He was impressed by Enkidu's strength, and as Enkidu stood, Gilgamesh offered him not just his hand, but his friendship. They swore friendship to one another, which reads to me that the power of friendship is actually enough to stop a brutal dictator. Thanks, mythology! Soon, Gilgamesh proposed to his friend an adventure he long had in mind The fierce giant Humbaba, whose words are fire and whose breath is death, stalks the forest of cedars, where the gods dwell. So to his newfound friend, Gilgamesh said, ""Dude, to immortalize our names and make them known, wherever people linger, we should totally slay this demon! *laughs*"" But Enkidu had known Humbaba from his days in the wild and said, ""Why would you wanna do such a thing ? he can hear for, like, like sixty leagues, and his force is like the deluge. When warriors wanna refer to an unwinnable battle they call it a 'Humbaba's ambush', man!"" but Gilgamesh was not swayed. He replied ""Like all things mortal, our days are numbered. so, let us write our epic upon the SKY! *laughs* And with that, he grabbed his new friend's hand, and dragged him into the forge, where together, they cast great axes of war, and daggers sharp and swift. At last, Gilgamesh gathered the people of Uruk and proposed to them what he was to do. And the wisest of them cried out and implored him not to go. Because remember, he's totally a good dude now, and everybody loves him now, because of friendship! Humbaba so would not Gilgamesh for he had a demon to kill bro "
238,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,3klMM9BkW5o,"How do you get what you want using just your words? Aristotle set out to answer exactly that question over 2,000 years ago with the Treatise on Rhetoric. Rhetoric, according to Aristotle, is the art of seeing the available means of persuasion. And today we apply it to any form of communication. Aristotle focused on oration, though, and he described three types of persuasive speech. Forensic, or judicial, rhetoric establishes facts and judgements about the past, similar to detectives at a crime scene. Epideictic, or demonstrative, rhetoric makes a proclamation about the present situation, as in wedding speeches. But the way to accomplish change is through deliberative rhetoric, or symbouleutikon. Rather than the past or the present, deliberative rhetoric focuses on the future. It's the rhetoric of politicians debating a new law by imagining  what effect it might have, like when Ronald Regan warned that the introduction of Medicare would lead to a socialist future  spent telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in America when men were free. But it's also the rhetoric of activists urging change, such as Martin Luther King Jr's dream that his children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. In both cases, the speaker's present their audience with a possible future and try to enlist their help in avoiding or achieving it. But what makes  for good deliberative rhetoric, besides the future tense? According to Aristotle, there are three persuasive appeals: ethos, logos, and pathos. Ethos is how you convince an audience of your credibility. Winston Churchill began his 1941 address to the U.S. Congress by declaring, ""I have been in full harmony all my life with the tides which have flowed on both sides of the Atlantic against privilege and monopoly,"" thus highlighting his virtue as someone committed to democracy. Much earlier, in his defense  of the poet Archias, Roman consul Cicero appealed to his own practical wisdom and expertise as a politician: ""Drawn from my study  of the liberal sciences and from that careful training to which I admit that at no part of my life I have ever been disinclined."" And finally, you can demonstrate disinterest, or that you're not motivated by personal gain. Logos is the use of logic and reason. This method can employ rhetorical devices such as analogies, examples, and citations of research or statistics. But it's not just facts and figures. It's also the structure and content of the speech itself. The point is to use factual knowledge to convince the audience, as in Sojourner Truth's argument for women's rights: ""I have as much muscle as any man and can do as much work as any man. I have plowed and reaped and husked and chopped and mowed and can any man do more than that?"" Unfortunately, speakers can also manipulate people with false information that the audience thinks is true, such as the debunked but still widely believed claim that vaccines cause autism. And finally, pathos appeals to emotion, and in our age of mass media, it's often the most effective mode. Pathos is neither inherently good nor bad, but it may be irrational  and unpredictable. It can just as easily rally people for peace as incite them to war. Most advertising, from beauty products that promise to relieve our physical insecurities to cars that make us feel powerful, relies on pathos. Aristotle's rhetorical appeals  still remain powerful tools today, but deciding which of them to use is a matter of knowing your audience and purpose, as well as the right place and time. And perhaps just as important is being able to notice when these same methods of persuasion are being used on you. "
239,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,3s2QPQnuaGk,"In mythological ancient Greece, soaring above Crete on wings made from wax and feathers, Icarus, the son of Daedalus, defied the laws of both man and nature. Ignoring the warnings of his father, he rose higher and higher. To witnesses on the ground, he looked like a god, and as he peered down from above, he felt like one, too. But, in mythological ancient Greece, the line that separated god from man was absolute and the punishment for mortals who attempted to cross it was severe. Such was the case for Icarus and Daedalus. Years before Icarus was born, his father Daedalus was highly regarded as a genius inventor, craftsman, and sculptor in his homeland of Athens. He invented carpentry and all the tools used for it. He designed the first bathhouse and the first dance floor. He made sculptures so lifelike that Hercules mistook them for actual men. Though skilled and celebrated, Daedalus was egotistical and jealous. Worried that his nephew was a more skillful craftsman, Daedalus murdered him. As punishment, Daedalus was banished from Athens and made his way to Crete. Preceded by his storied reputation, Daedalus was welcomed with open arms by Crete's King Minos. There, acting as the palace technical advisor, Daedalus continued to push the boundaries. For the king's children, he made mechanically animated toys that seemed alive. He invented the ship's sail and mast, which gave humans control over the wind. With every creation, Daedalus challenged human limitations that had so far kept mortals separate from gods, until finally, he broke right through. King Minos's wife, Pasiphaë, had been cursed by the god Poseidon to fall in love with the king's prized bull. Under this spell, she asked Daedalus to help her seduce it. With characteristic audacity, he agreed. Daedalus constructed a hollow wooden cow so realistic that it fooled the bull. With Pasiphaë hiding inside Daedalus's creation, she conceived and gave birth to the half-human half-bull minotaur. This, of course, enraged the king who blamed Daedalus for enabling such a horrible perversion of natural law. As punishment, Daedalus was forced to construct an inescapable labyrinth beneath the palace for the minotaur. When it was finished, Minos then imprisoned Daedalus and his only son Icarus within the top of the tallest tower on the island where they were to remain  for the rest of their lives. But Daedalus was still a genius inventor. While observing the birds that circled his prison, the means for escape became clear. He and Icarus would fly away from their prison as only birds or gods could do. Using feathers from the flocks that perched on the tower, and the wax from candles, Daedalus constructed two pairs of giant wings. As he strapped the wings to his son Icarus, he gave a warning: flying too near the ocean  would dampen the wings and make them too heavy to use. Flying too near the sun, the heat would melt the wax and the wings would disintegrate. In either case, they surely would die. Therefore, the key to their escape would be in keeping to the middle. With the instructions clear, both men leapt from the tower. They were the first mortals ever to fly. While Daedalus stayed carefully to the midway course, Icarus was overwhelmed with the ecstasy of flight and overcome with the feeling of divine power that came with it. Daedalus could only watch in horror as Icarus ascended higher and higher, powerless to change his son's dire fate. When the heat from the sun melted the wax on his wings, Icarus fell from the sky. Just as Daedalus had many times ignored the consequences of defying  the natural laws of mortal men in the service of his ego, Icarus was also carried away by his own hubris. In the end, both men paid for their departure from the path of moderation dearly, Icarus with his life and Daedalus with his regret. "

This vizier will serve as regent for the great explorer king managing the state while his master sails the ocean that encircles the earth and when the great king fails to return, this regent will take the throne the next year under the name Musa Keita. History will remember him as Mansa Musa. (music) Mansa Musa is often remembered for being the richest person in history And he was. By a wide margin. In fact, his wealth was so inconceivably vast that there is no accurate way of comparing it to modern standards. Jeff Bezos has like a fraction of the wealth Mansa Musa possessed. Europe at the time was not doing so great. The whole region was reeling from an economic crisis driven by plummeting gold and silver production. Meanwhile, Mali was drowning in the stuff. But Mansa Musa wanted Mali to be more than an economic superpower. He wanted it to be a great state recognized the world over. He spent the early years of his reign further consolidating the administration of the kingdom and developing the Empire's trade routes. He greenlit a military campaign to expand the empire east with an eye toward capturing the trade cities of Timbuktu and Gao. Then he turned his attention toward international matters, which also meant religion. Musa was a devout Muslim. In fact, probably more devout than his predecessors. But he was not above using religion as a political tool. Islam had made inroads with royalty in Sub-Saharan Africa specifically because it gave them access to things that made the state more efficient, like Arabic writing, religious law and Middle Eastern administrative practices, and of course, Mali's lucrative trans-Saharan trade was only possible because it was a Muslim nation like its trade partners. But despite economic might and religious prestige, Mali was something of a second class power treated as lesser than the kingdoms of its trade partners in North Africa. And that is something Mansa Musa could not abide. It was time Mali took its rightful place among the Muslim kingdoms. So, 17 years into his rule in 1324, Mansa Musa set off on the most extravagant Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, in the history of humanity. It was a trip calculated to attract the world's attention and put Mali on the map. Two other mansas had made the Hajj before but that was during a more chaotic time when the resources and ambitions of rulers were diverted to surviving war and famine. Musa's pilgrimage would be part religious journey, part publicity stunt. It was a statements to the Islamic world that the Mali Empire was thriving, devout and powerful. It was said that his glittering procession put even the Sun to shame. Wealth beyond dreams. Riches beyond imagination. Camels for days. Literally. Some accounts claim it took over a day for his opulent Caravan to pass. One account claims his retinue included over 60,000 people at its head were 500 heralds carrying gold staffs and a personal retinue of 12,000 servants dressed in silk and carrying gold bars. A baggage train of 600 camels followed each one carrying 300 pounds of gold dust. Musa brought along his wife and her 500 servants. And that was just the showy part. They took a baggage train with enough pack animals to carry provisions for the entire crew. At every step of the way, the well-dressed, generous and pious group made a favorable impression. Too favorable impression, in fact. To fulfill his religious duty to share his wealth for the poor, Musa gave handfuls of gold dust to beggars and passers-by. Some accounts claimed he built a mosque every Friday, and he spent months in the Cairo bazaars buying souvenirs at absurdly inflated prices. In fact, the emperor spent and gave away so much gold in Cairo, Medina and Mecca that he flooded the market crashing the metals value. Although Musa attempted to rectify this by quote: ""borrowing gold from money lenders in Cairo"" at an astronomical Interest, the value of gold still took over a decade to recover in the Middle East. Just think about that for a second. Mansa Musa was so rich that he caused a financial crisis by buying too many souvenirs on his religious roadtrip. But he had come all this way to make an impression and boy oh boy, did he achieve that. Centuries later, residents of Cairo were still telling stories of his pilgrimage train and their reports filtered to Europe through the traders of Venice. By 1375, European cartographers were producing world maps that featured Mali represented by Mansa Musa inspecting a gold nugget. But this gratuitous display wasn't just to show off. It was also to attract talent. On his return trip from Mecca, Mansa Musa brought Arab scholars, bureaucrats and architects with him in hopes of building Mali into an Islamic cultural and religious center. On his way back home, Mansa Musa took a different route. Through Timbuktu and Gow, which his armies had invaded and conquered while he had been away. And, let's just stop to think about that too Mansa Musa was so powerful that he could traipse off on a sweet pilgrimage party leaving the kingdom in the hands of his son with armies in the field for over a year and not get deposed. Historically speaking, that is pretty incredible. So, on his way back, he stopped at these new trading centers not just to bask in his new conquests, but to assess his new assets. Now, in addition to his Saharan trade centers in the west, he had two in the east that also sat on the Niger River. It was a good position for trade. But he wanted more. Timbuktu in particular would become a project of his and there he would put all of those new architects and scholars to work. Together they designed numerous buildings for the emperor including a new palace, mosques, libraries, universities and the Great Djinguereber Mosque at Timbuktu, which still stands today. This resulted in a boom of Islamic education in Mali and the influx of trained minds, artists and artisans brought increased commerce, and made Timbuktu a leading City the Islamic world And this was at a time when the most advanced nations in the world were Muslim from Spain to central India. Mali became the center for Islam in Sub-Saharan Africa missionizing its neighbors. It was said that while gold came from the south and salt from the north, knowledge came from Timbuktu. Because of its unique location near the Sahara Desert and on the Niger River, it was a melting pot and a hub of Intellectual and cultural exchange. Books were not only written in Timbuktu, but also imported from all over. There was an advanced book-copying industry there. And at a time when books were luxury goods, that were difficult and expensive to produce. And all of this was sparked by Mansa Musa's leadership in growing his empire. But while the Islamic accounts tell of Mansa Musa's great wealth and prestige, there was another perspective. local storytellers, the griots, who kept the oral history of Mali spoke of a different king: a foolish one who wasted the imperial treasury and coveted Islamic things abandoning the traditions of his people. So, perhaps, it's no accident that shortly after his death, the Mali Empire began it's slow collapse. (music) "
241,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,4DlipN61jGA,"An elderly woman named Rosalie  was sitting in her nursing home when her room suddenly burst  to life with twirling fabrics. Through the elaborate drapings, she could make out animals, children, and costumed characters. Rosalie was alarmed, not by the intrusion, but because she knew this entourage  was an extremely detailed hallucination. Her cognitive function was excellent, and she had not taken any medications that might cause hallucinations. Strangest of all, had a real-life crowd of circus performers burst into her room, she wouldn’t have been able to see them: she was completely blind. Rosalie had developed a condition known  as Charles Bonnet Syndrome, in which patients with either impaired  vision or total blindness suddenly hallucinate whole scenes  in vivid color. These hallucinations appear suddenly, and can last for mere minutes or recur for years. We still don’t fully understand what causes them to come and go, or why certain patients develop them when others don’t. We do know from fMRI studies  that these hallucinations activate the same brain areas as sight, areas that are not activated by imagination. Many other hallucinations,  including smells, sights, and sounds, also involve the same brain areas  as real sensory experiences. Because of this, the cerebral cortex is thought to play a part in hallucinations. This thin layer of grey matter covers the entire cerebrum, with different areas processing information from each of our senses. But even in people with completely unimpaired senses, the brain constructs the world we perceive from incomplete information. For example, our eyes have blind spots where the optic nerve  blocks part of the retina. When the visual cortex processes light  into coherent images, it fills in these blind spots with  information from the surrounding area. Occasionally, we might notice a glitch, but most of the time we’re none the wiser. When the visual cortex is deprived of input from the eyes, even temporarily, the brain still tries to create a coherent picture, but the limits of its abilities become a lot more obvious. The full-blown hallucinations of Charles Bonnet Syndrome are one example. Because Charles Bonnet Syndrome only occurs in people who had normal vision  and then lost their sight, not those who were born blind, scientists think the brain uses remembered images to compensate for  the lack of new visual input. And the same is true for other senses. People with hearing loss often hallucinate music or voices, sometimes as elaborate as the cacophony of an entire marching band. In addition to sensory deprivation, recreational and therapeutic drugs, conditions like epilepsy and narcolepsy, and psychiatric disorders  like schizophrenia, are a few of the many known causes  of hallucinations, and we’re still finding new ones. Some of the most notorious hallucinations are associated with drugs  like LSD and psilocybin. Their hallmark effects include  the sensation that dry objects are wet and that surfaces are breathing. At higher doses, the visual world can appear to melt, dissolve into swirls, or burst into fractal-like patterns. Evidence suggests these drugs also  act on the cerebral cortex. But while visual impairment typically  only causes visual hallucinations, and hearing loss auditory ones, substances like LSD cause perceptual disturbances across all the senses. That’s likely because they activate receptors in a broad range of brain areas, including the cortical regions for all the senses. LSD and psilocybin both function like serotonin in the brain, binding directly to one type of serotonin receptor in particular. While serotonin’s role in the brain is complex and poorly understood, it likely plays an important part in integrating information from the eyes, nose, ears, and other sensory organs. So one theory is that LSD and psilocybin cause hallucinations by disrupting the signaling  involved in sensory integration. Hallucinations associated  with schizophrenia may share a similar mechanism with those caused by LSD and psilocybin. Patients with schizophrenia often have elevated levels of serotonin in the brain. And antipsychotic drugs relieve symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking the same serotonin receptors LSD and psilocybin bind to. And, in some cases, these drugs can even relieve  the hallucinations of patients with Charles Bonnet Syndrome. We’re still a long way from understanding  all the different causes and interconnected mechanisms  of hallucinations. But it’s clear that hallucinatory experiences are much more closely tied to ordinary perception than we once thought. And by studying hallucinations, we stand to learn a great deal about how our brains construct  the world we see, hear, smell, and touch. As we learn more, we’ll likely come to appreciate just how subjective and individual each person’s island universe of perception really is. "
242,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,4b0SS8BKBbY,"A dwarf on a giant's shoulders  sees farther of the two... The red engine comes racing up,  its sirens screaming, skidding to a halt before the old house. The men come tumbling out of it in their uniforms and fire gear. A woman stands outside crying, judging. The men rush past her, up the stairs and to the attic. The attic door swings open, and books come tumbling out. For a moment, a book falls, open, into his hands. ""Time has fallen asleep in the afternoon sunshine."" [Shudders.] He drops the book in fear and disgust. They open up their hoses, kerosene, not water. The books pages crinkle with the moisture, and the men back out of the home. It's time for their last act. But the woman was not supposed to be there. The police were supposed to pick her up long ago. Still, she stands there. The captain yells for her to move. Starts counting to ten. They can't do their job until she leaves.  They're firemen, after all. The captain is halfway through his count. Then it happens. The woman holds up one singular, slender match. "" 'Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.' "" [Flames.] *Extra Sci Fi intro theme* That previous scene is perhaps the most pivotal in Ray Bradbury's masterpiece Fahrenheit 451. Because it begins the protagonist's long journey to answer the question: Might these books, these fragile things that every night they burn, be worth protecting, even at the cost of life itself. On the broadest level, this is the story of Guy Montag. A ""fireman"" in a society where books are banned. Here, only comics, cheap interactive TV, and pornography is allowed. Whenever books are found, the firemen are called to burn the books, and whatever place was hiding them, to the ground. Early on Montag is fine with this. He sees it as a good and honorable job. And he's bought into society's propaganda that books warped the mind and break down the social order. But over time, he secretly begins to keep some of the books he was supposed to burn. Curious as to why people would risk so much for a stack of paper, he begins reading them. And at last he rebels against the society he's in, fleeing his city and meeting others like him, who after a one-day atomic war that decimates the unreading, unthinking world that he came from, begin to rebuild society once more. But as Bradbury himself acknowledged, this book is about many things. In his younger days just coming out of the McCarthy era, he said the book was about censorship and book burning. However, later in his life, he said it was about the dangers of easy entertainment. So let's take both of those viewpoints and break them down a bit. The book itself is an abundantly clear condemnation of book burning and censorship. But what's most interesting is Bradbury's own commentary on it. Because even though he lived through the McCarthy era and the Red Scare, he said that censorship came from us. That the government couldn't censor things, at least not for long, if we as a populace didn't want them to. More than that, though, he made an impassioned argument for being careful about 𝘩𝘰𝘸 we censor. He said that if every group got to pull out of books everything that offended them or that they just didn't like, we'd soon be left  with just empty covers. He also made a somewhat naive argument that if groups didn't like what a book said, rather than censor those books, they should just write their own. Of course, he really didn't take into account the fact that some groups may face more obstacles than others when it comes to things like getting books into mass distribution, or that ideologies like fascism and McCarthyism, both of which he despised, came from people publishing unchecked things which advocated the silencing of others. But his fundamental point was still worthwhile Without us embracing the book burning of the Nazis or the Bonfire of the Vanities, without us welcoming the historical revisionism that rewrites textbooks around the world, without us asking the government, albeit not explicitly, to censor the things we don't want to believe or find objectionable. Censorship on a broad scale is impossible to sustain. And it's not only governments. Before this type of censorship even hits the government level, we do it to ourselves on smaller levels. Fahrenheit 451 itself was censored by the publisher in 75 places over the years, without the author's consent, because concerned parents wrote in about the swear words or depictions of drunkenness. But then there's that other point that Bradbury wanted to make. The point about easy-to-consume media slowly dumbing down what we consume, until all we consume is nothing of worth. And on this, he's both heinously wrong and absolutely right. Because ease of consumption isn't the problem. It's the content, the dumbing down 𝘧𝘰𝘳 ease of consumption, which in the end, may take away something from us all. And it's funny, because this idea came to him as he saw a woman walking with a handheld radio one day. She was oblivious to the world around her, as she was so wrapped up in whatever she was listening to. Bradbury thought of her like a zombie: tuned out from the world, and tuned in to an easy escape. Imagine how horrified he'd be by our smartphones. Whoo. But the problem here is that he didn't know 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 she was listening to. She could have been listening to the Royal Shakespeare Company doing a rendition of Hamlet or Macbeth. And this is the problem with everyone who judges things by the medium they're rendered in rather than the quality of the work. Over the 20th century, we've learned how to make media much easier to consume. We've come to a better understanding of the human psyche, and created new techniques for keeping us engaged. And, in general, comic books, television, and video games today are way easier to consume than say, picking up Milton. But that doesn't mean that they're inherently less worthwhile. And in each of those previously listed forms of media, you can find works as impactful as Paradise Lost. And for James personally, Paradise Lost was a tour de force that changed how he thought about a lot of things. And yet that statement holds true. The danger we have to avoid is simply being lazy in what we produce and what we consume, because there are games and comics that challenge us, and make us rethink our perceptions. And there's anime and TV that forces us to watch intently, and to analyze, deconstruct, and dissect what we're viewing. Bradbury's fear is that we'll choose what requires the least of us and that companies will cater to that desire. But that's not a problem with the mediums we choose or develop themselves. That's a problem with us. *Extra Sci Fi ending theme* To avoid the dangerously vapid dystopia Bradbury presents us, we don't have to abandon new media. We simply have to look for the things that challenge us in all of the mediums we consume. *Extra Sci Fi ending theme* [Pop.] *Extra Sci Fi ending theme* [Subtitles credits: 雜碎 Chop Suey] [Translation credits: ] "
243,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,5j9Syov0AAw,"Humans know the surprising prick of a needle, the searing pain of a stubbed toe, and the throbbing of a toothache. We can identify many types of pain and have multiple ways of treating it. But what about other species? How do the animals all around us experience pain? It's important that we find out. We keep animals as pets, they enrich our environment, we farm many species for food, and we use them in experiments to advance science and human health. Animals are clearly important to us, so it's equally important that we avoid causing them unnecessary pain. For animals that are similar to us, like mammals, it's often obvious when they're hurting. But there's a lot that isn't obvious, like whether pain relievers that work on us also help them. And the more different  an animal is from us, the harder it is to understand their experience. How do you tell whether  a shrimp is in pain? A snake? A snail? In vertebrates, including humans, pain can be split into two distinct processes. In first, nerves and the skin sense something harmful and communicate that information to the spinal cord. There, motor neurons activate movements that make us rapidly jerk away from the threat. This is the physical recognition of harm called nociception, and nearly all animals, even those with very simple nervous systems, experience it. Without this ability, animals would be unable to avoid harm and their survival would be threatened. The second part is the conscious recognition of harm. In humans, this occurs when the sensory neurons in our skin make a second round of connections via the spinal cord to the brain. There, millions of neurons in multiple regions create the sensations of pain. For us, this is a very complex experience associated with emotions like fear, panic, and stress, which we can communicate to others. But it's harder to know exactly how animals experience this part of the process because most them can't show us what they feel. However, we get clues from observing how animals behave. Wild, hurt animals are known to nurse their wounds, make noises to show their distress, and become reclusive. In the lab, scientists have discovered that animals like chickens and rats will self-administer pain-reducing drugs if they're hurting. Animals also avoid situations where they've been hurt before, which suggests awareness of threats. We've reached the point that research has made us so sure that vertebrates recognize pain that it's illegal in many countries to needlessly harm these animals. But what about other types of animals like invertebrates? These animals aren't legally protected, partly because their behaviors are harder to read. We can make good guesses about some of them, like oysters, worms, and jellyfish. These are examples of animals that either lack a brain or have a very simple one. So an oyster may recoil when squirted with lemon juice, for instance, because of nociception. But with such a simple nervous system, it's unlikely to experience the conscious part of pain. Other invertebrate animals are more complicated, though, like the octopus, which has a sophisticated brain and is thought to be one of the most  intelligent invertebrate animals. Yet, in many countries, people continue the practice of eating live octopus. We also boil live crawfish, shrimp,  and crabs even though we don't really know how they're affected either. This poses an ethical problem because we may be causing these animals unnecessary suffering. Scientific experimentation, though controversial, gives us some clues. Tests on hermit crabs show that they'll leave an undesirable shell if they're zapped with electricity but stay if it's a good shell. And octopi that may originally curl up an injured arm to protect it will risk using it to catch prey. That suggests that these animals make value judgements around sensory input instead of just reacting reflexively to harm. Meanwhile, crabs have been known to repeatedly rub a spot on their bodies where they've received an electric shock. And even sea slugs flinch when they know they're about  to receive a noxious stimulus. That means they have some memory of physical sensations. We still have a lot to learn about animal pain. As our knowledge grows, it may one day allow us to live in a world where we don't cause pain needlessly. "
244,Education,27,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,5v13wrVEQ2M,"These photos look like they’re from a hotel, or a fancy college dorm room. There’s a gym, common areas, and private bedrooms. But this place, just outside Halden, Norway, is a prison. There’s no barbed wire, lots of greenery, and striking contemporary art. Inmates even have pretty great views out of their cell windows. It’s all part of a plan to make prisons more humane — through design. The underlying philosophy behind humane prison design argues that the look and feel of a prison shouldn’t be a punishment. And the first thing designers focus on is the basic architecture of prison buildings. In most prison architecture, facilities are consolidated into one contiguous building. A courtyard design uses a rectangular building around a central outdoor space. In a telephone pole design, rows of buildings are stacked like a ladder. And radial designs have corridors that branch out from a central hub, like spokes on a wheel. While these layouts are good for moving lots of inmates around efficiently, they restrict prisoners to identical indoor hallways day after day, and tight quarters can unintentionally create tension and conflict. So humane prisons are often laid out in a campus design, where facilities are split between separate buildings, with a surrounding perimeter wall. At Norway’s Halden Prison, housing is located here, while education and visitation spaces are here, in separate buildings. This means most inmates have to start their day with a commute — mimicking life in the outside world and providing easy access to outdoor physical activity. And unlike other layouts, which have windows that look out onto the prison itself, campus design gives inmates a rich view of their surrounding environment. This access to nature also helps inmates track the passage of time. Spending time outside and seeing days and seasons pass through windows helps reduce this problem. Plus, the grounds of humane prisons are usually landscaped carefully. At Halden, tall birch and pine trees dwarf the buildings and obscure the perimeter wall, lending what designers call an “anti-authoritarian” feel to the campus: inmates are never made to feel intimidated by the architecture itself. Building materials influence humane design too. In other prisons, interiors are made from hard materials like concrete, linoleum, and steel. Materials like this block light, are visually unappealing, and constantly reflect noise. In prisons like Halden, you’ll see glass to let in natural light, and materials like cork and wood to muffle noise. But humane prison design isn’t just about architecture and materials. It’s also about what happens inside the walls. Halden’s design affects the way correctional officers and inmates interact. Because housing is broken up into small communities with a shared kitchen and communal space, correctional officers can easily monitor inmates through regular face-to-face contact, instead of observing large groups of people from a distance. And the guards’ rooms are intentionally designed too small, to incentivize them to move out into the inmates’ common area. Campus layouts help that relationship flourish: A study of architecture in Dutch correctional facilities found that campus design ranked highest in inmate-staff relationships. And US prison studies from the late ‘90s found that this style of direct contact resulted in fewer violent or security-related incidents. Designing these humane prisons costs money. Which is why most of the groundbreaking work is happening in Western Europe and Scandinavia, where smaller prison populations and more robust social support systems allow for more flexible experimentation. And because US prisons often prize cost-saving over design, it’s still uncommon to see them here. But places like Halden are setting a new precedent for what the prison of the future could look like. It might feel counterintuitive to create pleasant, well-designed spaces like this for people who have committed crimes. But under a design philosophy like this, being imprisoned is the punishment — the architecture doesn’t have to be. "
245,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,6DP8INm09nY,"July, 1846. Ireland's early summer harvest is starting to come in. Reports of blight circulate, but in the east, summer has been temperate. The hunger might be over. Lightning rends the sky. Water drops like a guillotine. An unhealthy fog blankets the land, and upon seeing it, one fisherman tells a newspaper that it's ""the wrath of the fairies."" ""I knew it by the signs they were coming."" And perhaps he's not far off... because a tiny malicious organism is riding the rain. The water washes fungus spores off the infected leaves, carrying it to the ground. And under the soil, the 1846 potato crop begins to decay. In January 1846, Daniel O'Connell had stood in Parliament, and warned that Peel was not doing enough to fight the famine. ""There are 5 million people on the verge of starvation,"" he warned, ""and I'm speaking from the depth of my conviction when I say,"" ""I believe the result of neglect will be death to an enormous amount."" Now, eight months later... Peel was gone, and the government was doing even less. Hunger began pulling Ireland apart. Mothers starved until their milk gave out and their babies died. Men who had survived off food depots and public work projects found succor in neither. Orders had been given to food depots to preserve their grain until December. It didn't matter. People arrived at the depots on foot, shoeless, having not eaten in days. Depots relented and passed out cornmeal, but their reserves were getting low. Gangs of men, carrying shovels, marched into market towns, demanding work. Food availability was not the problem. Amid the famine, bread sat in shop windows, and Irish merchants exported tons of beef, grain and oats to England. The government refused to intervene, so, across the island, starving peasants did instead. In County Waterford, an armed militia blocked two barges that were transporting Irish grain for export. That done, they moved into the town, beating merchants, stealing bread, and lighting buildings afire. A unit of dragoons ordered them to disperse. When they didn't, the soldiers opened fire. Six bodies lay in the street. Yet as Ireland reeled towards famine, in London, Sir Charles Trevelyan was retooling his relief plan to be less generous. Trevelyan was a legend in the civil service: incorruptible, pious, and hard-working. But he was also a workaholic micromanager, steeped in the Victorian belief that poverty was the sign of moral failure. To Trevelyan, the ""Irish problem,"" the fact that Ireland remained trapped in a cycle of poverty, violence, and rebellion, lay in the Irish character. ""They were lazy, rebellious, and took no initiative,"" he thought. Potato cultivation was too easy, only requiring a few months labor a year, breeding idleness. And, it was prone to failure. And when it failed, the Irish turned to government to feed them. Absent or neglectful Irish landowners shouldered little of the cost, and London feared that the Irish were becoming habitually dependent on government aid. ""To save Ireland,"" he thought, ""it needed modernization and agricultural reform."" He dreamed of an anglicized Ireland, like the one that existed in its cities and market towns, one with English style capitalism and a market economy, like theirs, to serve as a trade partner. He wanted to sweep out Ireland's communal village life and barter system, replacing it with a workforce that worked for wages rather than potatoes. One where they earned money to buy food. Trevelyan saw this blight, not as a disaster, but a god-sent opportunity to remake Irish society. And he was determined to make the most of it, no matter how much suffering he had to inflict. Great guy. *sarcasm* In fact, Trevelyan had studied under the economist Thomas Malthus, who argued that when a population outstripped food production, starvation and death was a natural and proper correction. When Malthus put forth the theory, he was thinking of Ireland, and Trevelyan agreed. That belief in Malthusian principles, alongside a commitment to non intervention in the free market, would plunge Ireland deep into famine. So when Trevelyan rolled out his reformed relief plan, it was no surprise that its primary mission was not to feed the starving, but instead to protect the free market, prevent abuse, and teach economic lessons. When food depots reopened, the poor found that the cornmeal was no longer sold at cost. That, argued Trevelyan, undercut local merchants. Now, it was market price. All food depots would close, except those in the west, and Trevelyan insisted that any maize purchased come from British merchants, not American ones. When the public works began again, job seekers discovered their new wages were based on performance rather than a flat daily fee, and even the highest wages couldn't feed a family. The wages themselves were supposedly funded via attacks on Irish landlords, but many landlords had little to spare. And due to multiple levels of bureaucracy, meant to prevent fraud, the road crews’ wages often took weeks to arrive. And finally, there would be no intervention in food prices. Laissez-faire economics would rule. High prices, Trevelyan argued, would attract food imports. But,  you guessed it, they didn't. In fact, food prices had soared higher than ever. It had been a bad year for agriculture, and not just in Ireland. Crops failed across Europe. Countries scrambled to import extra food, and Trevelyan was late to refill his cornmeal. So by the time he, grudgingly, started looking, there was little to be had. And in Ireland, potato and cornmeal prices doubled. At government food depots, hungry people arrived from miles away, only to find the maize unaffordable. Across the island, small farmers and landless agricultural workers were plunged into immediate destitution. They surged into market towns to beg for food at depots, and they even began entering the hated workhouses, a government poor-relief program best described as a prison for the poor, where they lived while performing mindless work in exchange for two meals a day. And workhouses were abusive and inhumane by design, so the poor would only enter as a last resort. Yet even they were over capacity. Despite the people's desperation, landlords upped the eviction rate, calling in police and soldiers to throw families out, and demolish their homes with the sledgehammer and crowbar. Tenants killed livestock in retribution, and on occasion, ambushed and murdered landlords. Evicted families wandered the roads, pitching tents in ditches. Crime rates doubled. This was the season of the gunman. And it wasn't just the small tenant farmers and landless laborers showing up at the food depots. Managers reported small landowners, 10 to 15 acre men, approaching them to request aid, fine clothes hanging off their skeletal frames. One had even walked 12 miles to an unfamiliar town, rather than reveal to his neighbors that he'd gone bankrupt. Blight compounded everything. In small farms, barley rotted in the field. Usually, farmers paid laborers to harvest, but they had neither money nor potatoes to offer. And as if that wasn't enough, that winter, a series of blizzards ravaged the island, snow stacking to the rooftops, entombing whole villages. Soon, the New Year dawned on what would be known as Black '47. January brought a strange frenzy: families, hollowed eyed and losing hair, stumbled to the shore to eat seaweed and oysters. They scaled 300-foot cliffs just to steal bird eggs. They could have survived off fish, but they had neither the equipment, boats, nor skill for deepwater fishing. And by that time, most of the fishermen had pawned their nets for cornmeal. Armed gangs ambushed government food convoys and butchered stolen cattle to survive. By the end of January, 700,000 had turned to working on public works. These ""famine roads"" were often a waste: they started nowhere and went nowhere. Malnourished work gangs broke rocks in freezing temperatures, their shoes and coats long ago lost to the pawnshop. And, they died there, in great numbers, collapsing beside the roads from exhaustion. Violence against public works managers became so pervasive, that many deserted their posts, while others, laden with guilt, ended their own lives. In a famine, it's not the starvation that kills you. It's the diseases that follow: typhus, dysentery, fever, and the famine dropsy. Peasants fleeing the countryside carried them into cities. And infection ran so rampant in work. houses, the staff began to quit. Visitors and officials reported seeing villages where the want was so extreme, that families lacked the energy to even bury their dead. The Irish funeral, so embodied in the culture, disappeared piece by piece. No one wanted to gather, for fear of the fevers. None could afford a coffin, and eventually, even individual graves were dispensed with. Dogs scavenged the burial fields. Amid that landscape of horror, one place stood out as particularly destitute: Skibbereen, in County Cork, became internationally famous for its deplorable conditions. Drought exacerbated the famine, and after a few months, the frantic scramble to survive had passed, leaving only a lethargic wait for the grave. Families crawled across their cabins, too weak to even walk, and a visiting American found himself in a surreal conversation with two young women, as they casually calculated how many days they had left to live. Fourteen, they agreed. Accounts from Skibbereen made the village internationally famous, the face of the great hunger,  and its ghoulish tales, repeated in newspapers, inspired people around the globe to raise money for famine relief. Donations came from as far away as Australia, and in the United States, even enslaved people and Native Americans raised funds for Ireland. The international outcry finally pushed Trevelyan to act. For months, he’d downplayed the increasingly urgent and alarming reports from his own officers on the ground, even when they'd rebelled against his policies, selling cornmeal at cost or serving free meals at workhouses. He relented. The British government would support outdoor relief, the opening of soup kitchens, and free meal distribution. But, it was too little, too late: deep famine had already affected the planting season, and the next crop would be poor. Many Irish decided they only had two options: either fight for Ireland, or leave it. "
246,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,6Gzss-iVd1g," At a young age, Catherine had been married to an emotionally-stunted young man who never loved her. For years, she had remained trapped, until she was won over by a callous rake, who later abandoned her. She then met a man of whom she was very fond, and whom she would eventually make the king of Poland, But none of these men had truly won her heart. No, the man to be her first great love turned out to be the same man who had helped her ascend the throne years before – Grigory Orlov. For 13 years she was faithful to him, but that was soon to end. [Intro music] Grigory Orlov was brave and bold, never flinching at danger or personal risk. But he was also boorish, rude, and impertinent. He was ill-educated with no interest in any of the Enlightenment ideas that Catherine so fancied. Catherine would once write that despite it all, she would have stayed with him for a lifetime, if only he stayed with her. But Gregory sought danger; he was restless, unfaithful, and worst of all to Catherine, he had grown distant. She sent him off on a diplomatic mission. There, he failed, displaying the same arrogance that he had displayed at court. The same uncouth rudeness and sense of superiority that had gotten him hated by her nobles. But it didn't really matter at this point. Catherine had sent him away because she was already done with him. Too long had she suffered his infidelity, his harsh words, his sense that he was superior to the Empress herself. As his replacement, Catherine picked up a safe, pretty, dull young man, who she would rapidly come to call the most boring man in all of Russia. She found her time with him interminable. Not because he didn't try, and not because he was unrefined, like Orlov. But because he never had anything interesting to say. But then she found Potemkin. He had first caught her attention by giving her his sword knot, on the day she took the throne. He had performed numerous services for Catherine: he'd been her envoy to Sweden, bringing word of the palace coup, he had been her lay representative on the Most Holy Synod, he'd been paymaster of the army, and he'd even been appointed as guardian of ""exotic peoples,"" at Catherine's great assembly on laws. He had served valiantly in the Turkish war, and won himself renown at every turn. He was a cultured man, not only well-studied, but intellectually eager and curious. He had won the top honors at university and then, dropped out. He loved theology, but always, especially after being appointed guardian of exotic peoples, kept the company not only of Orthodox ministers, but also rabbis, Old Believers, Cossacks and even members of the tribal religions still alive in the more remote parts of Russia. He was a great wit, known for impressions and being able to mimic people's voices which I guess was considered high comedy in those days He could make Catherine laugh, and through humor, he could say to her what others couldn't say. He was bold, decisive and highly competent. And soon, Catherine fell in love with him. He was the love of her life. She probably married him; it's one of history's great mysteries as the wedding would've had to have been a secret and no documents of the event survive. But in her correspondence, she starts referring to him all the time as her husband and to herself as his wife. He was the first man who she felt was her equal, at least in everything but rank. And he was active in all aspects of court and governance, helping her to execute her will. But, and tragically for Catherine, there is always a but(t), he was deeply insecure about their difference in power. For all his qualities, Potemkin could never get over the fact that she could make or unmake him in an instant if she wished. That all the power in their relationship was firmly on her side. Every day, he required assurances that she wasn't going to leave him. When she paid attention to any of her former lovers, his jealousy flared. So certain he was that she was about to cast him aside for an old favorite. He alternated between melancholy and anger, and nothing she could ever do could convince him that he wasn't just a passing fancy, that he really was what she wanted. And in time, the strain of this broke them. Things got miserable. She spent days in tears, and he, hiding in work or in another part of the palace. Passion and love were still there but they were translated into recriminations and bitterness At last she finally decided to see other people, but rather than this destroying what they had, it strengthened them. While their physical relationship was done, they maintained an incredibly strong bond that simply grew as Potemkin came into his own, not at her lover but as her minister. Catherine would abandon lovers if they spoke ill of Potemkin or were jealous of the space he had in her heart. And Potemkin would serve her loyally all his life, even introducing her to young men with whom he thought she might fall in love. Their loyalty to each other would overrule any other relationship, and any other concern. And from here, they could turn to external affairs. Catherine dispatched Potemkin to deliver one of the largest series of territorial gains in Russian history. As part of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca that ended the first Ottoman war, the Crimean Khanate was guaranteed independence from the Ottomans. A guarantee that was backed by the might of Russia But Catherine and Potemkin saw an opportunity. The great powers of Europe were embroiled in other wars. No one would be able to raise more than a meek protest if faraway Russia expanded her empire. And so they struck while the iron was hot, and annexed the Crimean Khanate, an action whose consequences reverberate through to today. Soon after, they moved to annex the kingdom of Georgia and as no one had raised an objection to the bloodless takeover of Crimea, Catherine and Potemkin were sure that there would be even less objection to this expansion into a little-thought-of territory to Russia's south. And they were almost right. No one in Europe really did much about it but there was one group that cared and that was the Chechens. And so, this action too would have consequences that would echo into today. Potemkin was then set to rule the south of Russia: to build cities and bring colonists into these new areas, to pacify hostile tribes, and create a new and mighty black sea fleet. And though all of these expansions brought Russia back into conflict with the Ottoman Empire, where Potemkin had previously been but one of a myriad of generals in the first conflict, here he was supreme commander. He led with aplomb, delivering a number of smashing victories to Catherine but shortly thereafter, he fell ill and passed, dictating only one last letter to Catherine before death took him. He was a man of luxury and debauchery, of unswerving faithfulness on utter profligacy, of towering ego and absolute insecurity with appetites to match his intellect and his ability. But perhaps the Austrian Field Marshal Ligne who put it best: ""I here behold a commander-in-chief who looks idle and is always busy who has no other desk than his knees, no other comb than his fingers; constantly reclined on his couch yet sleeping neither in night nor in daytime. A cannon shot, to which he himself is not exposed, disturbs him with the idea that it costs the life of some of his soldiers. Trembling for others, brave himself, alarmed at the approach of danger, frolicsome when it surrounds him, dull in the midst of pleasure, surfeited with everything, easily disgusted, morose, inconstant, a profound philosopher, a profound philosopher, an able minister, a sublime politician, not revengeful, asking pardon for a pain he has inflicted, quickly repairing an injustice, thinking he loves God when he fears the Devil; waving one hand to the females that please him, and with the other making the sign of the cross; receiving numberless presents from his sovereign and distributing them immediately to others; preferring prodigality in giving, to regularity in paying; prodigiously rich and not worth a farthing; easily prejudiced in favor of or against anything; talking divinity to his generals and tactics to his bishops; never reading, but pumping everyone with whom he converses; uncommonly affable or extremely savage, the most attractive or most repulsive of manners; concealing under the appearance of harshness, the greatest benevolence of heart, like a child, wanting to have everything, or, like a great man, knowing how to do without; gnawing his fingers, or apples, or turnips; scolding or laughing; engaged in wantonness or in prayers, summoning twenty aides de camp and saying nothing to any of them, not caring for cold, though he appears unable to exist without furs; always in his shirt without pants, or in rich regimentals; barefoot or in slippers; almost bent double when he is at home, and tall, erect, proud, handsome, noble, majestic when he shows himself to his army like Agamemnon in the midst of the monarchs of Greece. What then is his magic? Genius, Genius, natural abilities, Genius, natural abilities, an excellent memory, Genius, natural abilities, an excellent memory, artifice without craft, Genius, natural abilities, an excellent memory, artifice without craft, the art of conquering every heart; much generosity, much generosity, graciousness, and justice in his rewards; and a consummate knowledge of mankind."" However you view him, he served Catherine to the end and in the end, he was the love of her life. Before his death though, there was one thing that Potemkin didn't get to resolve. And that was the matter of Poland. Join us next time as we delve into the disappearance of Poland from the map of Europe until 1918 the shifting alliances of Austria, Prussia and Russia and the last days of Catherine and the succession to her throne.

247,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,6PiyUjVxukI,"The universe began its  cosmic life in a big bang nearly fourteen billion years ago, and has been expanding  ever since. But what is it expanding into? That's a complicated question. Here's why: Einstein's equations of general relativity describe space and time as a kind of inter-connected fabric for the universe. This means that what we know of as space and time exist only as part of the universe and not beyond it. Now, when everyday objects expand, they move out into more space. But if there is no such thing as space to expand into, what does expanding  even mean? In 1929 Edwin Hubble's astronomy observations gave us a definitive answer. His survey of the night sky found all faraway galaxies recede, or move away, from the Earth. Moreover, the further the galaxy,  the faster it recedes. How can we interpret this? Consider a loaf of raisin bread rising in the oven. The batter rises by the same amount in between each and every raisin. If we think of raisins as a  stand-in for galaxies, and batter as the space between them, we can imagine that the stretching or expansion of intergalactic space will make  the galaxies recede from each other, and for any galaxy, its faraway neighbors will recede a larger distance than the nearby ones in the same amount of time. Sure enough, the equations of general relativity predict a cosmic tug-of-war between gravity  and expansion. It's only in the dark void between galaxies where expansion wins out, and space stretches. So there's our answer. The universe is expanding  unto itself. That said, cosmologists are pushing the limits of mathematical models to speculate on what, if anything, exists beyond our spacetime. These aren't wild guesses, but hypotheses that tackle kinks in the scientific theory of the Big Bang. The Big Bang predicts matter to be  distributed evenly across the universe, as a sparse gas --but then, how  did galaxies and stars come to be? The inflationary model  describes a brief era of incredibly rapid expansion that relates quantum fluctuations  in the energy of the early universe, to the formation of clumps of gas  that eventually led to galaxies. If we accept this paradigm, it may  also imply our universe represents one region in a greater cosmic reality that undergoes endless, eternal inflation. We know nothing of this speculative inflating reality, save for the mathematical prediction that its endless expansion may be driven by an unstable  quantum energy state. In many local regions, however,  the energy may settle by random chance into a stable state, stopping  inflation and forming bubble universes. Each bubble universe —ours being one of them —would be described by its own Big Bang and laws of physics. Our universe would be part of a greater multiverse, in which the fantastic rate of eternal inflation makes it impossible for us to encounter a neighbor universe. The Big Bang also predicts that in the early, hot universe, our fundamental forces may unify into one super-force. Mathematical string theories suggest  descriptions of this unification, in addition to a fundamental structure  for sub-atomic quarks and electrons. In these proposed models, vibrating strings are the building blocks of the universe. Competing models for strings have now been consolidated into a unified description, and suggest these structures may interact with massive, higher dimensional surfaces called branes. Our universe may be contained  within one such brane, floating in an unknown higher dimensional place, playfully named “the bulk,” or hyperspace. Other branes—containing other types of  universes—may co-exist in hyperspace, and neighboring branes may even share  certain fundamental forces like gravity. Both eternal inflation and branes  describe a multiverse, but while universes in eternal inflation are isolated, brane universes could bump into each other. An echo of such a collision may appear  in the cosmic microwave background —a soup of radiation throughout our universe, that’s a relic from an early Big Bang era. So far, though, we’ve found no such cosmic echo. Some suspect these differing multiverse hypotheses may eventually coalesce into a common description, or be replaced by something else. As it stands now, they’re speculative explorations of mathematical models. While these models are inspired and guided by many scientific experiments, there are very few objective experiments to directly test them, yet. Until the next Edwin Hubble comes along, scientists will likely be left to argue about the elegance of their competing models… and continue to dream about what, if anything, lies beyond our universe.

248,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,6QaBYLAOaSY,"In 1687, a court convicts a young woman of kidnapping, body snatching and arson. They sentence her to burn at the stake. But they convict an empty chair. Julie d'Aubigny, see, never shows up to court. She's too busy fighting tavern duels and living on the run with her girlfriend. And instead of an execution, She'll get a starring role at the Paris Opera. Who was this remarkable woman and what was going on in France that allowed her to not just exist openly, but rise in society? Buckle up. Have we got a wild story for you! Julie's life began in unusual circumstances. She grew up in Versailles, the daughter of a middle-class family who worked for the king. But her father wasn't just any run-of-the-mill servant or bureaucrat. He was the Secretary to the Comte d'Armagnac: the King's master of the horse. Basically, that means her father trained court pages and worked for the guy who is responsible for the royal stables and the King's retinue. The royal stables didn't just house horses. They were a bustling and critical part of life in Versailles, where over a thousand blacksmiths, servants, servants, saddlers, servants, saddlers, coachmen, servants, saddlers, coachmen, and other employees kept the Royal horses ready for the King's next trip, hunting party, or war. And Julie lived in this rough-and-tumble environment from the age of nine. There, she studied alongside the court pages who'd go on to serve in Louis XIV's court. And in doing so she quickly mastered the courtly arts of reading, And in doing so she quickly mastered the courtly arts of reading, horseback riding, And in doing so she quickly mastered the courtly arts of reading, horseback riding, drawing, And in doing so she quickly mastered the courtly arts of reading, horseback riding, drawing, dancing, and especially, swordsmanship. The Comte took her as a mistress when she was 14 and, as was common in the time, Arranged for her to marry a man named Mo Pan to keep up appearances. Shortly after the wedding, the Comte arranged for Monsieur Mo Pan to transfer to a cushy job in the south. But Julie refused to go with her new husband, opting to stay in Paris. That is, until she ditched the Comte d'Armagnac for a fencing master. Not long into their relationship, her new paramour killed a man in an illegal duel and had to flee Versailles. Julie, ever up for an adventure, put on men's clothes and joined her lover on the run. For the next few months Julie and her fencing master tavern-hopped across France Traveling, Traveling, partying, Traveling, partying and fighting duels. To help finance their lifestyle, she reinvented herself as a sort of traveling-singer-slash-exhibition-duelist, but as they traveled France, Julie began to tire of her sword master and soon ditched him in favor of a girl she'd met on the road. As you can imagine, folks weren't super comfortable with gay relationships back in 17th century France, especially not when it meant their daughter was carrying on with a disreputable, cross-dressing duelist known for winning fistfights. So the girl's parents did what most families did with misbehaving daughters: They stashed her in a convent. That, they thought, would solve the problem. Clearly they had no idea who they were dealing with. Julie had a plan. Julie always had a plan.(TM) A very wild, slightly unhinged plan. Step one: take the Holy Orders and enter the convent. Step two: steal a body of a recently deceased nun and stash it in her lover's bedroom. Step three: Light the room on fire, grab the girl, and disappear into the night. Step 4: Proceed to gallivant across the countryside with her supposedly-dead girlfriend as her new sidekick. Remarkably, the plan worked. At least, for a while. After three months of adventure, Julie's girlfriend decided she'd had enough and went back home, Shocking her parents by turning up on their doorstep very much alive. Her parents took the case to court and got Julie convicted in absentia; She'd be burned at the stake. If anyone could catch her. That series of events is bonkers even by today's standards. So what was it about 17th century France that allowed a person like Julie not just to exist, but to thrive? Surprisingly, it had a lot to do with the king: Louis the 14th. King Louis came to the throne at the age of four during a period of aristocratic rebellions protesting royal encroachment on the rights of nobility. As a result Louis spent a lifetime centralizing power in the monarchy and casting himself as a divine right monarch. Part of this project involved using opulence and artistic patronage as a way to communicate his god-given power to the public, the nobility and the church. And that last one was important because while Louis was devoutly religious, he also didn't want church officials meddling in political affairs. The concept of divine right monarchy itself challenged church authority after all, and helped the King avoid getting undermined by powerful Popes and Cardinals. It made a strange situation where the church and crown were simultaneously partners and rivals for power. And this rivalry played out in the world of artistic patronage. Louis realized that if he underwrote artists that were critical of power structures they would focus their ire on the church instead of the throne. Therefore it was in his best interest to encourage artists who were irreverent, satirical or even scandalous. People, in short, like Julie. And as it happened the newly single Julie wanted to make a career move. She wrote to the Comte d'Armagnac, asking if he could arrange a position for her at the Paris Opera and the count petitioned the king on her behalf. Louis found her story so amusing that he personally pardoned her so she could take the stage. Louis himself had founded the Opera which was a unique combination of a public theater and a Royal Academy for the Arts. Sometimes the king himself even starred in plays including theatrical propaganda designed to direct and influence public opinion. He also loved to dance, and despite ill health performed in ballets extensively throughout his life. The Opera was not just artistically significant, but socially and politically meaningful as well. And Julie wasted no time in making waves there. She debuted as Pallas Athena: the Goddess of War, and quickly became an in-demand Talent. She had an ability to quickly memorize lines and audiences loved her androgynous look and fencing skill! Backstage she fought duels or slept with many of her co-stars regardless of gender and several of her most famous relationships began after crossing swords over a quarrel. In one famous incident she publicly beat an actor for pestering her fellow actresses before a show. It might surprise you to hear that Julie never hid her bisexuality during her years on stage. In fact, she enjoyed a certain amount of royal protection. Although both gay and straight affairs were not uncommon at the time, mainstream public and religious opinions were still vehemently opposed to bisexuality and homosexuality. But there was a caveat. Louis XIV's own brother was gay and known to be generally effeminate and cross-dress. Therefore louis couldn't crack down on homosexuality without there being consequences for his brother Meaning it was an unusually lenient time. But that protection wasn't limitless and eventually Julie pushed things too far even for the king. In  1695 Louie's brother Philippe invited Julie to a royal ball as his guest. She arrived dressed as a man and danced with women throughout the night. This certainly ruffled some feathers. But the breaking point came when she kissed a desirable single marquise that several gentlemen were courting. Three of those suitors challenged Julie to a duel on the spot. She walked outside and Defeated. Them. All. One after another, And then went back to the party. Turn down for WHAT?! But this wasn't some amusing tavern brawl. It was a crime during a royal event. Louis was not happy; Honor duels were illegal They allowed individuals to take matters into their own hands rather than defer to the king's law. In fact, he'd steadily increased the penalty for them over the course of his reign. Unlike her previous crime against the church, This crime was against the king, the same king who extended her patronage and protection. Julie fled to Brussels. While waiting for things to calm down, she had an affair with a German prince, y'know Just to pass the time? and returned to Paris a year later to take a permanent position in the Opera. She tried to settle down, even reuniting with her husband. Yeah, remember him? Her troublemaking days were hardly behind her, but she wouldn't be burning down any more convents During those last years she sang for the royal court many times and in 1702, she reached the height of her career, performing an opera written specifically for her. But steady predictable life never agreed with Julie. After a few years of domestic bliss and a few fistfights, Julie eventually fell head over heels in love with la Marquise de Florensac When the Marquise died in 1705, Julie slipped into deep grief, Retired from opera, and joined a convent, for real this time She died there at the age of thirty-three. Julie's short and wild life reveals a lot about the world she lived in. While she was a force to be reckoned with, she also took advantage of shifting political and cultural norms in France, carving out a space where she could live as her authentic self. No one before or since was quite like Julie d'Aubigny. "
249,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,6WkjHyKHyX4,"April 30th, 1494, Cuba. It's the second voyage of the Genoese mariner Christopher Columbus. He's returned to the Caribbean to take gold and slaves. But also to build a colony, and on orders of Queen Isabella of Spain he's brought along one of the key tools of Spanish colonialism. They trot ashore, squealing in the surf. They are a fundamental element of Spanish settlement, a potent military asset, and a biological weapon without peer. Eight pigs come ashore on the Cuban beach. Their descendants will ravage the Americas for centuries. We're talking about pigs, baby! God, I love this show.

The Spanish invasion and the colonization of the Americas wouldn't have been possible, without a few non-human allies, and though horses are the animal most associated with Spanish colonialism there was another animal just as important, the domestic pig. Pigs traveled with the Spanish almost everywhere they settled. Pork was a staple of their diet, since it survived well in the rocky Spanish terrain, and since most expeditions provisioned themselves in the pig-heavy Canary Islands, it was a logical animal to bring. Pigs were almost the perfect animal to keep aboard ship. Yes, they were dirty, sure, but they were more compact than cows, and while cows sheep and goats needed grassy fields, pigs needed, whatever!? They were omnivorous, so they could live off of table scraps, agricultural byproducts, or even human waste, if that was all that was available. So not only did that make them easy to keep aboard ship, but they could adapt to almost any environment once they arrived. Plus, their short reproductive cycle and large litters meant they could multiply relatively quickly, turning even a few hogs into a self-sustaining population, and they were hardy. The shock of an ocean voyage rendered most farm animals sterile for a year after arrival, but pigs could just, well, keep making more pigs. In fact, the pigs were so hardy that they didn't even need humans to raise them. The Spanish regularly released breeding pairs on Caribbean islands, confident that when they returned months, or years later, there would be a large herd of wild pigs ready to feed a colony, resupply a ship, or keep any unfortunate castaways alive. They were essentially the perfect colonial animal, a living build-a-settlement set, with versatility beyond peer. When smoked or salted, pork lasted almost indefinitely, and pork products greased the wheels of Spanish society, and I mean that literally because during this period anything with wheels only worked if its axles were well lubricated with pork grease, and pork fat provided the key ingredient in products from soap, to candles, to lantern oil, and many types of medicine. Pig organs were the plastic containers of their day, both air and waterproof, used to make everything from balloons, to inflatable sports balls, to water skins, and paint containers. Hogs hair even made the best quality artist brushes in the Renaissance, and this New World would need artists to paint all of the cathedrals these conquistadors planned to build. So as the Spanish established settlements in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America, more and more pigs traveled with them, and the results were nothing less than catastrophic. 20 years after Columbus arrived in Cuba with his 8 pigs the governor of Cuba wrote to the Spanish crown, reporting that there were 30,000 hogs on the island. Now this may be an exaggeration, but reports from the Caribbean frequently mentioned the sheer number of the beasts, and locals had also discovered a love for pork, and therefore increasingly raised the creatures themselves, and then there were the escapees. See what also sets pigs apart is their intelligence. Smarter than even dogs, today's research shows that pigs can plan, think, and even, play computer games, that makes them talented escape artists, and within years of Spanish settlement hordes of pigs were living wild on the Caribbean islands, with no natural predators and perfectly suited to the native environment. They particularly thrived on native fruits which had evolved no defenses against large mammals, since there were no large mammals in their islands original ecosystems. Huh, fair point, Zoe. Well, Rob knows history like no one else and I read it like a champ if I do say so myself. Ecological systems are a bit out of our range of expertise. You know, I really wish we knew an ecology expert who could explain why pigs completely wrecked native ecosystems. [crumbling sound] [pig squeals] Ahhh, what in the day two-pig-in-the-city..!? TierZoo: Ask and ye shall receive, Matt. Matt: Hey TierZoo. I'm so happy you're here! Matt: But why did you have to bore a hole through my wall right there? Haha up top zinger! No? I'll, nope, okay, Matt: I'll just put that back. Tierzoo: Because it sounded like you wanted to know more about the specific attributes that made hogs OP throughout history. Matt: Oh, I do want that very much. But I also didn't really want to have to redraw that white wall. Matt: Sorry, Nick! TierZoo: in that case Once you're done with this video come check out my video over on my channel TierZoo: TierZoo where we'll discuss all the base stats, special abilities, and unique traits, that have given pigs a competitive edge across all of the Game of Life's different expansions, from the Anthropocene's wild boar to the Eocene's 'hell pig' Matt: Yeah! Wait? What is a 'hell pig'? [Rumbling steps] Matt: Huh... [Deep pig squeal] TierZoo: You'll have to come watch the video to find out. See you over there everyone. Let's roll, Digby. [Rumbling steps] Matt: Thanks TiersZoo. Oh man, it's always nice when friends stop by. Where was I? Oh, yeah Resistant to snake venom, a thick hide that shrugs off most attackers, and the ability to devastate native plants and wildlife, that's our friend the pig. Within decades wild pigs were destroying Caribbean ecosystems driving native plants and animals to the brink of extinction. This in turn had dire consequences for the native people, whose ways of life depended on those plants and animals. But the damage was not confined to the islands, in 1539, Conquistador Hernando de Soto landed in what's now Florida. Determined to set off west and explore this new continent. He brought with him: 13 pigs. The start, he hoped, of a new farming settlement. In fact, he was so protective of these animals that he refused to let his soldiers eat them, and instead they built rafts for the beasts whenever the expedition crossed the river. Three years later, when de Soto's men secretly dropped his corpse in the Mississippi River, which is a long and separate story involving claiming to be a sun god, those 13 pigs had turned into 700, and that's not counting those that soldiers ate, or that escaped, forming a population of feral hogs that are still to this day causing ecological damage in the United States. In fact in many places like in the American Southwest, conquistadors reported that populations of feral pigs actually arrived before they did. What that meant was that a biological invasion preceded the Spanish one. Groups of unfamiliar animals destroyed native environments, disrupting local wildlife and the societies that depended on them. More damaging still was the fact that this wave of unfamiliar animals also carried unfamiliar diseases. Pigs can catch and carry a number of diseases that can transfer to humans, most notably the flu and their bacteria and parasites contaminate any river lake they defecate in. The result was an epidemic. A century after De Soto stealthy funeral on the river, a French expedition entered the Mississippi Valley to find a population one-tenth the size of what De Soto described. The cities, the villages, all wiped out. Was that from pig-borne diseases? Maybe, but it's impossible to be sure. But the pigs use as a tool of conquest was no accident because they were also a military asset. A mobile food source that could be herded behind the troops pigs served an essential logistical role in the campaigns that toppled the largest empires of the Americas. Cortes brought thousands of pigs with him when he toppled the Aztec empire, and Francisco Pizarro, who ironically might have been a swine herd early in life, marched into the Andes with a great herd of hogs at his back. Determined to strip the Inca Empire of its treasure, which leads us nicely to the fact that next week we're going to start our five-part series on the rise and fall of the Inca Empire.

250,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,6a6kbU88wu0,"Have you ever tried to picture an ideal world? One without war, poverty, or crime? If so, you're not alone. Plato imagined an enlightened republic ruled by philosopher kings, many religions promise  bliss in the afterlife, and throughout history, various groups have tried to build paradise on Earth. Thomas More's 1516 book ""Utopia"" gave this concept a name, Greek for ""no place."" Though the name suggested impossibility, modern scientific and political progress raised hopes of these dreams finally becoming reality. But time and time again, they instead turned into nightmares of war, famine, and oppression. And as artists began to question utopian thinking, the genre of dystopia, the not good place, was born. One of the earliest dystopian works is Jonathan Swift's ""Gulliver's Travels."" Throughout his journey, Gulliver encounters fictional societies, some of which at first seem impressive, but turn out to be seriously flawed. On the flying island of Laputa, scientists and social planners pursue extravagant and useless schemes while neglecting the practical needs of the people below. And the Houyhnhnm who live in perfectly logical harmony have no tolerance for the imperfections of actual human beings. With his novel, Swift established a blueprint for dystopia, imagining a world where certain trends in contemporary society are taken to extremes, exposing their underlying flaws. And the next few centuries would provide plenty of material. Industrial technology that promised to free laborers imprisoned them in slums and factories, instead, while tycoons grew richer than kings. By the late 1800's, many feared where such conditions might lead. H. G. Wells's ""The Time Machine"" imagined upper classes and workers evolving into separate species, while Jack London's ""The Iron Heel"" portrayed a tyrannical oligarchy ruling over impoverished masses. The new century brought more exciting and terrifying changes. Medical advances made it possible to transcend biological limits while mass media allowed instant communication between leaders and the public. In Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World"", citizens are genetically engineered and conditioned to perform their social roles. While propaganda and drugs keep the society happy, it's clear some crucial  human element is lost. But the best known dystopias were not imaginary at all. As Europe suffered unprecedented industrial warfare, new political movements took power. Some promised to erase all social distinctions, while others sought to unite people around a mythical heritage. The results were real-world dystopias where life passed under the watchful eye of the State and death came with ruthless efficiency to any who didn't belong. Many writers of the time didn't just observe these horrors, but lived through them. In his novel ""We"", Soviet writer Yevgeny Zamyatin described a future where free will and individuality were eliminated. Banned in the U.S.S.R., the book inspired authors like George Orwell who fought on the front lines against both fascism and communism. While his novel ""Animal Farm"" directly mocked the Soviet regime, the classic ""1984"" was a broader critique of totalitarianism, media, and language. And in the U.S.A., Sinclair Lewis's ""It Can't Happen Here"" envisioned how easily democracy gave way to fascism. In the decades after World War II, writers wondered what new technologies like atomic energy,  artificial intelligence, and space travel meant for humanity's future. Contrasting with popular visions of shining progress, dystopian science fiction expanded to films, comics, and games. Robots turned against their creators while TV screens broadcast deadly mass entertainment. Workers toiled in space colonies above an Earth of depleted resources and overpopulated, crime-plagued cities. Yet politics was never far away. Works like ""Dr. Strangelove"" and ""Watchmen"" explored the real threat of nuclear war, while ""V for Vendetta"" and ""The Handmaid's Tale"" warned how easily our rights could disappear in a crisis. And today's dystopian fiction continues to reflect modern anxieties about inequality, climate change, government power, and global epidemics. So why bother with all this pessimism? Because at their heart, dystopias are cautionary tales, not about some particular government or technology, but the very idea that humanity can be molded into an ideal shape. Think back to the perfect world you imagined. Did you also imagine what it would take to achieve? How would you make people cooperate? And how would you make sure it lasted? Now take another look. Does that world still seem perfect? "
251,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,6ev4KHAToWM,"When the Hoover Dam was  completed in 1936, it created a huge source of hydroelectric power and zapped a sleepy desert town to life:  Las Vegas, Nevada. With the power supply from the dam, Las Vegas soon exploded with vibrant displays. The source of these dazzling lights was electrified neon gas. There are two tricky obstacles  to making lighted signs out of this naturally clear,  odorless gas: capturing it and making it glow. French inventor Georges Claude came up  with techniques to do both. In 1902, he developed a way of liquefying and  separating specific gases from the air, producing neon on an industrial  scale for the first time. By 1910, he had come up with a way  to trap the gas in a glass tube with a special electrode at either end,  and neon lighting was born. In workshops like Claude's, artisans known as tube-benders made neon signs by hand. The tube-benders heated small sections of a long, hollow glass tube and quickly bent them into shape. After the glass cooled, they attached  electrodes to each end and removed the air with a vacuum pump. Then, they passed a high voltage current through the tube to remove any impurities on the  inside of the glass. Finally, they pumped the neon gas in  and sealed off the electrodes. When a neon sign is turned on, the electric current causes some of the neon atoms' electrons to accelerate and break free of their orbits, leaving behind positively charged ions. As these free electrons rush from one electrode to the other, they collide with more neon atoms, causing them to ionize as well. When these excited electrons fall back to their normal energy levels, their excess energy is carried away by photons, or particles of light. All this happens in an instant, and the glow from the photons is what  we see when we switch on a neon sign. Though it's common to call any  gas-filled sign a ""neon"" sign, there are actually 5 different  gases used in production. Each gas emits photons of a different  wavelength when electrified, which correspond to different  colors of light. Neon gives off an orange-red glow, argon  glows a pale lavender, helium a dusty pink, krypton a silver- white, and xenon a light purple. These 5 gases can be combined  with color-coated tubing to create an electrified rainbow of  text and images. Business owners soon realized how  effective these colorful beacons were for attracting customers. And unlike a light bulb, a neon sign has no incandescent filaments to burn out, and can shine continuously for 40 years before the gas depletes. By the 1930s, neon signs were lighting up storefronts all over the world. Because of the glass tubes'  fragile nature, it usually wasn't feasible to ship  them over long distances. Instead, most neon signs were created by  local neon shops and then installed nearby. Signs with humor, personality, and intricate designs proliferated, no two exactly alike. But by the end of World War II, plastics had become widely available and inexpensive, and plastic signs supplanted neon as messengers of modernity. Many towns removed neon signs they viewed as old-fashioned. Today, neon sign production is only a fraction of what it was at its peak, but the craft of tube bending lives on relatively unchanged. New creations hand-crafted  by local artisans join survivors from the heyday of neon, hiding in plain sight in city streets around the world. "
252,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,6tw_JVz_IEc,"From the smallest single-celled organism to the largest creatures on earth, every living thing is defined  by its genes. The DNA contained in our genes acts like an instruction manual for our cells. Four building blocks called bases are  strung together in precise sequences, which tell the cell how to behave and form the basis for our every trait. But with recent advancements  in gene editing tools, scientists can change an organism’s fundamental features in record time. They can engineer drought-resistant crops and create apples that don’t brown. They might even prevent the spread  of infectious outbreaks and develop cures for genetic diseases. CRISPR is the fastest, easiest, and cheapest of the gene editing tools responsible for this new wave of science. But where did this medical  marvel come from? How does it work? And what can it do? Surprisingly, CRISPR is actually a  natural process that’s long functioned as a  bacterial immune system. Originally found defending single-celled  bacteria and archaea against invading viruses, naturally occurring CRISPR uses  two main components. The first are short snippets of  repetitive DNA sequences called “clustered regularly interspaced  short palindromic repeats,” or simply, CRISPRs. The second are Cas, or “CRISPR-associated” proteins which chop up DNA like molecular scissors. When a virus invades a bacterium, Cas proteins cut out a segment  of the viral DNA to stitch into the bacterium’s CRISPR region, capturing a chemical snapshot  of the infection. Those viral codes are then copied  into short pieces of RNA. This molecule plays many roles  in our cells, but in the case of CRISPR, RNA binds to a special protein  called Cas9. The resulting complexes act like scouts, latching onto free-floating genetic material and searching for a match to the virus. If the virus invades again, the scout complex recognizes it immediately, and Cas9 swiftly destroys the viral DNA. Lots of bacteria have this type of defense mechanism. But in 2012, scientists figured out  how to hijack CRISPR to target not just viral DNA, but any DNA in almost any organism. With the right tools, this viral immune system becomes a precise gene-editing tool, which can alter DNA and  change specific genes almost as easily as fixing a typo. Here’s how it works in the lab: scientists design a “guide” RNA  to match the gene they want to edit, and attach it to Cas9. Like the viral RNA in the  CRISPR immune system, the guide RNA directs Cas9  to the target gene, and the protein’s molecular scissors  snip the DNA. This is the key to CRISPR’s power: just by injecting Cas9 bound to a short piece of custom guide RNA scientists can edit practically any gene in the genome. Once the DNA is cut, the cell will try to repair it. Typically, proteins called nucleases trim the broken ends and join them back together. But this type of repair process, called nonhomologous end joining, is prone to mistakes and can lead to extra or missing bases. The resulting gene is often unusable and turned off. However, if scientists add a separate  sequence of template DNA to their CRISPR cocktail, cellular proteins can perform a different DNA repair process, called homology directed repair. This template DNA is used as a blueprint  to guide the rebuilding process, repairing a defective gene or even inserting a completely new one. The ability to fix DNA errors means that CRISPR could potentially create new treatments for diseases linked to specific genetic errors, like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anemia. And since it’s not limited to humans, the applications are almost endless. CRISPR could create plants that yield larger fruit, mosquitoes that can’t transmit malaria, or even reprogram drug-resistant  cancer cells. It’s also a powerful tool for studying the genome, allowing scientists to watch what happens when genes are turned off or changed within an organism. CRISPR isn’t perfect yet. It doesn’t always make  just the intended changes, and since it’s difficult to predict the long-term implications of a CRISPR edit, this technology raises big ethical questions. It’s up to us to decide the  best course forward as CRISPR leaves single-celled  organisms behind and heads into labs, farms, hospitals, and organisms around the world. "
253,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,79RApCgwZFw,"Before Europeans arrived, on what they would name 'North American soil' Five Nations came together and formed a confederacy. They were guided by the will of the people and they created a constitution with 117 articles that guaranteed the rights of the people, and the responsibilities of their leaders. That constitution, the Great Law of Peace, still guides those people to this day. So who are they? Well, those Europeans we mentioned would call them Iroquois, but that's not really their name. They are the Haudenosaunee: ""People of the Longhouse"" We don't know exactly when they formed their confederacy only that it certainly came before the arrival of Europeans, perhaps by as much as a millennium. We also know the name of one of its founders: Hiawatha. [Intro music] When Big Huge Games told us that they planned to add Hiawatha as a Great Leader in their game, DomiNations, we got pretty excited! The confederacy he formed is an incredible piece of history of governance, one that has survived for centuries and played an acknowledged role in shaping the U.S. constitution. And when we asked Big Huge Games if they would be interested in sponsoring 2 episodes about Hiawatha's role forming the Haudenosauneeian confederacy they got pretty excited! So here we go! But first, a disclaimer: Much of the evidence of the Haudenosaunee confederacy's foundation has been handed down through the oral tradition. And where history privileges the written word, a culture that keeps its history through sacred stories will often be left out of the prevailing narrative. Or worse, told that they have no history at all. The Haudenosaunee very much have a history. And it's a living history, characterized by a variety of perspective and expression. Our goal here isn't to mandate one principal story that must be believed above all others but to relate one story of Hiawatha as a lens to learn about the living, real and vital Haudenosaunee confederacy. Our story begins in Onondaga territory, in a time when people who had once been brothers warred with each other. A chief named Tadodaho led the Onondaga into battle after battle. He was ferocious, to the point of viciousness. And although he won many battles, his victories never brought peace and his lust for violence only grew stronger. The lesser chiefs of his tribe lived in fear of him and Tadodaho treated them like scum whose only purpose was to praise and obey him. But one of them did not. His name was Hiawatha. Hiawatha was grieving. His wife had been taken from him by raiders long ago. Two of his daughters had died of illness that couldn't be cured. And then his third daughter, whom he cherished and tried to protect, died in a tragic accident. Hiawatha found himself looking back on a lifetime of war with regret. This sorrow he felt must surely be shared by everybody who had lost a child or a loved one. War seemed to him like the worst cause of this grief since unlike illness or misfortune, war could be avoided. At least, he believed it could be. He called a council of all the Onondaga chiefs, including Tadodaho, to propose a peace. According to stories he'd heard, their brother tribe, the Mohawk, had embraced a peaceful way of life and were no longer waging war on anyone. Hiawatha said, ""if we unite with them, we can protect each other."" ""We'll have no more need of war."" Tadodaho hated that idea. War was his identity; it was the foundation of his power. Everyone who looked up to him did so because they feared his strength. He told Hiawatha that if he liked this Mohawk peace so much, maybe he should go live with them. And the remaining chiefs, cowed by Tadodaho, didn't disagree. So, Hiawatha left. He traveled to the current home of the Mohawks and sought the man he'd heard stories about. The man who had convinced them to give up their warring ways and embrace peace. His grandmother had given him a different name, but now everybody called him: the Peacemaker. Hiawatha waited patiently outside the walls of the Mohawk village where the Peacemaker lived, until the Peacemaker came to him. When they met, Hiawatha gave him a string of shining purple and white beads called wampum. The white ones represented peace, he said, and the dark ones represented war. So he had created a string with white beads on either side of the dark beads to show his desire for peace to overcome war. The Peacemaker had never before seen wampum used to convey a message and he liked this stranger immediately. The Peacemaker welcomed Hiawatha into his longhouse. When he heard what Hiawatha had proposed among the Onondaga, his face lit up. But as they talked, it became clear that he didn't want just the Onondaga and the Mohawk to be allies. He believed all people could live together in peace as the Creator intended. Of course, he and Hiawatha agreed that the easiest place to start would be with the Five Nations who already shared similar languages. The Onondaga, the Mohawk, the Oneida, the Cayuga and the Seneca. Going back to Tadodaho would be pointless; Hiawatha knew he would never listen because he never listened to anything but power. They needed allies. They would need to recruit the other nations first. But how? The other nations didn't know him - they wouldn't listen to him. They needed somebody who could reach out to the chiefs of every nation. They needed someone whom the warriors wouldn't attack on sight. They needed Jigonsaseh. She had become something of a legend among the warriors. Her longhouse stood at a crossroads and many warriors sought refuge with her on their marches. She was a Seneca woman but she allowed anyone to stay in her longhouse as long as they agreed to keep her peace. Often, when warriors of different nations came to her on the same day she would feed them dinner from the same soup bowl. Tradition dictated that anybody who shared food became kin and they were forbidden to fight each other. Thus, in her own way, Jigonsaseh had been forging small alliances across the Five Nations for years. They visited Jigonsaseh at her longhouse and the Peacemaker explained that he wanted to build one just like it. One that brought together all Five Nations under one great law of peace. Women like her would be the backbone of this new peace because women were keepers of the Earth and leaders of the clans. Clan mothers would be empowered to choose the chiefs, to remove them if they failed in their responsibilities, to call councils and to review new laws. He asked Jigonsaseh to be his messenger to the women's councils in all the nations and to bring his message of righteousness, health and power. And she replied, ""That is indeed a good message."" ""I take hold of it; I embrace it."" Together, she and Hiawatha journeyed to the nearby tribe of the Oneida as envoys of the Peacemaker's message. The Oneida were the little brothers of the Mohawk so they were more inclined than anyone else to accept the peace which the Mohawk now embraced. Those who knew Jigonsaseh trusted her, and welcomed her and Hiawatha among them as speakers who relayed the Peacemaker's message. Then the great debate began. The Oneida had suffered plenty from the war but could they really afford to put aside their weapons and trust peace to protect them? The elders argued that peace had been the way of their people since the land had been given to them. That was the past though, and now they had many warriors who lived to fight, and enemies who wanted to destroy them. Arguments were levied on both sides and the discussion raged for a full year. But the Peacemaker was insistent. War was an aberration, a betrayal of the wishes of the Creator and of the interests of the people. If they wanted to be strong - truly strong - they would have to lead the way with their own choices. They MUST choose peace. They owed it to all of the casualties of war whose bones lay in the ground whose futures had been cut short. They owed it to themselves to make a new future. They could live without fear if they learned to put hatred aside and unite with a new strength of purpose. Once they embraced peace, others would follow and they would all gather strength like a ball in the snow. His passion impressed the Oneida and his arguments won them over. Finally, they agreed. The first treaty of the Great Law of Peace had been formed. Inspired by their success, Hiawatha wanted to return to the Onondaga with this message and the news that two tribes had now embraced it. Tadodaho enjoyed his power, but surely he couldn't stand against two tribes united in peace. The Peacemaker was willing but Jigonsaseh had her doubts. She had heard terrible stories about Tadodaho: his cruelty in war and his violence toward the women of his own house ""He has an evil heart,"" she said. ""Men like him could never be brought to peace."" The Peacemaker replied: ""It is exactly men like him that I must speak to."" So together, they journeyed back to the Onondaga where Hiawatha called together a council. Tadohado sat across from the Peacemaker and did not listen. Once again, he told them that he had no interest in peace and he wouldn't tolerate any further negotiations. If the Mohawk and the Oneida wanted to embrace this Great Law of Peace, fine for them. That just meant they would leave him alone so he had fewer enemies to defeat and he had every intention of continuing to make war on his enemies. Hiawatha left this council in low spirits but the Peacemaker's hopes remained bright. He told Hiawatha to keep thinking about how to bring Tadodaho around to the idea of peace. And in the meantime, the three of them would set out for the lands of the next tribe on their list: the Cayuga. Just as the Oneida were the little brothers of the Mohawk, the Cayuga were the little brothers of the Onondaga. They had suffered greatly from Tadodaho who treated them poorly but demanded that they fight in his wars. They could never refuse for fear that Tadodaho would turn his much larger force against them. To them, an alliance with the Mohawk and the Oneida sounded like the perfect way forward. The chiefs readily agreed and joined the Great Law of Peace. Now they had taken an ally from under Tadodaho's control. They had diminished him. Perhaps they could remove him from power entirely but that wasn't what the Peacemaker wanted. He needed the people to unite, to choose peace, and to come together like a family. In a family, no one was beyond saving. Luckily, Hiawatha now had a plan. Join us next week as the Peacemaker and his speakers return to confront Tadodaho and bring the last of the Five Nations together, under the Great Law of Peace.

254,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,7Lg4vjRY4Ts,"In the summer of 1963, a high school teacher changed the way the world looked at ""The Wizard of Oz."" His name was Henry Littlefield, and he was teaching  an American history class. He'd made it to the late 19th century, a time called The Gilded Age, but he was struggling to keep his class interested in the complex social and economic issues of the time. Then one night, while he was reading ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" to his daughters, he had an idea. In the 1890s, farmers wanted to add silver to the gold standard to put more money in circulation and make it easier for farmers to borrow. In the book, Dorothy walked to the Emerald City on the Yellow Brick Road in her silver shoes. The movie's ruby red slippers  started out as silver. Silver and gold on the road to prosperity. L. Frank Baum had published the book in 1900 at the height of The Gilded Age, and the analogy didn't seem out of the question. No one else had seen these connections, but that didn't deter Littlefield. He taught his class about The Gilded Age using the book, and soon he and his students were finding more connections. For instance, in the late 1890s, the U.S. had recently recovered from the Civil War and integrated vast new territories, bringing an era of prosperity for some. But while industry and finance in the North and East prospered, farmers across the South and Midwest struggled. This led to the Populist movement, uniting farmers and workers against urban elites. By 1896, the movement had grown into the People's Party, and its support of Democrat Williams Jennings Bryan put him in reach of the presidency. Meanwhile in Oz, claimed Littlefield, Dorothy is a typical American girl whose hard life in Kansas is literally turned upside down by powerful forces outside her control. The munchkins are the common people oppressed by the Witch of the East, banks and monopolies. The Scarecrow is the farmer, considered naive but actually quite resourceful, the Tin Woodman is the industrial worker dehumanized by factory labor, and the Cowardly Lion  is William Jennings Bryan who could be an influential figure if only he were brave enough to adopt the Populist's radical program. Together, they travel along a golden yellow road towards a grand city whose ruler's power turns out to be built on illusions. Littlefield published some of these observations in an essay. His claim that this fantasy was actually a subversive critique of American capitalism appealed to many people in 1960s. Other scholars took up the theme, and the proposed analogies and connections multiplied. They suggested that Dorothy's dog Toto represented the teetotalers of the prohibition party. Oz was clearly the abbreviation for ounces, an important unit in the silver debate. The list goes on. By the 1980s, this understanding of the book was accepted so widely that several American history textbooks mentioned it in discussions of late 19th century politics. But is the theory right? L. Frank Baum's introduction claims the book is just an innocent children's story. Could he have been deliberately throwing people off the trail? And is it fair to second guess him so many decades later? There's no definitive answer, which is part of why authorial intent is a complex, tangled, fun question to unravel. And some recent scholars have interpreted ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" in the opposite way as Littlefield. They claim it's a celebration of the  new urban consumer culture. Historian William Leach argued that the dazzling Emerald City of Oz was meant to acclimate people to the shiny, new America. In the end, all we know for sure is that Baum, inspired by European folk legends, had set out to create one for American children. And whether or not he intended any hidden meanings, its continuing relevance suggests he succeeded in creating a fairytale America can call its own. "
255,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,7bUVjJWA6Vw,"What does the French Revolution have to do with the time NASA accidentally crashed a $200 million orbiter into the surface of Mars? Actually, everything. That crash happened due to an error in converting between two measurement systems, U.S. customary units and their S.I, or metric, equivalence. So what's the connection to the French Revolution? Let's explain. For the majority of recorded human history, units like the weight of a grain or the length of a hand weren't exact and varied from place to place. And different regions didn't just use varying measurements. They had completely different  number systems as well. By the late Middle Ages, the Hindu-Arabic decimal system mostly replaced Roman numerals and fractions in Europe, but efforts by scholars like John Wilkins to promote standard decimal-based measures were less successful. With a quarter million different units in France alone, any widespread change would require massive disruption. And in 1789, that disruption came. The leaders of the French Revolution didn't just overthrow the monarchy. They sought to completely  transform society according to the rational principles of the Enlightenment. When the new government took power, the Academy of Sciences convened to reform the system of measurements. Old standards based on arbitrary authority or local traditions were replaced with mathematical and natural relationships. For example, the meter, from the Greek word for measure, was defined as 1/10,000,000 between the Equator and North Pole. And the new metric system was, in the words of the Marquis de Condorcet, ""For all people, for all time."" Standardizing measurements had political advantages for the Revolutionaries as well. Nobles could no longer manipulate local units to extract more rent from commoners, while the government could collect taxes more efficiently. And switching to a new Republican Calendar with ten-day weeks reduced church power  by eliminating Sundays. Adoption of this new system wasn't easy. In fact, it was a bit of a mess. At first, people used new units alongside old ones, and the Republican Calendar was eventually abandoned. When Napoléon Bonaparte took power, he allowed small businesses  to use traditional measurements redefined in metric terms. But the metric system remained standard for formal use, and it spread across the continent, along with France's borders. While Napoléon's empire  lasted eight years, its legacy endured far longer. Some European countries reverted to old measurements upon independence. Others realized the value  of standardization in an age of international trade. After Portugal and the Netherlands switched to metric voluntarily, other nations followed, with colonial empires spreading the system around the world. As France's main rival, Britain had resisted revolutionary ideas and retained its traditional units. But over the next two centuries, the British Empire slowly transitioned, first approving the metric system as an optional alternative before gradually making it offical. However, this switch came too late for thirteen former colonies that had already gained independence. The United States of America stuck with the English units of its colonial past and today remains one  of only three countries which haven't fully embraced the metric system. Despite constant initiatives  for metrication, many Americans consider units like feet and pounds more intuitive. And ironically, some regard the once revolutionary metric system as a symbol of global conformity. Nevertheless, the metric system is almost universally used in science and medicine, and it continues to evolve according to its original principles. For a long time, standard units were actually defined by carefully maintained physical prototypes. But thanks to improving technology and precision, these objects with limited access and unreliable longevity are now being replaced with standards based on universal constants, like the speed of light. Consistent measurements are such an integral part of our daily lives that it's hard to appreciate what a major accomplishment for humanity they've been. And just as it arose from a political revolution, the metric system remains crucial for the scientific revolutions to come. "
256,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,7k6n46xBTxs,"In a Moment of Vision... It's 1762. John Montagu is the 4th Earl of Sandwich, a small parish in  the southwest of England. Despite his keen administrative skills, Montagu is a corrupt politician, an adulterous husband, and an incessant, degenerate gambler. Often, while Montagu is in the midst of a particularly high-stakes game, he will insist on being served his meals at the table. In a moment of vision, though likely inspired by his travels, the Earl orders his meat and cheese be brought to him stacked between two slices of bread so that he may eat with one hand while continuing to gamble with the other. In one notorious episode, Montagu spends a full day and night gambling. It is during the infamous 24 hours at the gaming table that Montagu's characteristic handheld concession is dubbed ""the sandwich."" According to one estimate, Americans now consume more than 300 million sandwiches every day. "
257,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,7m8QlSPP7t0,"For the microscopic lab worm, C. elegans life equates to just a few short weeks on Earth. Compare that with the tortoise, which can age to more than 100 years. Mice and rats reach the end of their lives after just four years, while for the bowhead whale, Earth's longest-lived mammal, death can come after 200. Like most living things, the vast majority of animals gradually degenerate after reaching sexual maturity in the process known as aging. But what does it really mean to age? The drivers behind this process are varied and complicated, but aging is ultimately  caused by cell death and dysfunction. When we're young,  we constantly regenerate cells in order to replace dead and dying ones. But as we age, this process slows down. In addition, older cells don't perform their functions as well as young ones. That makes our bodies go into a decline, which eventually results in disease and death. But if that's consistently true, why the huge variance in aging patterns and lifespan within the animal kingdom? The answer lies in several factors, including environment and body size. These can place powerful evolutionary pressures on animals to adapt, which in turn makes the aging process different across species. Consider the cold depths of the Atlantic and Arctic Seas, where Greenland sharks can live to over 400 years, and the Arctic clam known as the quahog can live up to 500. Perhaps the most impressive of these ocean-dwelling ancients is the Antarctic glass sponge, which can survive over 10,000 years in frigid waters. In cold environments like these, heartbeats and metabolic rates slow down. Researchers theorize that this also causes a slowing of the aging process. In this way, the environment shapes longevity. When it comes to size,  it's often, but not always, the case that larger species have a longer lifespan than smaller ones. For instance, an elephant or whale will live much longer than a mouse, rat, or vole, which in turn have years on flies and worms. Some small animals, like worms and flies, are also limited by the mechanics of their cell division. They're mostly made up of cells that can't divide and be replaced when damaged, so their bodies expire more quickly. And size is a powerful evolutionary driver in animals. Smaller creatures are more prone to predators. A mouse, for instance, can hardly expect to survive more than a year in the wild. So, it has evolved to grow and reproduce more rapidly, like an evolutionary defense mechanism against its shorter lifespan. Larger animals, by contrast, are better at fending off predators, and so they have the luxury of time to grow to large sizes and reproduce multiple times during their lives. Exceptions to the size rule include bats, birds, moles, and turtles, but in each case, these animals have other adaptations that allow them to escape predators. But there are still cases where animals with similar defining features, like size and habitat, age at completely different rates. In these cases, genetic differences, like how each organism's cells respond to threats, often account for the discrepancies in longevity. So it's the combination of all these factors playing out to differing degrees in different animals that explains the variability we see in the animal kingdom. So what about us? Humans currently have  an average life expectancy of 71 years, meaning that we're not even close to being the longest living inhabitants on Earth. But we are very good at increasing our life expectancy. In the early 1900s, humans only lived an average of 50 years. Since then, we've learned to adapt by managing many of the factors that cause deaths, like environmental exposure and nutrition. This, and other increases  in life expectancy make us possibly the only species on Earth to take control over our natural fate. "
258,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,7snnRaC4t5c,"When French mathematician Laurent Schwartz was in high school, he started to worry that he wasn't smart enough to solve math problems. Maybe you know a similar feeling. You sit down to take a math test, and you feel your heart beat faster and your palms start to sweat. You get butterflies in your stomach, and you can't concentrate. This phenomenon is called math anxiety, and if it happens to you, you're not alone. Researchers think about 20% of the population suffers from it. Some psychologists even consider it a diagnosable condition. But having mathematical anxiety doesn't necessarily mean you're bad at math - not even close. Laurent Schwartz went on to win the Fields Medal, the highest award in mathematics. People might think that they're anxious about math because they're bad at it, but it's often the other way around. They're doing poorly in math because they're anxious about it. Some psychologists think that's because math anxiety decreases a cognitive resource called working memory. That's the short-term memory system that helps you organize the information  you need to complete a task. Worrying about being able to solve math problems, or not doing well on a test, eats up working memory, leaving less of it available to tackle the math itself. People can suddenly struggle with even basic math skills, like arithmetic, that they've otherwise mastered. Academic anxiety certainly isn't limited to math, but it does seem to happen much more frequently, and cause more harm in that subject. So why would that be? Researchers aren't yet sure, but some studies suggest that the way children are exposed to math by their parents and teachers play a large part. If parents talk about math like something challenging and unfamiliar, children can internalize that. Teachers with math anxiety are also likely to spread it to their students. Pressure to solve problems quickly dials up stress even more. And in some cultures, being good at math is a sign of being smart in general. When the stakes are that high, it's not surprising  that students are anxious. Even Maryam Mirzakhani,  an influential mathematician who was the first woman to win the Fields Medal, felt unconfident and lost interest in mathematics because her math teacher in middle school didn't think she was talented. So if you experience mathematical anxiety, what can you do? Relaxation techniques,  like short breathing exercises, have improved test performance in students with math anxiety. Writing down your worries can also help. This strategy may give you a chance to reevaluate a stressful experience, freeing up working memory. And if you have the chance, physical activity, like a brisk walk, deepens breathing and helps relieve muscle tension, preventing anxiety from building. You can also use your knowledge about the brain to change your mindset. The brain is flexible, and the areas involved in math skills  can always grow and develop. This is a psychological principle called the growth mindset. Thinking of yourself as someone who can grow and improve can actually help you grow and improve. If you're a teacher or parent of young children, try being playful with math and focusing on the creative aspects. That can build the numerical skills that help students approach math  with confidence later on. Importantly, you should give children the time and space to work through their answers. And if you're an administrator, make sure your teachers  have the positive attitudes and mathematical confidence necessary to inspire confidence in all of their students. Also, don't let anyone spread the myth that boys are innately  better than girls at math. That is completely false. If you experience math anxiety, it may not help to just know that math anxiety exists. Or perhaps it's reassuring to put a name to the problem. Regardless, if you take a look around yourself, the odds are good that you'll see someone  experiencing the same thing as you. Just remember that the anxiety is not a reflection of your ability, but it is something you can conquer  with time and awareness. "
259,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,8HegwRtbDSU,"Spindly trees, rusted gates, crumbling stone, a solitary mourner— these things come to mind  when we think of cemeteries. But not so long ago, many burial grounds were lively places, with blooming gardens and crowds of people strolling among the headstones. How did our cemeteries  become what they are today? Some have been around for centuries, like the world’s largest, Wadi al-Salaam, where more than five million  people are buried. But most of the places we’d recognize  as cemeteries are much younger. In fact, for much of human history, we didn’t bury our dead at all. Our ancient ancestors had many other ways  of parting with the dead loved ones. Some were left in caves, others in trees or on mountaintops. Still others were sunk in lakes, put out to sea, ritually cannibalized, or cremated. All of these practices, though some may seem strange today, were ways of venerating the dead. By contrast, the first known burials about 120,000 years ago were likely reserved for transgressors, excluding them from the usual rites intended to honor the dead. But the first burials revealed some advantages over other practices: they protected bodies from scavengers  and the elements, while shielding loved ones from the  sight of decay. These benefits may have shifted  ancient people’s thinking toward graves designed to honor the dead, and burial became more common. Sometimes, these graves contained  practical or ritual objects, suggesting belief in an afterlife Communal burials first appeared in North Africa and West Asia around 10 to 15,000 years ago, around the same time as the first  permanent settlements in these areas. These burial grounds created permanent  places to commemorate the dead. The nomadic Scythians littered the steppes with grave mounds known as kurgans. The Etruscans built expansive necropoles, their grid-patterned streets lined with tombs. In Rome, subterranean catacombs housed both cremation urns and intact remains. The word cemetery, or “sleeping chamber,” was first used by ancient Greeks, who built tombs in graveyards at the edges of their cities. In medieval European cities, Christian churchyards provided  rare, open spaces that accommodated the dead, but also hosted markets, fairs,  and other events. Farmers even grazed cattle in them, believing graveyard grass made for sweeter milk. As cities grew during the industrial  revolution, large suburban cemeteries replaced  smaller urban churchyards. Cemeteries like the 110-acre  Père-Lachaise in Paris or the 72-acre Mt. Auburn in Cambridge, Massachusetts were lushly landscaped gardens filled with sculpted stones and ornate tombs. Once a luxury reserved for the rich  and powerful, individually marked graves became available to the middle  and working classes. People visited cemeteries for funerals, but also for anniversaries, holidays, or simply an afternoon outdoors. By the late 19th century, as more public parks and botanical gardens appeared, cemeteries began to lose visitors. Today, many old cemeteries are  lonely places. Some are luring visitors back with tours, concerts, and other attractions. But even as we revive old cemeteries, we’re rethinking the future of burial. Cities like London, New York, and  Hong Kong are running out of burial space. Even in places where space isn’t so tight, cemeteries permanently occupy land that can’t be otherwise cultivated  or developed. Traditional burial consumes materials like metal, stone, and concrete, and can pollute soil and groundwater with toxic chemicals. With increasing awareness of the  environmental costs, people are seeking alternatives. Many are turning to cremation and related practices. Along with these more conventional  practices, people can now have their remains  shot into space, used to fertilize a tree, or made into jewelry, fireworks, and even tattoo ink. In the future, options like these may  replace burial completely. Cemeteries may be our most familiar  monuments to the departed, but they’re just one step in our ever-evolving process of remembering and honoring the dead. "
260,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,8NS4CbBJQ84,"Deep inside Yale University's Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library lies the only copy of a 240-page tome. Recently carbon dated to around 1420, its vellum pages features  looping handwriting and hand-drawn images seemingly stolen from a dream. Real and imaginary plants, floating castles, bathing women, astrology diagrams, zodiac rings, and suns and moons with faces accompany the text. This 24x16 centimeter book is called the Voynich manuscript, and its one of history's biggest unsolved mysteries. The reason why? No one can figure out what it says. The name comes from Wilfrid Voynich, a Polish bookseller who came across the document at a Jesuit college in Italy in 1912. He was puzzled. Who wrote it? Where was it made? What do these bizarre words and vibrant drawings represent? What secrets do its pages contain? He purchased the manuscript from the cash-strapped priest at the college, and eventually brought it to the U.S., where experts have continued to puzzle over it for more than a century. Cryptologists say the writing has all the characteristics of a real language, just one that no one's ever seen before. What makes it seem real is that in actual languages, letters and groups of letters appear with consistent frequencies, and the language in the Voynich manuscript has patterns you wouldn't find from a random letter generator. Other than that, we know little more than what we can see. The letters are varied  in style and height. Some are borrowed from other scripts, but many are unique. The taller letters have been named gallows characters. The manuscript is highly decorated throughout with scroll-like embellishments. It appears to be written by two or more hands, with the painting done by yet another party. Over the years, three main theories about the manuscript's text have emerged. The first is that it's written in cypher, a secret code deliberately designed to hide secret meaning. The second is that the document is a hoax written in gibberish to make money off a gullible buyer. Some speculate the author was a medieval con man. Others, that it was Voynich himself. The third theory is that the manuscript is written in an actual language, but in an unknown script. Perhaps medieval scholars were attempting to create an alphabet for a language that was spoken but not yet written. In that case, the Voynich manuscript might be like the rongorongo script invented on Easter Island, now unreadable after the culture that made it collapsed. Though no one can read  the Voynich manuscript, that hasn't stopped people from guessing what it might say. Those who believe the manuscript was an attempt to create a new form of written language speculate that it might be an encyclopedia containing the knowledge  of the culture that produced it. Others believe it was written by  the 13th century philosopher Roger Bacon, who attempted to understand  the universal laws of grammar, or in the 16th century by the Elizabethan mystic John Dee, who practiced alchemy and divination. More fringe theories that the book was written by a coven of Italian witches, or even by Martians. After 100 years of frustration, scientists have recently shed a little light on the mystery. The first breakthrough  was the carbon dating. Also, contemporary historians have traced the provenance of the manuscript back through Rome and Prague to as early as 1612, when it was perhaps passed from Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II to his physician, Jacobus Sinapius. In addition to these  historical breakthroughs, linguistic researchers recently proposed the provisional identification of a few of the manuscript's words. Could the letters beside these seven stars spell Tauran, a name for Taurus, a constellation that includes the seven stars called the Pleiades? Could this word be Centaurun for the Centaurea plant in the picture? Perhaps, but progress is slow. If we can crack its code, what might we find? The dream journal of a 15th-century illustrator? A bunch of nonsense? Or the lost knowledge of a forgotten culture? What do you think it is? "
261,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,8OFg-lFmGJg,"Empires fall, civilizations burn, but somewhere out on the periphery, the light of science is still lit. (theme music) It's 1941, most of the world is at war, Asimov is working at the Philadelphia dock yards. He hasn't had much time to work on his stories, but he has been reading. In fact, he's been reading one of the most seminal works of modern history, Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. He has a meeting with Campbell today. He knows Campbell is going to want a story idea, and he's got nothing. Then, as he's walking to the astounding stories office, it hits him. Why don't we just do Decline and Fall IN SPACE? But he wanted to do it a little different. He wanted to explore how to lessen the impact of the fall. He wanted to discuss what might of happened if there had been a conscious effort to preserve knowledge in the last days of the empire, before the empire faded away. So, he began to write the Encyclopedists, a story about a world on the far edge of the imperium whose only task is to collate all human knowledge so the post-empire dark age might not be so dark. But in doing so, in rapid succession, he gave us some of the most important and most frequently borrowed ideas in science fiction. First is the space empire itself. No one had really built a fully-realized feudal empire in space before. Why would they? In many ways, the concept makes no sense. In the real world, the more complex human civilizations became, the more we found that rule by a single individual, was simply too inefficient to sustain. But who cares about the real world when the idea is so enticing? What if we took all those medieval romances, and those legends of the last day of Rome, but gave them technology beyond our wildest dreams? What happens when the medieval understanding with its emphasis on hierarchy and its etiquette, is tasked with managing whole worlds, rather than simple rural estates? This idea of space empire, combines the most romantic notions from the past with some of the most exciting possibilities in science fiction, and it's a concept sci-fi will draw upon time and time again. But that wasn't Asimov's only innovation, he also came up with Psycho history. This idea that, with an advanced enough understanding of mathematics, psychology, and sociology, the broad strokes of the future could be predicted; which becomes the impetus for the Foundation. But this psycho history effectively becomes a form of pre-science, introducing the question of fate and free will into science fiction in a, truly, science fictiony way. Because where other forms of literature have debated whether all of our actions are pre-ordained or if we have choice, only science fiction gets to play around with the consequences of knowing for sure. And while the foundation series simply seems to take the idea of pre-ordained actions as things which are necessary and good, later books, like Dune, will address the question of whether actually knowing the future might be a curse in a way we haven't seen since the midst of the Greeks. But for a galactic empire to form, and for science as advanced as psycho history to be established, he needed to set his novel not just in the future, but in far, far future, 50,000 years from today. And while other science fiction had been set in the far future, Asimov was the first to try to make it real. Rather than ""50 THOUSAND YEARS IN THE FUTURE"" acting as a hand wave for everything being different than it is today, Asimov attempted to give his future some sense of history. This really cemented an idea that hadn't been too prevalent in sci-fi up to this point. The idea that world building wasn't just about interesting aliens and strange landscapes, but about giving the reader at least a little bit of a sense of how we got there. How the world they knew, could possibly become the fantastic place these sprawling futures sometimes described. But he uses this history to play a trick on his audience. He sets them up to believe that his story is going to be about a group of encyclopedists on a planet dedicated to preserving human knowledge. That their goal is to catalog and store all of humanity's ideas in order to prevent a 29,000-year dark age. But coming out of a 50's mindset, he's actually got very different ideas. Dropping the dark age from 30,000 years, down to a thousand, isn't actually about the preservation of knowledge, but the spread of it through religion and the reestablishment of commerce. Interestingly though, since Asimov was an atheist, he gave us the religion of science. Here is the origin of the tech-priest, the figure who reveres technology without understanding it, knowing only the rites and rituals to repair it or make it operate. And this religion of science, in these books, serves as both a critique of religion and those who make no attempt to actually understand the technology they use. So, Foundation, that idea Asimov had on the way to the office would inject into sci-fi space empires, tech priests, and pre-science. It would become the only book series to ever win the Hugo award for best all time series, beating out Lord of the Rings. It inspired people from noble prize winning economists, to some of the seminal thinkers behind positive psychology. From a former speaker of the house, to, well, Elon Musk. It influenced work ranging from Star Wars to the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. And I personally can't see it not having some impact on Frank Herbert when he was penning Dune. You know, what with the whole feudal space empires, discussion of pre-science, and religion-created-for-a-purpose thing it had going on. Today, foundation may seem dated with characters that are a little flat and language that's so clearly from 1940's Earth, that it seems a little out of place in the far future. But it will probably always remain one of the works that any true student of science fiction must read because of its Titanic influence on everything that came after. So that's it for Asimov, the great idea man of the Golden age. Join us next time for Robert Heinlein, one of the most controversial figures in sci-fi. We'll see you then. (music) "
262,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,8PUi0I02Mdc,"At last we have reached the Solvay conference of 1927, where the two most powerful voices  in physics Einstein and Bohr began an intellectual sparring match to determine the very way we understand reality while aspects of these debates continue even to today, Einstein's main goal was to take down the idea of complementarity and the uncertainty principle, concepts upon which many of the most unsettling aspects  of quantum mechanics hang. It was like an elaborate game. Einstein would offer brilliant thought experiments that violated complementarity and the uncertainty principle and Bohr would have  to dismantle them to keep his understanding  of quantum mechanics alive. So get your brains ready. This is gonna get science-y. Brussels, October 27th, the fifth Solvay conference begins. This may be the greatest meeting of minds humanity has ever assembled. Heisenberg, Dirac, Curie, De Broglie, Planck, Pauli, Lawrence, Born, and of course, Bohr and Einstein are all in attendance. One by one, lectures are given and long stretches of discussion  while away the hours Then, on the third day of the conference, its Heisenberg  and Born's turn to speak. As they near the close of their remarks they include a short statement saying that they considered the fundamental tenets of quantum mechanics to be established to the point where no modification  to them would occur. Everyone knows Einstein famously disagrees. But he remained silent. Before the conference began, Einstein had said that he would probably just be an observer, citing that quantum mechanics, the theme of the conference, was not his area  of expertise. And so, he kept his objections to himself. But then later, Bohr restates the idea that the fundamentals  of quantum mechanics are settled. At this, Einstein gets up and walks over  to Lorentz, who was running the conference, and says: ""Despite being conscious  of the fact that I have not entered deeply enough  into the essence of quantum mechanics, nevertheless, I'd like to present some general remarks."" by which he means: ""I would very much like to lay  the smack-down, please."" He walks up to a chalkboard and proposes a mechanism that utilizes the idea of conservation of momentum to violate the uncertainty principle. His argument went like this: imagine our double slit experiment  from the first episode. Now put another barrier  with a single slit in it between our beam of light and our double slit wall. When we fire  our light through that slit, we have to treat it as a wave form which means just as in our original experiment, when that wave form passes through the two slits on the second wall the two wave forms  it produces will interfere with each other and give us  the interference pattern we are so used to. But since light's also a particle, the only thing  that could have possibly deflected the particle-like nature  of the light would be bouncing off the first wall. There are no other variables  or components in the experiment. So that's  the only possibility. But now, imagine that first wall is on ball bearings and can move. By the laws of conservation of momentum, if we measure which way  and by how much the first wall was moved by the impact of the photon bouncing off it, we should be able to trace its path and tell which slit the photon will eventually  go through on the second wall. If the wall was pushed  a little bit south, then we know the photon bounced off it and got reflected north, heading towards  the northernly slit on the second wall, right ? But that can't be the case because if you remember from our discussion of wave- particle duality while basically everything operates like a wave and a particle, things don't operate as both at once. Things like light are a possibility wave until that wave is collapsed by someone trying to measure it; at which point, stuff like the location of the photon within the space of possibility has to be resolved. So, by that logic, we shouldn't be able to tell which slit on the second wall a photon will go through, which is particle-like behavior, and get an interference pattern for where those photons land on the screen behind it. Because, in order for the wave pattern to interfere with each other on the other side, the light would have to be acting like it was a wave as it passed through both slits. If we could observe both the wave aspects and of the particle aspects of light simultaneously, that would violate indeterminacy and thus unseat the uncertainty principle. But Bohr had an answer. He basically said that Einstein had set up a strawman here. He hadn't removed uncertainty; he had just moved the uncertainty from one place to another without realizing it. You see, in order to measure how much rolling that first wall did as a result of being hit with one photon, you'd have to know the exact location and the movement of the wall itself before the photon hit it. And because we're dealing with one photon here, you'd have to be incredibly precise: precise to a level that quantum rules kick in. And dealing at the quantum level means we run into indeterminancy, You can't know both the momentum and the location of the wall with perfect accuracy. So, yes, Einstein's example would violate indeterminacy, but the only way his example works is if you ignore indeterminacy first. Q. E. D. Not bad for a first round. Over the rest of the conference, with a spirit of camaraderie, Einstein would assail Bohr with other, less intense thought experiments and Bohr would respond parrying and thrusting back. Soon, the real conference was going on in the dining halls in the hotel hallways, with everyone getting in on the discussion. And so, with the spirit of inquiry and joy, the first real test of quantum mechanics was overcome. But Einstein wasn't totally satisfied. The next Solvay Conference would come in three year's time and this time, Einstein would come bearing gifts. More specifically, he would bring Bohr a box of light. Einstein shows up to the next conference and walks up to Bohr and he says, ""Imagine a box whose walls are perfectly reflective mirrors. Inside the box, there's light bouncing around. There's also a clock built into the box and at a specific time, this clock will open a hole in the side of the box for however long it takes for one photon to get out."" Einstein then waits to see if Bohr will see what's coming. Then, he says, ""Weigh the box."" Bohr goes pale. He starts wandering around the conference like a man in the aftermath of a natural disaster, going from person to person, saying, ""It can't be true.  It can't be true."" You see, he realized what Einstein is saying. If you weigh the box, before the photon leaves it, and then weigh it again after, you'll know the mass of the photon. And thanks to Einstein's own insight that E=mc², if you know the mass of a thing, you know its energy. When the uncertainty principle and complementarity are batted around in science fiction novels or Popular Mechanics articles, usually all anyone ever talks about is the fact that you can't find the position and momentum of a particle with absolute certainty. But there are a number of other complementary pieces of information which these principles also say you can't know both aspects of absolutely. One of them is energy and time. According to the uncertainty principle. you can't know the exact energy  of a particle at an exact time. But that's what Einstein's box  appears to successfully do. The clock gives an absolute time and the weight of the photon allows us to determine its energy at that exact moment. So Bohr retreats to his room, stunned, muttering that, ""It's the end  of physics if Einstein's right."" Sleepless, he works the problem through the night. He draws a diagram of the box; he imagines the experiment as if he was actually going to do it. Then, as dawn nears, it hits him. With a smile, he lays down to catch  a few hours of sleep. He'll be ready to unveil  his total triumph in the morning. And so, it was with mounting excitement in the crowd he addressed the gathering  the next morning. He explained that, if a photon escapes the box, then the box itself must recoil by the laws of conservation of momentum. By how much? Well, due to the uncertainty principle, we can't know precisely. But this fact itself proved nothing. This was an issue of momentum and Einstein's argument was dealing  specifically with energy and time. But then, Bohr administered  the coup de grâce: in order to weigh the box, that box would have to be within a gravitational field. After all, weight means nothing without gravity. But, by Einstein's very own theory of relativity, we know that gravity distorts spacetime and, for an object moving through a gravitational field, how quickly time moves is affected by that distortion. It's why you'll hear people talk about how time moves faster on a mountaintop or why time might stop near the center of a black hole. Thanks to gravity's distortion of spacetime, we can't tell exactly how much the clock within it was affected by that movement. HENCE, UNCERTAINTY. Now that was a gross generalization of Bohr's answer; and there are plenty of physicists, who over the years, have suggested  that Bohr's solution here was flawed or that they have a better solution. But the principle still stood: Bohr had bested Einstein  using his own theory. And so, Bohr's understanding of the quantum world came to be accepted by the majority of the scientific community. Basically, through today. So why walk through the Solvay conferences? Well, because, without seeing the pieces  being put into place, it's hard to fully accept what comes next. The real thing that Einstein found so upsetting about quantum theory was something he called, ""spooky action at a distance"", which we know today is the violation of local realism. Because once we have that and the uncertainty principle, the idea that energy comes in quanta and the fact you can superimpose two quantum states and have them interfere with each other, like we saw with the waves in the double slit experiment; once we've got all that stuff, which you've hopefully come to  at least grudgingly accept here, then, we can come to understand the power and the challenges of the quantum computer. I Know Zoe, my head's spinning, too. "
263,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,8dgoeYPoE-0,"Beneath your ribs, you'll find, among other things, the pancreas, an organ that works a lot  like a personal health coach. This organ controls your sugar levels and produces a special juice that releases the nutrients from your food to help keep you in the best possible shape. The pancreas sits just  behind your stomach, an appropriate home, as one of its jobs is to break down the food you eat. It aids digestion by producing  a special tonic made of water, sodium bicarbonate, and digestive enzymes. Sodium bicarbonate neutralizes the stomach's natural acidity, so these digestive enzymes can perform their jobs. Lipase breaks down fatty substances, protease splits up proteins, and amylase divides carbohydrates to create energy-rich sugars. Most of those nutrients then get absorbed into the blood stream, and go on to enrich the body. While all this is happening, the pancreas works on another critical task, controlling the amount  of sugar in your blood. It achieves this with the hormones  insulin and glucagon, which are produced in special cells called the Islets of Langerhans. Having too much or too little sugar can be life threatening, so the pancreas must  stay on constant alert. After a big meal, the blood often becomes flushed with sugar. To bring us back to normal, the pancreas releases insulin, which makes the excess sugar  move into cells, where it's either used  as an energy source, or stored for later. Insulin also tells the liver to shut down sugar production. On the other hand, if blood sugar is low, the pancreas releases a hormone called glucagon that tells the body's cells and liver to release stored sugars back into the bloodstream. The interplay between insulin and glucagon is what keeps our sugar levels balanced. But a faulty pancreas can no longer coach us like this, meaning that this healthy  balance is destroyed. If it's weakened by disease, the organ's ability to produce insulin may be reduced, or even extinguished, which can trigger the condition known as diabetes. Without regular insulin release, sugar steadily builds up in the blood, eventually hardening the blood vessels and causing heart attacks, kidney failure, and strokes. The same lack of insulin deprives cells of the energy-rich sugar they need to grow and function. People with diabetes also tend to have higher levels of glucagon, which makes even more sugar circulate. Without this internal health coach, our sugar levels would go haywire, and we wouldn't be able  to digest important nutrients. But like any coach, it's not the pancreas' job  alone to keep us healthy. It needs our conscious participation, too. "
264,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,8diYLhl8bWU,"What do Charles Darwin, Michael Jordan, and Yoda have in common? They, like many other historical and fictive individuals, are bald, in some cases by their own choice. For centuries, a shining dome has been a symbol of intelligence, but despite this, many balding people still wish their hair would return. Scientists have long pondered, ""Why do some people lose their hair, and how can we bring it back?"" The full-headed among us have about 100,000 to 150,000 hairs on our scalps, and scientists have discovered two things about this dense thicket. Firstly, the sprouting hair we see is mostly made up of keratin, the protein leftover from dead cells that are forced upwards as new cells grow beneath them. Secondly, the structures  that drive hair growth are called hair follicles, a network of complex organs that forms before we're born, and grows hair in an everlasting cycle. This cycle has three main phases. The first is anagen, the growth phase, which up to 90% of your hair follicles are experiencing right now, causing them to push up hair at a rate of one centimeter per month. Anagen can last for two to seven years, depending on your genes. After this productive period, signals within the skin instruct some follicles to enter a new phase known as catagen, or the regressing stage, causing hair follicles to shrink to a fraction of their original length. Catagen lasts for about two to three weeks and cuts blood supply to the follicle, creating a club hair, meaning it's ready to be shed. Finally, hairs enter telogen, the resting phase, which lasts for ten to twelve weeks, and affects about 5-15% of your scalp follicles. During telogen, up to 200 club hairs can be shed in a day, which is quite normal. Then, the growth cycle begins anew. But not all heads are hairy, and, in fact, some of them grow increasingly patchy over time in response to bodily changes. 95% of baldness in men can be attributed to male pattern baldness. Baldness is inherited, and in people with this condition, follicles become incredibly sensitive to the effects of dihydrotestosterone, a hormonal product  made from testosterone. DHT causes shrinkage in these overly sensitive follicles, making hair shorter and wispier. But loss isn't sudden. It happens gradually, along a metric known as the Norwood Scale, which describes the severity of hair loss. First, hair recedes along the temples, then hair on the crown begins to thin in a circular pattern. At the highest rating on the scale, these balding areas meet  and expand dramatically, eventually leaving only a ring of sparse hair around the temples and the back of the head. Genetics isn't all that drives hair loss. Long periods of stress can release signals that shock follicles and force them into  the resting phase prematurely. Some women experience this after childbirth. Follicles might also lose the ability to go into anagen, the growth phase. People going through chemotherapy treatment temporarily experience this. But while balding may look permanent, scientific investigation  has revealed the opposite. Below the skin's surface, the roots that give rise to our hair actually remain alive. Using this knowledge, scientists have developed drugs that shorten the resting phase, and force follicles into anagen. Other drugs combat male pattern baldness by blocking the conversion of testosterone to DHT so that it doesn't affect  those sensitive follicles. Stem cells also play a role in regulating the growth cycle, and so scientists are investigating whether they can manipulate the activity of these cells to encourage follicles to start producing hair again. And in the meantime, while scientists hone  their hair-reviving methods, anyone going bald, or considering baldness, can remember that  they're in great company. "
265,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,8qK0hxuXOC8,"Most people will take a pill, receive an injection, or otherwise take some kind of medicine during their lives, but most of us don't know anything about how these substances actually work. How can various compounds impact the way we physically feel, think, and even behave? For the most part, this depends on how a drug alters the communication between cells in the brain. There are a number of different ways that can happen. But before it gets into the brain, any drug must first reach the bloodstream on a journey that can take anywhere from seconds to hours, depending on factors like how it's administered. The slowest method is to take a drug orally because it must be absorbed by our digestive system before it takes effect. Inhaling a drug gets it into the bloodstream faster. And injecting a drug intravenously works quickly too because it pumps the chemicals directly into the blood. Once there, the drug quickly reaches the gates of its destination, the brain. The entrance to this organ is guarded by the blood-brain barrier, which separates blood  from the nervous system to keep potentially dangerous substances out. So all drugs must have a specific chemical composition which gives them the key to unlock this barrier and pass through. Once inside, drugs start to interfere with the brain's normal functioning by targeting its web of neurons  and synapses. Neurons are brain cells that have a nucleus, dendrites, and an axon. Synapses are structures placed along the dendrites or the axon which allow the exchange of electrochemical signals between neurons. Those signals take the form of chemicals called neurotransmitters. Each neurotransmitter plays different roles in regulating our behaviors, emotions, and cognition. But they all work in one of two ways. They can either inhibit  the receiving neuron, limiting its activity, or excite it, creating a new electrochemical signal that spreads throughout the network. Any leftover neurotransmitter usually gets degraded or reabsorbed  into the transmitting neuron. A drug's effectiveness stems  from its ability to manipulate these synaptic transmissions at different phases of the process. That results in an increase or a decrease in the amount of neurotransmitters being spread. For instance, common antidepressants, like SSRIs, stop the reabsorption of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates our moods. This effectively pushes more of it into the neural network. Meanwhile, painkillers, like morphine, raise levels of serotonin and noradrenaline, which regulate energy, arousal, alertness, and pleasure. Those same neurotransmitters also affect endorphin receptors, reducing pain perception. And tranquilizers works by increasing the production of GABA to inhibit neural activity putting the person in a relaxed or sedated state. What about illegal or elicit drugs? These have powerful impacts on the brain that we're still trying to understand. Crystal meth, an amphetamine, induces a long-lasting release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter linked with the perception of reward and pleasure. It also activates noradrenaline receptors, which increases the heart rate, dilates pupils, and triggers the body's fight or flight response. Cocaine blocks the reuptake of dopamine and serotonin, pushing more into the network where they boost energy, create feelings of euphoria, and suppress appetites. And hallucinogenic drugs have some of the most puzzling effects. Substances like LSD, mescaline, and DMT all block the release of serotonin, which regulates mood and impulsivity. They also have an impact on the neural circuits involved in perception, learning, and behavioral regulation, which may explain why these drugs have such powerful impacts. Even if some of these  effects sound exciting, there are reasons why some of these drugs are highly controlled and often illegal. Drugs have the power to alter the brain's chemistry, and repeated use can permanently rewire the neural networks that support our ability to think, make decisions, learn, and remember things. There's a lot we still don't know about drugs and their effects, both the good and the bad. But those we do know about are the ones we've studied closely, and turned into effective medicines. As our knowledge grows about drugs and the brain, the possibilities will also increase for treating the many medical problems that puzzle researchers today. "
266,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,91XI7M9l3no,"As 1905 dawned, the soon-to-be 26-year-old Albert Einstein faced life as a failed academic. Most physicists of the time would have scoffed at the idea that this minor civil servant could have much to contribute to science. Yet within the following year, Einstein would publish not one, not two, not three, but four extraordinary papers, each on a different topic, that were destined to radically transform our understanding of the universe. The myth that Einstein had failed math is just that. He had mastered calculus on his own by the age of 15 and done well at both his Munich secondary school and at the Swiss Polytechnic, where he studied for a math and physics teaching diploma. But skipping classes to spend more time in the lab and neglecting to show proper deference to his professors had derailed his intended career path. Passed over even for a lab assistant position, he had to settle for a job at the Swiss patent office, obtained with the help of a friend's father. Working six days a week as a patent clerk, Einstein still managed to make some time for physics, discussing the latest work with a few close friends, and publishing a couple of minor papers. It came as a major surprise when in March 1905 he submitted a paper with a shocking hypothesis. Despite decades of evidence that light was a wave, Einstein proposed that it could, in fact, be a particle, showing that mysterious phenomena, such as the photoelectric effect, could be explained by his hypothesis. The idea was derided for years to come, but Einstein was simply twenty years ahead of his time. Wave-particle duality was slated to become a cornerstone of the quantum revolution. Two months later in May, Einstein submitted a second paper, this time tackling the centuries old question of whether atoms actually exist. Though certain theories were built on the idea of invisible atoms, some prominent scientists still believed them to be a useful fiction, rather than actual physical objects. But Einstein used an ingenious argument, showing that the behavior of small particles randomly moving around in a liquid, known as Brownian motion, could be precisely predicted by the collisions of millions of invisible atoms. Experiments soon confirmed Einstein's model, and atomic skeptics threw in the towel. The third paper came in June. For a long time, Einstein had been troubled by an inconsistency between two fundamental principles of physics. The well established principle of relativity, going all the way back to Galileo, stated that absolute motion could not be defined. Yet electromagnetic theory, also well established, asserted that absolute motion did exist. The discrepancy, and his inability to resolve it, left Einstein in what he described as a state of psychic tension. But one day in May, after he had mulled over the puzzle with his friend Michele Besso, the clouds parted. Einstein realized that the contradiction could be resolved if it was the speed of light that remained constant, regardless of reference frame, while both time and space were relative to the observer. It took Einstein only a few weeks to work out the details and formulate what came to be known as special relativity. The theory not only shattered our previous understanding of reality but would also pave the way for technologies, ranging from particle accelerators, to the global positioning system. One might think that this was enough, but in September, a fourth paper arrived as a ""by the way"" follow-up to the special relativity paper. Einstein had thought a little bit more about his theory, and realized it also implied that mass and energy, one apparently solid and the other supposedly ethereal, were actually equivalent. And their relationship could be expressed in what was to become the most famous and consequential equation in history: E=mc^2. Einstein would not become a world famous icon for nearly another fifteen years. It was only after his later general theory of relativity was confirmed in 1919 by measuring the bending of starlight during a solar eclipse that the press would turn him into a celebrity. But even if he had disappeared back into the patent office and accomplished nothing else after 1905, those four papers of his miracle year would have remained the gold standard of startling unexpected genius.

268,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,9BjIYKq4CVk,"For five years, execution, torture, and vicious oppression has been the fate of the Poles. But resistance, the will to fight the Nazis who occupy their homeland, has been kept alive. In the face of unspeakable brutality, The Polish Home Army, the volunteer force of resistance fighters secretly living in Poland, has continued to grow. For these fighters, discovery meant instant death. But with sabotage, indirection, and a message of hope for the people, they kept the Germans from ever feeling secure in occupied Poland. And now it was time. Russian shelling could be heard in the streets of Warsaw. Liberation was at hand. But the Home Army wasn't going to wait for the Russians to march into their capital and return to them, whatever portion of their country they felt generous enough to give. The Warsaw Uprising was about to begin. A few months ago, James was invited to Poland to attend one of their massive game jams and observe what they're doing to help grow the games industry there. With any luck, he'll get back there for their game jam in September and I'll be hiding in his luggage to go visit my homeland. Because while in Warsaw, he fell in love with the city and its history. So much so that he worked with the folks running the game jam to help sponsor this special episode so he could talk about one of the greatest tragedies of the 20th century. So, let's begin. August 1st, 1944. The Allies have landed in Normandy. Rome has fallen. And the Soviets have pushed the German war machine off Russian soil. And in Warsaw, a people oppressed for five long years are about to rise up against their oppressors. But what precipitates this is the approach of the Soviet Army. Because the history between the Soviets and Poland is a fraught one. In 1939, as allies of Hitler, Soviet forces stormed over the Polish border, taking Poland by surprise and collapsing Polish defenses. Up to that point, while not winning the war against Germany, the Polish Army was taking their toll. Slowing down German forces and making them pay for every inch of ground. But to do this, almost all of their forces were sent to the West, never expecting an attack from the supposedly neutral Soviet Union. When Soviet forces poured over the eastern border, it spelt the end for the Polish Army. Two weeks later, Poland would surrender and more than half would be annexed by the Soviet Union until they in turn lost it to the Nazis double-crossing them. And while not as systematically brutal as Nazi occupation, the Soviet domination of Poland was still horrific. They rounded up and shot 22.000 Poles in the Katyn forest. And even when they joined the Allies, they refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Polish government-in-exile. All of which means that many in the Polish resistance believed that the only way they'd have a seat at the table after the war is if they liberated their own country. Which leads us back to the 1st of August. The Russians are a few dozen kilometers away. As their advance continues, The Germans are guaranteed to fall. It's now or never, it's time to rise up. The previous night, a tense meeting had occurred and ""W hour"", the start of the Polish uprising was declared. The troops had trained for a surprise attack at dawn. But at the last minute, plans changed. The uprising was now set for 5:00 P.M. But it's hard to hide that many people spoiling for a fight and by 5:00 P.M., sporadic engagements had already broken out across the city. The Polish troops were barely armed many without weapons at all. Charging in with homemade submachine guns or captured German rifles. They took the gasworks, the power and water plants, and some vital production facilities, but they were repulsed in key locations as well. The bridges, the airport, the rail line, and the main police station all remained in German hands. Most crucially though, they failed to link up. By night, groups were erecting barricades. The city was now divided and though there would be some coordination and reinforcements, many pockets were now fighting in their own small wars. Then the bombs begin to fall. The Luftwaffe is laying waste to the city. Not differentiating between civilian areas and those controlled by the resistance. The Polish Home Army doesn't have a single anti-aircraft gun and all eyes look for signs of the Soviet air force. But no planes sporting the Red Star of Russia are anywhere to be seen. Four days into the uprising, the true atrocities start. On orders of Heinrich Himmler, German troops begin going house-to-house, shooting every inhabitant they find. The old, the infirm, women, children, all were gunned down. Over the course of a week, tens of thousands of civilians are murdered as they huddled in their homes. But the Polish resistance didn't break. The Home Army ground the Germans to a halt. Though it's strongest battalions were also its most tragic, ""The Grey Ranks"". They were made up of the boy scouts. Older scouts were frontline troops, better organized, better trained, better disciplined, than most of the volunteers. The younger members ran courier duty while the girl scouts served as combat medics, nurses, and munition haulers. And they all swore an oath. ""I pledge to you that I shall serve the grey ranks, safeguard the secrets of the organization, obey orders, and not hesitate to sacrifice my life."" And they would hold this oath, all the way, unto their death. They fought house-to-house, door-to-door, in the chaotic melee of city fighting. Classmates died side by side, first loves torn apart by machine-gun fire. They referred to each other as bees, because they were a hive. A collective and they would sting the Germans. They fought with the fury only possessed by the young and the righteous and they pushed the Nazis from the burnt-out remains of the Warsaw ghetto. They cut into the German line far enough to liberate one of the concentration camps. 384 Jews who had survived the extermination of the ghetto were still in prison there. And they took up arms to fight against those who had enslaved them, who had murdered everyone they knew. But then, the young fighters of the grey ranks were faced with the unthinkable. Something I don't know as a human being you could face. German tanks rolled forward, but it wasn't the hundred tons of steel and death that stopped the scouts. They had faced tanks before, armed only with rifles and hand grenades. No. It was what was in front of the tanks, because in front of those tanks, were women. Some burned or beaten, all Polish. The Nazis were using them as human shields It was this the scouts couldn't face. So the advance turned to a stalemate and still aid did not come. By the end of August, the undersupplied Polish forces had to withdraw from Warsaw as old town, making their way through the sewers to more easily held points. For nearly a month, the soldiers and many of the civilians had been living off barley from a brewery the grey ranks had captured early in the fighting. Soon even water was scarce, with waterways clogged with corpses and the Germans cutting off remaining water mains as they advanced. At last, on the 15th of September Soviet forces appeared on the far banks of the Vistula. A crossing attempt is made, but Soviet command only sent the lightly armored division of Polish volunteers who had joined them after the fall of Poland to try to relieve Warsaw. Of the 1.600 men, who went more than a thousand fell to German guns. The Soviets decide that a crossing was impractical and no further attempt would be made to aid the Polish partisans. Meanwhile, America finally attempts an airdrop of supplies, but 80% of it is accidentally dropped behind German lines. American forces will not try again. The resistance is shelled day and night, great mortars with shells 2 feet in diameter, rained down on them. Rockets slam into the few remaining upright buildings and tanks hammer away at foxholes for scouts armed with no more than rifles. The Germans advance on the Mokka Tube district. The resistance is pushed back. They enter one of the major hospitals under Polish control and they execute every wounded soldier and all of the hospital's personnel. Again, the resistance flees through the sewers but a 150 of them exit too early and are killed by German troops. The Poles now control only a few square blocks right against the river They were surrounded, starving, outgunned, and outnumbered, and yet they fought not like bees but like wasps. Every house was a stronghold, every doorway a bunker, and they fought within sight of the Soviet Army across the river yet no aid came. They fought with the determination of the damned. They fought and fell. The outcome was inevitable. Surrender had to come. Germans weary of fighting and interested in concentrating on the Soviet threat offered terms. The entire population of Warsaw was to be expelled but no one was to be executed. The terms were accepted. The resistance fighters spent their last days forging documents for the Jewish members among them. 15,000 of the Home Army were taken away as POWs and 500.000 civilians were shipped out of the city. The lucky ones were simply let go with no homes, no food, no jobs. But 60,000 ended up in the death camps and 90.000 more found themselves unloaded at forced labor yards. And after the surrender, Himmler said, ""The city must completely disappear from the surface of the earth and serve only as a transport station for the Wehrmacht."" ""No stone can remain standing, every building must be raised to its foundation"" And in one of the last great acts of senseless destruction, perpetrated by the Nazi regime, German engineers took flamethrowers and dynamite and systematically, building by building, block by block, wiped Warsaw off the map. By the time 3 months later, when the Russians finally crossed the Vistula, 85% of the buildings in Warsaw had been leveled. Monuments, schools, libraries, historical sites all reduced to rubble and ash. If you go to the historic district of Warsaw today what you're actually seeing is a reconstruction. An attempt to rebuild based on old photographs and paintings. If you walk the halls of the Royal Castle, you're not seeing a building that's been standing for 400 years. Instead you walk through a palace completed in 1984 and in the rubble of that city, lay 70% of the young people of the grey ranks. But their sacrifice was not forgotten for their nation still stands, long after the thousand-year Reich was wiped from the earth. "
269,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,9NVT6iZP2qg,"A cholera outbreak had struck Broad Street. The death count mounted and the moans of the sick could be heard through thin tenement walls. It was down this street, that John Snow walked. Knocking on door after door after door. But many had already fled and the cold blue end of cholera had claimed many of those who had not. Again, John Snow was frustrated in getting the evidence he sought. But this time, the clock was ticking Every passing minute meant more deaths. And every passing minute decreased his chances of preventing this from ever happening again. And so, by noon on Tuesday the 4th of September, 1854, he realised that there'd be only one place he could quickly and efficiently get the data he so desperately needed; the office of the Registrar General. He raced from Broad Street to the halls of the Government, demanding a full list of every death and an address for everyone the cholera had taken. And so, he began to establish a pattern of how these things were done. On ground inspection combined with combing government records to get the data needed not just to treat the disease, but to fight it. And fight it he would. Right there on Broad Street. He returned to the epicenter, with its air of suffering and death so that he could understand what those addresses he now held meant. His boot heels rang out against the pavers of the abandoned streets as he paced from house to house, trying to see the connection. Then he had it! Of course! He needed to think of these deaths as a map. And so he began to craft his map. plotting the deaths one by one. And as his map filled out with tragedy, a pattern began to emerge. It really was an epidemic starting at Broad Street and radiating out, thinning the further it went. But he knew that already. He needed more. He needed to show that the pump itself was the source. He needed to know not only how these points of mortality were related to each other, but also how they related to the neighbourhood wells. So he made what we today know as a Voronoi diagram. But to him, it was something he was making up of the top of his head in a desperate attempt to find the fastest way to understand the problem he faced. He marked the wells on the map, then he split the map in to sections according to proximity to the wells. Any deaths that was closer to one specific well than to any other would be grouped together. The idea being that well water was well water and people were probably getting their water from whatever pump was convenient. So if you broke up the map by proximity to wells and you saw a pattern in where the most deaths occurred, you'd be able to tell if there was a contaminated well. And there it was clear as day. People who had a shorter walk to the Broad Street pump than to any other well, were inordinately more likely to die. But he had been down this road before. He knew this wouldn't Ben enough to convince the miasmatists. they would just say that some noxious stench hung around the region of the pump and that the pump itself was coincidental. Nope, he needed something more. So he poured over his map. There were a few outliers. There, right there! On Cross Street! There was a clump of deaths that were closer to the Little Marlborough pump than the one on Broad Street. He raced to the tenement to see if he could get some answers, But he was too late. Those had only been the first deaths marked down in the Registrar General's morning notes. By afternoon, the entire family had been wiped out. Of all the 84 deaths he had on record, only 8 more were outside the area he'd marked as closest to the Broad Street pump. He needed to follow those leads. 3 were tragically children who went to school near Broad Street and would drink from the well on their way to and from their education. 3 more were workers who also regularly stopped at the well. The last 2 he couldn't get data for. This still left him with clear connections to the pump, even for those who were outside its range and equally importantly outside the range of any argument about a miasmatic cloud. But he needed to understand the other holes in his data as well. On Poland Street there was a massive workhouse with 535 inhabitants and yet almost no-one there had died. And it was well within the range of the Broad Street pump. There should be 10 times as many deaths there, at least. He rushed to the workhouse, feeling the daylight burning as each precious minute slipped away. He had to hurry. Upon questioning the workhouse director, the answer became glaringly obvious: The workhouse had its own private water supply. Of course! Snow pressed the director further: ""Where do you get your water from?"" and the director replied: ""Grand Junction water works."" Snow already knew that Grand Junction water was safe based on his earlier research. It was all starting to make sense. Next he had to go to the local brewery. There they told him (teetotaler that he was) that their men drank nothing but beer. All the pieces fit, he had his case. Now he just had to convince the local health board to shut down the well. Now this had all happened within the first 48 hours of Snow's finding out about the outbreak. For 48 hours, he had trudged through the streets that others had fled. He'd visited the sick, he'd recorded the statements of the bereaved, for 48 hours he had mapped, made statistical plots, studied and chased down data. And now on Thursday night, after a brief rest, he prepared for what might be an even greater challenge: the meeting of the local health commission. He addressed them with all of the vigor and certainty of his data. He showed them his maps and his charts. He let them know the egregious mortality rate of those who had drunk from the well and the remarkable clemency granted to those who had not. And in the end after much deliberation they said: ""Hmpf, you might know something, John Snow!"" And they agreed to remove the handle from the pump the following morning. Now, whether or not the outbreak would have burned itself out over the next few days on its own is up for debate. But what IS certain is that by Monday, the epidemic had practically passed. But after the epidemic had ended, the pump handle was returned and life went on. Investigations into the outbreak began. And most minds of the time went right back to thinking of things in terms of the miasma theory of disease. But a young curate who was the Minister to the people of Broad Street and had sat with many of them during their final hours went further. This man (Henry Whitehead) began doing a serious investigation of his own to make sense of the whole thing. Deeply disturbed by why this had happened to his parish, he began writing monographs on his results and debunking the theories that so many had offered. Especially about this outbreak being the result of the lax morals of the poor. One of the theories he thought he would debunk along the way was that silly notion John Snow had about the pump having something to do with the outbreak. But he never got around to it. Then, in November, a committee was formed to really look into the outbreak and both Whitehead and Snow were invited to be on it. And here, Whitehead really began to test Snow's results. After all, sure Snow had shown that people who had drunk from the pump suffered. But what of those who survived? If they had drunk from the pump and never gotten cholera, would that not put into question the water as a cause? And as a local prelate, Whitehead could do what Snow could not; reach out to all of those in the local area that hadn't fallen ill. His knowledge of the people of the area and their intimate trust of him as their priest actually allowed him to get the last pieces of data that Snow had needed. And as that data came in, his doubts about Snow's ideas began to melt away. But there was one final piece to the puzzle: Why now? The Broad Street pump had served the people well for years. It was groundwater not water from one of the contaminated vendors. And when the city had studied it, they'd find no cracks that might have connected it to a sewage system. He was looking for a reason, flipping through the records of the office of the Registrar General, and that's when he found it. The index case, patient zero. An infant - one who he remembered well - had died in the outbreak. But unlike most patients, this tiny child had - according to the records in the Registrar's office - held out for 4 days. That would put her case as predating the epidemic. Immediately he went to the house of this child's mother, a woman who knew him well from the community. He asked about those days and she talked about how she had tossed child's diapers into a cesspool at the bottom of the house. The committee immediately authorized an examination of the cesspit and a new examination of the well. Sure enough, the cesspool was poorly built and was seeping as much into the soil around it as into the sewer to which it was supposed to drain. Two feet away, through that soil, lay the Broad Street well. With that final piece of data they had all they needed. The committee would release its report and that report would be dismissed or ignored by many at the time, but today we know as a report that changed the world. But perhaps Snow himself put it best. Talking to Whitehead he said: ""You and I may not live to see the day and my name may be forgotten when it comes, but the time will arrive when great outbreaks of cholera will be things of the past. And it is knowledge of the way in which the disease is propagated which will cause them to disappear."" And it is because of the tireless sleuthing of John Snow that that day is here. History has not forgotten you. You do know something John Snow. "

In that moment, you may feel more like throwing your battery across the room than singing its praises, but batteries are a triumph of science. They allow smartphones and other technologies to exist without anchoring us to an infernal tangle of power cables. Yet even the best batteries will diminish daily, slowly losing capacity  until they finally die. So why does this happen, and how do our batteries even store so much charge in the first place? It all started in the 1780s with two Italian scientists, Luigi Galvani and Alessandro Volta, and a frog. Legend has it that as Galvani was studying a frog's leg, he brushed a metal instrument  up against one of its nerves, making the leg muscles jerk. Galvani called this animal electricity, believing that a type of electricity was stored in the very stuff of life. But Volta disagreed, arguing that it was the metal itself that made the leg twitch. The debate was eventually settled with Volta's groundbreaking experiment. He tested his idea with a stack of alternating layers of zinc and copper, separated by paper or cloth soaked in a salt water solution. What happened in Volta's cell is something chemists now call oxidation and reduction. The zinc oxidizes, which means it loses electrons, which are, in turn, gained by the ions in the water in a process called reduction, producing hydrogen gas. Volta would have been shocked  to learn that last bit. He thought the reaction was happening in the copper, rather than the solution. None the less, we honor Volta's discovery today by naming our standard unit of electric potential ""the volt."" This oxidation-reduction cycle creates a flow of electrons between two substances and if you hook a lightbulb or vacuum cleaner up between the two, you'll give it power. Since the 1700s, scientists have improved on Volta's design. They've replaced the chemical solution with dry cells filled with chemical paste, but the principle is the same. A metal oxidizes,  sending electrons to do some work before they are regained by a substance being reduced. But any battery has a finite  supply of metal, and once most of it has oxidized,  the battery dies. So rechargeable batteries give us  a temporary solution to this problem by making the oxidation-reduction  process reversible. Electrons can flow back in the opposite direction with the application of electricity. Plugging in a charger draws  the electricity from a wall outlet that drives the reaction  to regenerate the metal, making more electrons available  for oxidation the next time you need them. But even rechargeable batteries  don't last forever. Over time, the repetition of this process causes imperfections and irregularities in the metal's surface that prevent it from oxidizing properly. The electrons are no longer available to flow through a circuit and the battery dies. Some everyday rechargeable batteries will die after only hundreds of discharge-recharge cycles, while newer, advanced batteries can survive and function for thousands. Batteries of the future may be light, thin sheets that operate on the principles  of quantum physics and last for hundreds  of thousands of charge cycles. But until scientists find a way  to take advantage of motion to recharge your cell battery, like cars do, or fit solar panels somewhere on your device, plugging your charger into the wall, rather than expending  one battery to charge another is your best bet to forestall  that fatal ""bleep.""

271,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,9Pey-HmXGfs,"This was a letter to a German newspaper, December, 1914: ""Yesterday there was a fierce and terrible onslaught""... ...""of Christmas packages into our trenches."" ""Yesterday there was a fierce and terrible onslaught""... ...""of Christmas packages into our trenches."" ""No man was spared."" ""In the confusion, one soldier suffered a salami impaled straight into his stomach."" ""Another had raisins from an exploding pastry fly directly into his eyes."" ""A third had the misfortune of having a bottle of cognac fly into his mouth."" This holiday special is brought to you by World of Tanks. Use the invite code ""ARMISTICE"" if you are new player who wants to check out the game. World War I was a letter-writing war, one where pencil and paper were a soldier’s line of communication with friends and family. And reading those letters provides some insight into what life was like in the trenches. So today, let’s read some excerpts from those soldiers’ holiday letters. Of course, none of us at Extra Credits have ever experienced being deployed over the holidays, so real quick, I want to hand the mic to someone who has. Here’s Wargaming’s military specialist Richard Cutland back again to give us a little insight: In my 30 years of service, I was extremely fortunate to only spend around six Christmases away from home and family. The first was spent lying in a muddy ditch in Northern Ireland, where we had been ordered to set up an Observation Post to watch the comings and goings of a known IRA terrorist. Cold, wet, hungry, and tired - watching someone else celebrate Christmas with family and friends. It was certainly a low point for us all! As a young solider, the easiest thing to do was not think about it. It was merely another day amongst a multitude of ""other days"". The real heartbreak occurred after marriage and children. It was wrenching to explain why daddy would not be there on such a special day. Tales of ""helping Santa at the North Pole"" or ""having to feed the reindeer"" quickly wore thin as my children grew older and wiser. A soldier’s wife has much to contend with, and my own wife’s angst and worry during any Operational Tour was compounded when I was away for the holidays. The Army always tried their best if circumstances allowed. If you were near an HQ, the chefs would knock up a Christmas dinner with all the trimmings. Well, perhaps not all...but they did their best with what was available. Unfortunately, sitting with a hundred men wearing paper hats was not quite the same as Christmas Dinner with your family. Yet we were all aware it was necessary to spend such periods away, and let’s face it, it was part of the job. But it was always a killer to be told that a deployment was imminent, and Christmas would be cancelled. So to all those servicemen and women who find themselves away for this special time: I salute you and wish you and your family peace and happiness. Thank you, Richard. Let’s set the scene. It’s Boxing Day 1914, and private Henry Williamson is writing home about the most extraordinary Christmas of his life... ""I am writing from the trenches."" ""In my mouth is a pipe presented by the Princess Mary."" ""In the pipe is tobacco."" ""'Of course', you say. But wait."" ""In the pipe is German tobacco, from a German soldier."" ""Yes, a live German soldier from his own trench."" ""On Christmas Eve, both armies sang carols and cheered"" ""and there was very little firing."" ""The Germans called to our men to come and fetch a cigar,"" ""and our men told them to come to us."" ""This went on for some time until a bold Tommy crept out"" ""and stood between the trenches, and a Saxon came to meet him."" ""They shook hands and laughed. Thus the ice was broken."" ""Our men are speaking to them now."" German corporal Josef Wenzl was similarly amazed at the gathering. ""What I believed to be madness several hours ago"" ""I could see now with my own eyes."" ""Bavarians and English, until then the greatest of enemies,"" ""shook hands, talked and exchanged items."" ""A single star stood still in the sky directly above them,"" ""interpreted by many as a special sign from heaven."" ""More and more joined, and the entire line greeted each other."" ""For the rest of my life I shall never forget this scene."" ""Which goes to show that human feelings continue to go on, even if,"" ""in these times, men do not know anything but killing and murdering."" But not everyone held fire. British Rifleman John Erskine’s unit was fraternizing in no man’s land when a soldier, disobeying his officer’s order, shot one of the Germans. He writes ""The Germans immediately replied,"" ""and instead of firing on where the shot came from,"" ""they fired at the first person they saw."" ""Unfortunately this happened to be one of our corporals who was shot through the head."" ""A most regrettable fact connected with the affair"" ""was that he has three brothers in the battalion,"" ""and it must have had a disheartening effect on them."" ""The Germans apologised, but it left a black mark on the day."" Still, in many places the peace held until the generals ended it with artillery. The spirit of the Christmas truce would be rekindled the following year, albeit on a small scale. In December 1915, French soldier Louis Barthas found himself in a spontaneous ceasefire when heavy rain forced both sides to abandon their trenches... ""Frenchmen and Germans looked at each other, and saw that they were all men,"" ""no different from one another."" ""They smiled, exchanged comments; hands reached out and grasped."" ""We shared tobacco, a canteen of coffee or pinard."" ""One day, a huge devil of a German stood up on a mound and gave a speech,"" ""which only the Germans could understand word for word."" ""But everyone knew what it meant, because he smashed his rifle on a tree stump,"" ""breaking it in two."" ""Applause broke out on both sides."" ""Meanwhile, our big-shot leaders were in a furor."" ""What in the Lord’s name would happen if the soldiers refused to kill each other?"" German soldier Hermann Baur, also present, was thinking much the same. He wrote: ""The infantry does not shoot any more, just the crazy artillery""... ""The masters make war, they have a quarrel,"" ""and the workers, the little men""... ...""have to stand there fighting against each other."" ""Is that not a great stupidity?"" Once again, senior officers broke the truce with artillery and court-martial threats. The fighting began again, and Barthas would spend three more Christmases at war. The same was true for many others. In fact, Christmas of 1916... brought Canadian infantryman John McLean his first taste of combat. He wrote: ""Dear Mother"": ""I haven’t written for over a week now, but I couldn’t very well."" ""We went into the trenches on Christmas Eve and were in for six days."" ""It was not too bad at all, far better than I expected."" ""All our fellows came out fine except Jack Ivnor,"" ""he got a machine gun bullet through the leg."" ""The noise was awful, but a person will get used to that after a while."" ""I spent Christmas day in a dugout."" ""If I live to be 300 years old, I will never forget this Christmas week."" ""One night I was going up a trench and saw a big grey cat sitting on the parapet."" ""I would like to tell you more, but I can do that when I get home."" ""Now you are doing too much worrying. We are alright if a man is careful."" A month later, he was dead. Meanwhile another Canadian, Jack Davey, was having a bittersweet Christmas. He’d come home after months in a POW camp, only to find himself at a military hospital in Toronto, thousands of miles from his new fiancée. He wrote to her on Boxing Day: ""Darling Kitty, Many thanks for the letter and the card with Christmas wishes."" ""We had quite a snowstorm on Christmas Eve."" ""It’s quite a novelty to see a real white Christmas."" ""Yesterday was a lovely day. On the whole, I had a good time"" ""but I hope next year won’t be such a disappointment for us, sweetheart."" ""Surely this rotten luck of being separated at Christmas can’t go on forever."" ""One week has passed since I was measured for my leg."" ""I wish I could have it by the New Year, so I could start the year on both feet again."" ""It will soon be two years since I walked like a human being."" ""It seems a long time to talk about it, but I can picture those fields"" ""and imagine I can see the exact spot where I fell"" ""as though it only happened yesterday."" ""I guess it will be a long day before I forget it."" ""But I hope all the dark days are behind us now, sweetheart."" ""We just have to be happy and live long to make up for it all."" As the war ended and veterans trickled home, that’s exactly what they tried to do. Yet their holidays spent in the shadow of dugouts would never fully leave them. There are so many letters like these. Honestly, deciding which ones to include was the hardest part. But if this happened to capture your imagination, try something later. When you go home for the holidays, ask your relatives if they have any old letters lying around. It’s possible that the next story from the trenches might come from your own family. Happy Holidays, everybody. See you next year! "
272,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,9iMGFqMmUFs,"Water is virtually everywhere, from soil moisture and ice caps, to the cells inside our own bodies. Depending on factors like location, fat index, age, and sex, the average human is between 55-60% water. At birth, human babies are even wetter. Being 75% water, they are swimmingly similar to fish. But their water composition drops to 65% by their first birthday. So what role does water  play in our bodies, and how much do we actually need to drink to stay healthy? The H20 in our bodies works to cushion and lubricate joints, regulate temperature, and to nourish the brain and spinal cord. Water isn't only in our blood. An adult's brain and heart are almost three quarters water. That's roughly equivalent to the amount of moisture in a banana. Lungs are more similar to an apple at 83%. And even seemingly dry human bones are 31% water. If we are essentially made of water, and surrounded by water, why do we still need to drink so much? Well, each day we lose two to three liters through our sweat, urine, and bowel movements, and even just from breathing. While these functions are essential to our survival, we need to compensate for the fluid loss. Maintaining a balanced water level is essential to avoid dehydration or over-hydration, both of which can have devastating effects on overall health. At first detection of low water levels, sensory receptors in the brain's hypothalamus signal the release  of antidiuretic hormone. When it reached the kidneys,  it creates aquaporins, special channels that enable blood to absorb and retain more water, leading to concentrated, dark urine. Increased dehydration can cause notable drops in energy, mood, skin moisture, and blood pressure, as well as signs of cognitive impairment. A dehydrated brain works harder to accomplish the same amount as a normal brain, and it even temporarily shrinks because of its lack of water. Over-hydration, or hyponatremia, is usually caused by overconsumption of water in a short amount of time. Athletes are often the victims  of over-hydration because of complications in regulating water levels in extreme physical conditions. Whereas the dehydrated brain amps up the production of antidiuretic hormone, the over-hydrated brain slows, or even stops, releasing it into the blood. Sodium electrolytes in the body become diluted, causing cells to swell. In severe cases, the kidneys can't keep up with the resulting volumes of dilute urine. Water intoxication then occurs, possibly causing headache, vomiting, and, in rare instances, seizures or death. But that's a pretty extreme situation. On a normal, day-to-day basis, maintaining a well-hydrated system is easy to manage for those of us fortunate enough  to have access to clean drinking water. For a long time, conventional wisdom said that we should drink eight glasses a day. That estimate has since been fine-tuned. Now, the consensus is that the amount of water we need to imbibe depends largely on our weight and environment. The recommended daily intake varies from between 2.5-3.7 liters of water for men, and about 2-2.7 liters for women, a range that is pushed up  or down if we are healthy, active, old, or overheating. While water is the healthiest hydrator, other beverages, even those with caffeine  like coffee or tea, replenish fluids as well. And water within food makes up  about a fifth of our daily H20 intake. Fruits and vegetables like strawberries, cucumbers, and even broccoli are over 90% water, and can supplement liquid intake while providing valuable nutrients and fiber. Drinking well might also have various long-term benefits. Studies have shown that optimal hydration can lower the chance of stroke, help manage diabetes, and potentially reduce the risk of certain types of cancer. No matter what, getting the right amount of liquid makes a world of difference in how you'll feel, think, and function day to day. "
273,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,9p5Oi4wPVVo,"How do we explain the unexplainable? This question has inspired numerous myths, religious practices, and scientific inquiries. But Zen Buddhists practicing throughout  China from the 9th to 13th century asked a different question – why do we need an explanation? For these monks, blindly seeking answers  was a vice to overcome, and learning to accept the mysteries of existence was the true path to enlightenment. But fighting the urge to explain the unexplainable can be difficult. So to help practice living with these mysteries, the meditating monks used a collection of roughly 1,700 bewildering and ambiguous philosophical thought experiments called kōans. The name, originally gong-an in Chinese, translates to “public record or case."" But unlike real-world court cases, kōans were intentionally incomprehensible. They were surprising, surreal, and frequently contradicted themselves. On the surface, they contained a proverb about the Zen Buddhist monastic code - such as living without physical or mental attachments, avoiding binary thinking, and realizing one’s true “Buddha-nature."" But by framing those lessons as illogical anecdotes, they became tests to help practicing monks learn to live with ambiguity and paradox. By puzzling through these confusing “cases,"" meditating monks could both internalize and practice Buddhist teachings. Hopefully, they would let go of the search for one true answer and trigger a spiritual breakthrough. Since these are intentionally  unexplainable, it would be misguided to try and decipher these stories ourselves. But like the monks before us, we can puzzle over them together, and investigate just how resistant they are to simple explanations. Consider this kōan illustrating the practice of no-attachment. Two monks, Tanzan and Ekido, are traveling together down a muddy road. Ahead they see an attractive traveler, unable to cross the muddy path. Tanzan politely offers his help, carrying the traveler  on his back across the street, and placing her down without a word. Ekido was shocked. According to monastic law, monks were not supposed to go near women, let alone touch a beautiful stranger. After miles of walking, Ekido could no longer restrain himself. “How could you carry that woman?” Tanzan smiled, “I left the traveler there. Are you still carrying her?” Like all kōans,  this story has numerous interpretations. But one popular reading suggests that despite never having physically carried the traveler, Ekido broke monastic law by mentally ""clinging to"" the woman. This type of conflict – examining the grey area between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law – was common in kōans. In addition to exploring ambiguity, kōans often ridiculed characters claiming total understanding  of the world around them. One such example finds three monks debating a temple flag  rippling in the wind. The first monk refers to  the flag as a moving banner, while the second monk insists  that they are not seeing the flag move, but rather the wind blowing. They argue back and forth, until finally, a third monk intervenes, “It is not the flag moving, nor the wind blowing, but rather the movement of your minds!” One interpretation of this kōan plays on the supposed wisdom of the arguing monks – the first asserting the importance of the observable world, the second favoring deeper knowledge we can infer from that world. But each monk’s commitment  to his own “answer” blinds him to the other’s insight,  and in doing so, defies an essential Buddhist ideal: abolishing binary thinking. The third monk identifies  their conflict as a perceptual one – both arguing monks  fail to see the larger picture. Of course, all these interpretations only hint at how to wrestle with these kōans. Neither the wisdom from practicing monks before us, nor the supposedly wise characters in these stories can resolve them for you. That’s because the purpose of these kōans isn’t reaching a simple solution. It’s the very act of struggling  with these paradoxical puzzles which challenge our desire for resolution, and our understanding of understanding itself. "
274,Education,27,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,9vuqI2v2IRs,"If someone were to show you these album covers, or these posters... Even if you've never heard of the bands featured, you’d probably be able to guess what kind of music they play. This style has become synonymous with the psychedelic '60s. But these abstract forms, and curly, barely legible lettering — they weren’t created in the 1960s. They came from a celebrated art movement — one that started almost a century earlier. In the late 1800s, new technology — electrical power, telephones, cars — was changing the way the world worked. And the way it looked. And some people, especially artists, living through this technological revolution were... not so into all the new industry. To be blunt, they thought it was ugly. Out of this conflict, a new global artistic movement was born One that went by many different names. Like the Secessionists in Austria and the Glasgow school in Scotland. But you might know it as: Art Nouveau, which literally means “new art” in French. Its creators wanted to make art that reflected the vibrancy of city life. They used flat, decorative patterns, feminine figures, and organic and plant motifs, often stylized with fluid, abstract forms. And they applied this new visual language to just about everything - from architecture to paintings to textiles and beyond. Because they believed that aesthetics should go hand in hand with utility. And no object was too mundane to be beautiful. Like this entrance to the Paris subway. Or these posters by Alphonse Mucha - advertising champagne and biscuits which are just as much about being beautiful as they are about conveying information. Okay, back to the hippies. Like the late 1800s, the 1960s were a time of cultural upheaval. ARCHIVE: “The Vietnam struggle goes on” ARCHIVE: “We want the Beatles” ARCHIVE: “The Beatles everybody” In the US, the epicenter of this change was San Francisco, where hundreds of thousands of young people descended upon the city. For things like protests, and drum circles, and of course, concerts. Lots and lots and lots of concerts. Particularly dance concerts, featuring trippy, psychedelic music from bands like Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead. And there was one major way to get people to come to your concert: A good poster. Back then, these now iconic bands were just starting out, playing back to back shows at venues like the Fillmore and the Avalon And to advertise this new generation of hippie bands, those venues knew that plain typeface and a grayscale photo just wasn’t going to cut it. So they commissioned work from a small group of artists, who developed a brand-new formula for concert posters. One that pulled from a variety of established design traditions - comic books, surrealism, and, of course, art nouveau. By the mid-60s, art nouveau was already experiencing a bit of a resurgence. Especially when it came to textiles - dynamic, floral designs were a natural fit for the hippie aesthetic. Which is probably why in 1965, a museum just outside of San Francisco launched this exhibit. Legend says this is where some of those designers were first exposed to Art Nouveau. One designer, Wes Wilson, told Time Magazine that he admired their “idea of really putting it out there.” And when they started making new concert posters, these designers took those art nouveau staples — and turned the dial up. Art nouveau is famous for its feminine figures - most often nude, with flowing hair, and a “come hither” glance. A style the psychedelic designers clearly picked up on. Look at the way these posters are covered edge to edge with detailed, two dimensional illustrations. Particularly flowers, and abstract curves, And, also peacocks - that’s an art nouveau thing, too. They… loved peacocks And sometimes, psychedelic designers would use images pulled directly from an art nouveau poster — but always with a radically different color palette. Instead of art nouveau’s soft pastels. psychedelic artists opted for intense, high-contrast colors, said to make your eyes “vibrate”; a reference to the “visual experiences of an LSD tripper.” And that curly, cloudy, barely legible font? It started here… on a 1902 poster by Austrian designer Alfred Roller. In the 60s, artists adapted the bold, dynamic typeface and pushed it even further - softening its lines and obscuring its edges. Making it nearly illegible. Which served a purpose. It was meant to grab your attention and keep you interested - at least for as long as it took to figure out what the poster was trying to tell you. The result was a ton of posters that looked like art nouveau on acid. As the music of San Francisco spread throughout the world, so did the aesthetic. In part because posters are easy to own and reproduce and collect. With fans sometimes tearing them down immediately after they were put up. The artists behind them even became celebrities in their own right - a few of them got their own spread in Life Magazine. The posters they made — their vibrating colors and winding lines — capture the energy of the 1960s. Just like the art nouveau ones represent the late 1800s. And while these two time periods don’t mirror each other perfectly, both movements were able to create something that captured the feeling of a changing world. And their art reflected that. "
275,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,A-QgGXbDyR0,"Around 1159 A.D., a mathematician called  Bhaskara the Learned sketched a design for a wheel containing curved reservoirs of mercury. He reasoned that as the wheels spun, the mercury would flow to the bottom of each reservoir, leaving one side of the wheel perpetually heavier than the other. The imbalance would keep the wheel turning forever. Bhaskara's drawing was one of the earliest designs for a perpetual motion machine, a device that can do work indefinitely without any external energy source. Imagine a windmill that produced the breeze it needed to keep rotating. Or a lightbulb whose glow provided its own electricity. These devices have captured many inventors' imaginations because they could transform  our relationship with energy. For example, if you could build  a perpetual motion machine that included humans as part of its perfectly efficient system, it could sustain life indefinitely. There's just one problem. They don't work. Ideas for perpetual motion machines all violate one or more fundamental laws of thermodynamics, the branch of physics that describes the relationship between different forms of energy. The first law of thermodynamics says that energy can't be created or destroyed. You can't get out more energy than you put in. That rules out a useful perpetual motion machine right away because a machine could only ever produce as much energy as it consumed. There wouldn't be any left over to power a car or charge a phone. But what if you just wanted the machine to keep itself moving? Inventors have proposed plenty of ideas. Several of these have been variations on Bhaskara's over-balanced wheel with rolling balls  or weights on swinging arms. None of them work. The moving parts that make one side of the wheel heavier also shift its center of mass downward below the axle. With a low center of mass, the wheel just swings back and forth like a pendulum, then stops. What about a different approach? In the 17th century, Robert Boyle came up with an idea for a self-watering pot. He theorized that capillary action, the attraction  between liquids and surfaces that pulls water through thin tubes, might keep the water cycling around the bowl. But if the capillary action is strong enough to overcome gravity and draw the water up, it would also prevent it from falling back into the bowl. Then there are versions with magnets, like this set of ramps. The ball is supposed to be pulled upwards by the magnet at the top, fall back down through the hole, and repeat the cycle. This one fails because like the self-watering pot, the magnet would simply hold the ball at the top. Even if it somehow did keep moving, the magnet's strength would degrade over time and eventually stop working. For each of these machines to keep moving, they'd have to create some extra energy to nudge the system past its stopping point, breaking the first law of thermodynamics. There are ones that seem to keep going, but in reality, they invariably turn out to be drawing energy from some external source. Even if engineers could somehow design a machine that didn't violate the first law of thermodynamics, it still wouldn't work in the real world because of the second law. The second law of thermodynamics tells us that energy tends to spread out through processes like friction. Any real machine would have moving parts or interactions with air  or liquid molecules that would generate tiny amounts of friction and heat, even in a vacuum. That heat is energy escaping, and it would keep leeching out, reducing the energy available to move the system itself until the machine inevitably stopped. So far, these two laws of thermodynamics have stymied every idea for perpetual motion and the dreams of perfectly efficient energy generation they imply. Yet it's hard to conclusively say we'll never discover a perpetual motion machine because there's still so much we don't understand about the universe. Perhaps we'll find  new exotic forms of matter that'll force us to revisit the laws of thermodynamics. Or maybe there's perpetual motion on tiny quantum scales. What we can be reasonably sure about is that we'll never stop looking. For now, the one thing that seems truly perpetual is our search. "
276,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,A9fQPzZ1-hg,"In the early hours of August 13, 1961, East German construction workers flanked by soldiers and police began tearing up streets and erecting barriers throughout the city of Berlin and its surroundings. This night marked the beginning of one of history's most infamous dividing lines, the Berlin Wall. Construction on the wall continued for the next decade as it cut through neighborhoods, separated families, and divided not just Germany, but the world. To understand how we got to this point, we have to go back to World War II. America, Britain, and France joined forces with the Soviet Union against the Axis Powers. After they defeated Nazi Germany, each of the victorious nations occupied part of the country. The division was meant to be temporary, but the former allies found themselves at odds over their visions for post-war Europe. While Western powers promoted liberal market economies, the Soviet Union sought to surround itself with obedient Communist nations, including a weakened Germany. As their relations deteriorated, the Federal Republic of Germany was formed in the West while the Soviets established the German Democratic Republic in the East. The Soviet satellite countries restricted Western trade and movement, so a virtually impassable border formed. It became known as the Iron Curtain. In the former German capital of Berlin, things were particularly complicated. Although the city lay fully within the East German territory of the GDR, the post-war agreement gave the allies joint administration. So America, Britain, and France created a Democratic enclave in Berlin's western districts. While East Germans were officially banned from leaving the country, in Berlin, it was simply  a matter of walking, or riding a subway, streetcar or bus, to the Western half, then traveling on to West Germany or beyond. This open border posed a problem for the East German leadership. They had staked a claim to represent the Communist resistance against Hitler and portrayed Western Germany as a continuation of the Nazi regime. While the U.S. and its allies poured money into West Germany's reconstruction, the Soviet Union extracted resources from the East as war reparations, making its planned economy even less competitive. Life in East Germany passed under the watchful eye of the Stasi, the secret police whose wiretaps and informants monitored citizens for any hint of disloyalty. While there was free health care and education in the East, the West boasted higher salaries, more consumer goods, and greater personal freedom. By 1961, about 3.5 million people, nearly 20% of the East German population, had left, including many young professionals. To prevent further losses, East Germany decided to close the border, and that's where the Berlin Wall came in. Extending for 43 kilometers through Berlin, and a further 112 through East Germany, the initial barrier consisted of barbed wire and mesh fencing. Some Berliners escaped by jumping over the wire or leaving from windows, but as the wall expanded, this became more difficult. By 1965, 106 kilometers of 3.6-meter-high concrete barricades had been added topped with a smooth  pipe to prevent climbing. Over the coming years, the barrier was strengthened with spike strips, guard dogs, and even landmines, along with 302 watchtowers and 20 bunkers. A parallel fence in the rear set off a 100-meter area called the death strip. There, all buildings were demolished and the ground covered with sand to provide a clear line of sight for the hundreds of guards ordered to shoot anyone  attempting to cross. Nevertheless, nearly 5,000 people in total managed to flee East Germany between 1961 and 1989. Some were diplomats or athletes who defected while abroad, but others were ordinary citizens who dug tunnels, swam across canals, flew hot air balloons, or even crashed a stolen tank through the wall. Yet the risk was great. Over 138 people died while attempting escape. Some shot in full view of West Germans powerless to help them. The wall stabilized East Germany's economy by preventing its work force from leaving, but tarnished its reputation, becoming a global symbol  of Communist repression. As part of reconciliation with the East, the Basic Treaty of 1972 recognized East Germany pragmatically while West Germany retained its hope for eventual reunification. Although the Eastern regime gradually allowed family visits, it tried to discourage people from exercising these rights with an arduous bureaucratic process and high fees. Nonetheless, it was still overwhelmed by applications. By the end of the 1980's, the liberalization of  other Eastern Bloc regimes caused mass demonstrations for free travel and demands for democracy. On the evening of November 9, 1989, East Germany tried to defuse tension by making travel permits easier to obtain. But the announcement brought thousands of East Berliners to the border crossing points in the wall, forcing the surprised guards to open the gates immediately. Rejoicing crowds poured into West Berlin as people from both sides danced  atop the wall. And others began to demolish it  with whatever tools they could find. Although the border guards initially tried to maintain order, it was soon clear that the years of division were at an end. After four decades, Germany was officially reunified in October 1990. And the Soviet Union fell soon after. Today, parts of the wall still stand as a reminder that any barriers we put up  to impede freedom, we can also break down. "

To escape the inferno, they must cross over to the left bank of a crocodile-infested river. Fortunately, there happens to be a raft nearby. It can carry up to two animals at a time, and needs as least one lion or wildebeest on board to row it across the river. There's just one problem. If the lions ever outnumber the wildebeest on either side of the river, even for a moment, their instincts will kick in, and the results won't be pretty. That includes the animals in the boat when it's on a given side of the river. What's the fastest way for all six animals to get across without the lions stopping for dinner? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If you feel stuck on a problem like this, try listing all the decisions you can make at each point, and the consequences each choice leads to. For instance, there are five options for who goes across first: one wildebeest, one lion, two wildebeest, two lions, or one of each. If one animal goes alone, it'll just have to come straight back. And if two wildebeest cross first, the remaining one will immediately get eaten. So those options are all out. Sending two lions, or one of each animal, can actually both lead to solutions in the same number of moves. For the sake of time, we'll focus on the second one. One of each animal crosses. Now, if the wildebeest stays  and the lion returns, there will be three lions on the right bank. Bad news for the two remaining wildebeest. So we need to have the lion stay on the left bank and the wildebeest go back to the right. Now we have the same five options, but with one lion  already on the left bank. If two wildebeest go, the one that stays will get eaten, and if one of each animal goes, the wildebeest on the raft will be outnumbered as soon as it reaches the other side. So that's a dead end, which means that at the third crossing, only the two lions can go. One gets dropped off, leaving two lions on the left bank. The third lion takes the raft back to the right bank where the wildebeest are waiting. What now? Well, since we've got two lions waiting on the left bank, the only option is for two wildebeest to cross. Next, there's no sense in two wildebeest going back, since that just reverses the last step. And if two lions go back, they'll outnumber the wildebeest on the right bank. So one lion and one wildebeest take the raft back leaving us with one of each animal on the left bank and two of each on the right. Again, there's no point in sending the lion-wildebeest pair back, so the next trip should be either a pair of lions or a pair of wildebeest. If the lions go, they'd eat the wildebeest on the left, so they stay, and the two wildebeest cross instead. Now we're quite close because the wildebeest are all where they need to be with safety in numbers. All that's left is for that one lion to raft back and bring his fellow lions over one by one. That makes eleven trips total, the smallest number needed to get everyone across safely. The solution that involves sending both lions on the first step works similarly, and also takes eleven crossings. The six animals escape unharmed from the fire just in time and begin their new lives  across the river. Of course, now that the danger's passed, it remains to be seen how long their unlikely alliance will last. "
278,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,AcmarVpo2xE,"In 1982, a young nurse was suffering from severe, unrelenting depression. She couldn’t work, socialize, or even concentrate well enough to read the newspaper. One treatment changed everything. After two courses of electroconvulsive therapy, or ECT, her symptoms lifted. She went back to work, then on to graduate school, where she earned high grades. At first, she talked openly about her life changing treatment. But as she realized many people had an extremely negative impression of ECT, she stopped sharing her experience. ECT carried a deep stigma, leftover from a history that bears little resemblance to the modern procedure. The therapy was first used in medicine in 1938. In its early years, doctors administered a strong electrical current to the brain, causing a whole-body seizure during which patients might bite their tongues or even break bones. Modern ECT is very different. While a patient is under  general anesthesia, electrodes deliver a series of mild electrical pulses to the brain. This causes huge numbers of neurons to fire in unison: a brief, controlled seizure. A muscle relaxant keeps spasms from spreading to the rest of his body. The only physical indication of the electricity flooding the brain is a twitching foot. The treatment lasts for about a minute, and most patients are able to resume normal activities about an hour after each session. ECT is commonly used to treat severe cases of major depression or bipolar disorder in patients who haven’t responded to other therapies, or who have had adverse  reactions to medication. Half or more of those who undergo  treatment experience an improvement in their symptoms. Most patients treated with ECT have two or three sessions per week for several weeks. Some begin to notice an improvement in their symptoms after just one session, while others take longer to respond. Patients often continue less frequent treatments for several months to a year, and some need occasional maintenance sessions for the rest of their lives. Modern ECT is much safer than it used to be, but patients can still experience side effects. They may feel achy, fatigued, or nauseated right after treatment. Some have trouble remembering what happened right before a session— for example, what they had for dinner the previous evening. Rarely, they might have trouble remembering up to weeks and months before. For most patients, this memory loss does improve over time. What's fascinating is that despite its proven track record, we still don't know exactly why ECT works. Neurons in the brain communicate via electrical signals, which influence our brain chemistry,  contributing to mood and behavior. The flood of electrical activity sparked by ECT alters that chemistry. For example, ECT triggers the release of certain neurotransmitters, molecules that help carry signals between neurons and influence mental health. ECT also stimulates the flow of hormones that may help reduce symptoms of depression. Interestingly, ECT maintenance works better when paired with medication, even in patients who were resistant to medication before. As we come to a better  understanding of the brain, we’ll likely be able to make  ECT even more effective. In 1995, more than a decade after her first course of ECT, the nurse decided to publish an account of her experience. Because of the stigma surrounding the treatment, she worried that doing so might negatively impact her personal and professional life, but she knew ECT could make a difference for patients when all else failed. Though misperceptions about ECT persist, accounts like hers have helped make doctors and patients alike aware of the treatment’s  life changing potential. "
279,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,B2zhLYz4pYo,"One day in 1965, while driving to Acapulco for a vacation with his family, Colombian journalist Gabriel García  Márquez abruptly turned his car around, asked his wife to take care of the family’s finances for the coming months, and returned home. The beginning of a new book  had suddenly come to him: “Many years later,  as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to remember  that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice.” Over the next eighteen months, those words would blossom  into One Hundred Years of Solitude. A novel that would go on  to bring Latin American literature to the forefront of the global imagination, earning García Márquez the 1982 Nobel Prize for Literature. What makes One Hundred Years of Solitude so remarkable? The novel chronicles the fortunes and misfortunes of the Buendía family  over seven generations. With its lush, detailed sentences, large cast of characters, and tangled narrative, One Hundred Years of Solitude is not an easy book to read. But it’s a deeply rewarding one, with an epic assortment  of intense romances, civil war, political intrigue, globe-trotting adventurers, and more characters named Aureliano than you’d think possible. Yet this is no mere historical drama. One Hundred Years of Solitude  is one of the most famous examples of a literary genre  known as magical realism. Here, supernatural events or abilities are described in a realistic and matter-of-fact tone, while the real events of human life  and history reveal themselves  to be full of fantastical absurdity. Surreal phenomena within the fictional village of Macondo intertwine seamlessly with events taking place in the real country of Colombia. The settlement begins  in a mythical state of isolation, but is gradually exposed  to the outside world, facing multiple calamities along the way. As years pass, characters grow old and die, only to return as ghosts, or to be seemingly reincarnated  in the next generation. When the American fruit company  comes to town, so does a romantic mechanic who is always followed by yellow butterflies. A young woman up and floats away. Although the novel moves forward through subsequent generations, time moves in an almost cyclical manner. Many characters have similar names  and features to their forebears, whose mistakes they often repeat. Strange prophecies and visits from mysterious gypsies give way to the skirmishes and firing squads of repeated civil wars. An American fruit company opens a plantation near the village and ends up massacring thousands of striking workers, mirroring the real-life  ‘Banana Massacre’ of 1928. Combined with the novel’s magical realism, this produces a sense of history as a downward spiral the characters seem powerless to escape. Beneath the magic is a story  about the pattern of Colombian and Latin American history  from colonial times onward. This is a history that the author experienced firsthand. Gabriel García Márquez grew up in a Colombia torn apart by civil conflict between its Conservative and Liberal political parties. He also lived in an autocratic Mexico and covered the 1958 Venezuelan  coup d’état as a journalist. But perhaps his biggest influences  were his maternal grandparents. Nicolás Ricardo Márquez was a decorated veteran of the Thousand Days War whose accounts of the rebellion against Colombia's conservative government led Gabriel García Márquez  to a socialist outlook. Meanwhile, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes’ omnipresent superstition became the foundation  of One Hundred Years of Solitude’s style. Their small house in Aracataca  where the author spent his childhood formed the main inspiration for Macondo. With One Hundred Years of Solitude, Gabriel García Márquez  found a unique way to capture the unique history of Latin America. He was able to depict the strange reality of living in a post-colonial society, forced to relive the tragedies of the past. In spite of all this fatalism, the novel still holds hope. At his Nobel Lecture, García Marquez reflected on Latin America’s long history of civil strife and rampant iniquity. Yet he ended the speech by affirming the possibility of building a better world, to quote, “where no one will be able to decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned  to one hundred years of solitude will have, at last and forever, a second chance on earth.""

280,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,BIP0lYrdirI,"The discovery of the structure of DNA was one of the most important scientific achievements in the last century, in human history, in fact. The now-famous double helix is almost synonymous with Watson and Crick, two of the scientists who won the Nobel Prize for figuring it out. But there's another name  you may know, too, Rosalind Franklin. You may have heard that her data supported Watson and Crick's brilliant idea, or that she was a plain-dressing, belligerent scientist, which is how Watson actually described her in ""The Double Helix."" But thanks to Franklin's biographers, who investigated her life and interviewed many people close to her, we now know that that account is far from true, and her scientific contributions have been vastly underplayed. Let's hear the real story. Rosalind Elsie Franklin was born in London in 1920. She wanted to be a scientist ever since she was a teenager, which wasn't a common or easy career path for girls at that time. But she excelled at science anyway. She won a scholarship to Cambridge to study chemistry, where she earned her Ph.D., and she later conducted research on the structure of coal that led to better gas masks for  the British during World War II. In 1951, she joined King's College to use x-ray techniques to study the structure of DNA, then one of the hottest topics in science. Franklin upgraded the x-ray lab and got to work shining high-energy x-rays on tiny, wet crystals of DNA. But the acadmemic culture at the time wasn't very friendly to women, and Franklin was isolated  from her colleagues. She clashed with Maurice Wilkins, a labmate who assumed Franklin had been hired as his assistant. But Franklin kept working, and in 1952, she obtained Photo 51, the most famous x-ray image of DNA. Just getting the image took 100 hours, the calculations necessary to analyze it would take a year. Meanwhile, the American biologist James Watson and the British physicist Francis Crick were also working on finding DNA's structure. Without Franklin's knowledge, Wilkins took Photo 51 and showed it to Watson and Crick. Instead of calculating the exact position of every atom, they did a quick analysis  of Franklin's data and used that to build  a few potential structures. Eventually, they arrived at the right one. DNA is made of two helicoidal strands, one opposite the other with bases in the center like rungs of a ladder. Watson and Crick published their model in April 1953. Meanwhile,  Franklin had finished her calculations, come to the same conclusion, and submitted her own manuscript. The journal published  the manuscripts together, but put Franklin's last, making it look like her experiments just confirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough instead of inspiring it. But Franklin had already  stopped working on DNA and died of cancer in 1958, never knowing that Watson and Crick had seen her photographs. Watson, Crick, and Wilkins won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA. It's often said that Franklin would have been recognized by a Nobel Prize if only they could be  awarded posthumously. And, in fact, it's possible she could have won twice. Her work on the structure of viruses led to a Nobel for a colleague in 1982. It's time to tell the story of a brave woman who fought sexism in science, and whose work revolutionized medicine, biology, and agriculture. It's time to honor  Rosalind Elsie Franklin, the unsung mother of the double helix. "

But there’s a problem – the elder giant’s favorite  shirt is wrinkled! To fix it, you’ll need to power up… the Giant Iron. The iron needs two giant batteries to work. You just had 4 working ones and 4 dead ones in separate piles, but it looks like the baby giant mixed them all up. You need to get the iron working and press the giant shirt, fast – or you’ll end up being the main course tonight! How can you test the batteries so that you’re guaranteed to get  a working pair in 7 tries or less? Pause the video now if you want to  figure it out for yourself Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 You could, of course, take  all eight batteries and begin testing the 28  possible combinations. You might get lucky within the first few tries. But if you don’t, moving the giant batteries that many times will take way too long. You can’t rely on luck – you need to assume the worst  possibility and plan accordingly. However, you don’t actually need  to test every possible combination. Remember – there are four  good batteries in total, meaning that any pile of six you choose will have at least two good batteries in it. That doesn’t help you right away, since testing all six batteries could  still take as many as 15 tries. But it does give you  a clue to the solution – dividing the batteries into smaller  subsets narrows down the possible results. So instead of six batteries, let’s take any three. This group has a total of three  possible combinations. Since both batteries have to be  working for the iron to power up, a single failure can’t tell you whether  both batteries are dead, or just one. But if all three combinations fail, then you’ll know this group has either one good battery, or none at all. Now you can set those three aside and repeat the process for  another three batteries. You might get a match, but if every  combination fails again, you’ll know this set can have  no more than one good battery. That would leave only two  batteries untried. Since there are four good batteries in total and you’ve only accounted for two so far, both of these remaining ones must be good. Dividing the batteries into sets of 3, 3, and 2 is guaranteed to get a working result  in 7 tries or less, no matter what order  you test the piles in. With no time to spare, the iron comes to life, and you manage to get the shirt  flawlessly ironed. The pleased elder and his family show up  to the party dressed to the nines … well, almost. "
282,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,BZLGKFWlRzY," Welcome to a new series of Extra History. Before we start, I've got two announcements. Thanks to all of you who supported us on Patreon, Extra History is now officially a weekly show. New episodes will come out every Saturday from here on, and to help us do that, We've got a new team member. Allow me to introduce Heather McNabb. She and David will be trading off every series. I'm excited. Let's get started. For the next few weeks, we'll be covering the Zulu Empire: its rise, its fall, and its famous fight against the British. We'll see a small tribe become an Empire. We'll see European factions playing out the game of power on South African shores, and we'll see a late post-Napoleonic army, well drilled and equipped with modern rifles, be beaten by an indigenous population wielding nothing more than spears and hide shields, but before we can do so we need to talk about sources. There's a lot about this period that we just don't know. It's not like the Sengoku Jidai where it's simply hard to find the translations of the more obscure records. In this case we're dealing with a culture that didn't keep written records, so all we have to go on are scant accounts from European traders and oral histories collected decades after the fact. Much of what we're going to tell you, especially about the early period we're covering, are best guesses by the historians and archaeologists who have worked tirelessly to piece together the puzzle of exactly what transformed the Zulus, a tribe perhaps as small as 1,500 people living in an area of probably around 10 square miles, into an empire of 250,000 people, ruling over an area roughly the size of New Jersey. So, with that caveat, let's start laying out the background. Who were the Zulu people when this all began? What did life look like for them? How did they subsist? What was their government, their economy, their military? Well, they were a relatively minor tribe within the larger Bantu people who occupied a region in what would now be the Eastern part of South Africa. They had a largely pastoral economy with wealth being measured in cattle and the population mostly subsisting on maize and milk. They operated under a kingship, but they had very little in the way of what we would consider centralized governance. And war? Well when our story begins, somewhere in the end of the 18th century, warfare in this region was more of a ritual affair than a destructive endeavor. Warriors would meet at a predetermined location and fling spears and insults at one another but would rarely move in for close quarters fighting. This left the casualties very light, and it was almost unheard of for the winning side to follow up a victory by chasing down their opponents or sacking or conquering their land. Instead, battles would result in the transfer of a small amount of territory, or some cattle. But Shaka, who will be the central figure in the early part of our story, changed all this. He changed the weapons, the tactics, and perhaps most importantly, the philosophy of war in the region. He brought in close quarters combat, replacing the traditional long throwing spear with a shorter thrusting spear that was devastating when used in a melee. He developed a system of envelopment tactics known as the bullhorn formation, which I'll explain in more detail later. And he changed war from a means of settling minor disputes to an activity of slaughter and conquest. So who was Shaka? Shaka was the eldest son of the leader of the Zulu people. But he was considered illegitimate, and so wasn't named the heir to the Zulu kingdom. In fact his name, Shaka, means intestinal beetle, which was sort of the cover story for his mother's untimely pregnancy. This becomes kind of hilarious when you realize that we in the West often call him Shaka Zulu, and since the word Zulu actually means heaven in the Zulu language, we're basically calling him Intestinal Beetle Heaven, so enjoy that. Anyway, at the age of 7, because of his illegitimacy, Shaka was sent to live with his mother among the Elangeni, a neighboring tribe. From there he moved on to the Mtethwa, the most powerful tribe in the region, where he served as a warrior, first for a man named Jobe, and then for Jobe's successor, a man named Dingiswayo. Dingiswayo took notice of Shaka's unusual prowess as a close combat fighter, and when he discovered that Shaka was actually of Royal blood, put him in charge of an Ibuto, which you can basically think of as a regiment. And it's here that Shaka really began to refine his tactics. The traditional Ibuto were armed with long throwing spears and while they practiced the use of their weapons, they didn't do much in terms of practicing unit tactics. Generally, they would show up to the battlefield as more of a loose mob than a cohesive fighting unit. But Shaka began to experiment with this. He armed his men with the short stabbing spear and drilled them in a tactic that he called The Bullhorn. He'd split his men into three groups: the chest, the horns, and the loins. The chest would charge the enemy and pin them in hand-to-hand combat. Then the two branches of the horns, positioned to either side of the chest, would flank and envelop the pinned enemy. This whole time the loins would sit behind the lines acting as a rested reserve to be applied where needed. Interestingly it's been said that Shaka would have these men sit with their backs to the fighting so they wouldn't become panicked or charge over eagerly before he needed them. The brilliance of this system was that it was simple. Without much battlefield coordination, every man knew what he was supposed to do. If you're in the chest you charge. If you're in the horns you get around Their flank. The system's simplicity meant that it could be applied in chaotic conditions without much of the signalling that was required by modern armies. With these deadly new weapons and tactics, Shaka became a force to be reckoned with, and when his father died he decided it was time to take his own. Shaka's half-brother, the legitimate heir, took the Zulu throne. But with the help of Dingiswayo, Shaka quickly had him assassinated and simply moved in to take over the place. Dingiswayo was still the chief of the Zulus, so Shaka continued to serve him, but only a year later, Dingiswayo was killed by a man named Zwide, the ruler of the Ndwandwe. One of the most powerful tribes in the region. Shaka vowed vengeance for his leaders death and stepped in to fill the void Dingiswayo had left behind. Bringing the Mthetwa and with them many of the other local tribes under his control. Shaka's vengeance and the war he was about to bring would lead to a period of unparalleled chaos and devestation. In Zulu, they call it the Mefecane, In English, we simply call it The Crushing. But before we delve into The Crushing, we should talk about why war here became genocide. And why the region was so primed to explode at the first signs of strife. A lot of it has to do with European influence, not because Europeans tried to cause it, in fact there were many Europeans who tried to help, but given how radically different, how wealthy, how technologically separated the Europeans were from the local population, their mere presence dramatically destabilized the region. As European trade increased, new crops were introduced, which led to a population increase, which in turn led to greater competition for land. Meanwhile, European ships would trade for cattle to resupply their food stores, which made cattle even more valuable and led to an increase in raiding. At the same time, European traders also came looking for ivory, and to get Ivory, you have to take down elephants. Which requires a large degree of coordination from a group of people. Which some have said led to the more coordinated and far more deadly tactics that Shaka was able to implement. To add to all of this, a drought caused the more water-hungry European crops to fail, which led to a famine. So the area, Natal, was already primed for disaster. Join us next week as we explore Shaka's quest for vengeance, see his descent into madness, and witness the horrors of The Crushing. "
283,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,BvLolPN8NvU,"A whip-like straw. Powerful, crushing blades. A pointed, piercing tube. There are nearly a million  known insect species in the world, but most have one of just  five common types of mouthparts. And that’s extremely useful to scientists because when they encounter an unfamiliar insect in the wild, they can learn a lot about it just by examining how it eats. Scientific classification, or taxonomy, is used to organize all  living things into seven levels: kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. The features of an insect’s mouthparts can help identify which order it belongs to, while also providing clues about how it evolved and what it feeds on. The chewing mouthpart is the most common. It’s also the most primitive— all other mouthparts are thought to have started out looking like this one before evolving into something different. It features a pair  of jaws called mandibles with toothed inner edges that cut up  and crush solid foods, like leaves or other insects. You can find this mouthpart on ants from the Hymenoptera order, grasshoppers and crickets of the Orthoptera order, dragonflies of the Odonata order, and beetles of the Coleoptera order. The piercing-sucking mouthpart consists of a long, tube-like structure called a beak. This beak can pierce plant or animal tissue to suck up liquids like sap or blood. It can also secrete saliva  with digestive enzymes that liquefy food for easier sucking. Insects in the Hemiptera order have piercing-sucking mouthparts and include bed bugs, cicadas, aphids, and leafhoppers. The siphoning mouthpart, a friendlier version of the piercing and sucking beak, also consists of a long, tube-like structure called a proboscis that works like a straw to suck up nectar from flowers. Insects of the Lepidoptera order— butterflies and moths— keep their proboscises rolled up tightly beneath their heads when they’re not feeding and unfurl them when they come across some sweet nectar. With the sponging mouthpart, there’s yet another tube, this time ending in two spongy lobes that contain many finer  tubes called pseudotracheae. The pseudotracheae secrete  enzyme-filled saliva and soak up fluids and dissolved foods by capillary action. House flies, fruit flies, and the other non-biting  members of the Diptera order are the only insects that use this technique. But, there’s a catch. Biting flies within Diptera, like mosquitoes, horse flies, and deer flies, have a piercing-sucking mouthpart instead of the sponging mouthpart. And finally, the chewing-lapping mouthpart is a combination of mandibles and a proboscis with a tongue-like structure at its tip for lapping up nectar. On this type of mouthpart, the mandibles themselves  are not actually used for eating. For bees and wasps, members of the Hymenoptera order, they serve instead as tools for pollen-collecting and wax-molding. Of course, in nature, there are always exceptions to the rules. The juvenile stages of some insects,  for example, have completely different kinds  of mouths than their adult versions, like caterpillars, which use chewing  mouthparts to devour leaves before metamorphosing into butterflies and moths with siphoning mouthparts. Still, mouthpart identification can,  for the most part, help scientists—and you —categorize insects. So why not break out a magnifying lens and learn a little more about who’s nibbling your vegetable garden, biting your arm, or just flying by your ear. "
284,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,CVo225pUaSA,"Homer's ""Odyssey"", one of the oldest works  of Western literature, recounts the adventures  of the Greek hero Odysseus during his ten-year journey home from the Trojan War. Though some parts may be based on real events, the encounters with strange monsters, terrifying giants and powerful magicians are considered to be complete fiction. But might there be more to these myths than meets the eye? Let's look at one famous episode  from the poem. In the midst of their long voyage, Odysseus and his crew find themselves on the mysterious island of Aeaea. Starving and exhausted, some of the men stumble upon a palatial home where a stunning woman welcomes them inside for a sumptuous feast. Of course, this all turns out to be too good to be true. The woman, in fact,  is the nefarious sorceress Circe, and as soon as the soldiers have eaten their fill at her table, she turns them all into animals with a wave of her wand. Fortunately, one of the men escapes, finds Odysseus and tells him of the crew's plight. But as Odysseus rushes to save his men, he meets the messenger god, Hermes, who advises him to first consume a magical herb. Odysseus follows this advice, and when he finally encounters Circe, her spells have no effect on him, allowing him to defeat her and rescue his crew. Naturally, this story of witchcraft and animal transformations was dismissed as nothing more  than imagination for centuries. But in recent years, the many mentions of herbs and drugs throughout the passage have piqued the interest of scientists, leading some to suggest the myths might have been  fictional expressions of real experiences. The earliest versions of Homer's text say that Circe mixed baneful drugs into the food such that the crew might utterly forget their native land. As it happens, one of the plants growing in the Mediterranean region is an innocent sounding herb known as Jimson weed, whose effects include pronounced amnesia. The plant is also loaded with compounds that disrupt the vital neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. Such disruption can cause  vivid hallucinations, bizarre behaviors, and general difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality, just the sorts of things which might make people believe they've been turned into animals, which also suggests that Circe was no sorceress, but in fact a chemist who knew how to use local plants to great effect. But Jimson weed is only half the story. Unlike a lot of material in the Odyssey, the text about the herb that Hermes gives to Odysseus is unusually specific. Called moly by the gods, it's described as being found in a forest glen, black at the root and with a flower as white as milk. Like the rest of the Circe episode, moly was dismissed  as fictional invention for centuries. But in 1951, Russian pharmacologist Mikhail Mashkovsky discovered that villagers  in the Ural Mountains used a plant with a milk-white flower and a black root to stave off paralysis in children suffering from polio. The plant, called snowdrop, turned out to contain a compound called galantamine that prevented the disruption of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, making it effective in treating not only polio but other disease, such as Alzheimer's. At the 12th World Congress of Neurology, Doctors Andreas Plaitakis  and Roger Duvoisin first proposed that snowdrop was, in fact, the plant Hermes gave to Odysseus. Although there is not much direct evidence that people in Homer's day would have known about  its anti-hallucinatory effects, we do have a passage from 4th century Greek writer Theophrastus stating that moly  is used as an antidote against poisons. So, does this all mean that Odysseus, Circe, and other characters in the Odyssey were real? Not necessarily. But it does suggest that ancient stories may have more elements of truth to them than we previously thought. And as we learn more about the world around us, we may uncover some of the same knowledge hidden within the myths and legends of ages passed. "
285,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,CxC161GvMPc,"Imagine as a thought experiment that you live in a small village and depend on the local fish pond for food. You share the pond  with three other villagers. The pond starts off with a dozen fish, and the fish reproduce. For every two fish, there will be  one baby added each night. So, in order to maximize  your supply of food, how many fish should you catch each day? Take a moment to think about it. Assume baby fish grow  to full size immediately and that the pond begins at full capacity, and ignore factors like the sex of the fish you catch. The answer? One, and it's not just you. The best way to maximize  every villager's food supply is for each fisherman to take  just one fish each day. Here's how the math works. If each villager takes one fish, there will be eight fish left over night. Each pair of fish produces one baby, and the next day, the pond  will be fully restocked with twelve fish. If anyone takes more than one, the number of reproductive pairs drops, and the population  won't be able to bounce back. Eventually, the fish in the lake  will be gone, leaving all four villagers to starve. This fish pond is just one example of a classic problem called the tragedy of the commons. The phenomenon was first described  in a pamphlet by economist William Forster Lloyd in 1833 in a discussion of  the overgrazing of cattle on village common areas. More than 100 years later, ecologist Garrett Hardin revived the concept to describe what happens when many individuals all share a limited resource, like grazing land, fishing areas, living space, even clean air. Hardin argued that these situations pit short-term self-interest against the common good, and they end badly for everyone, resulting in overgrazing, overfishing, overpopulation, pollution, and other social  and environmental problems. The key feature of  a tragedy of the commons is that it provides an opportunity for an individual to benefit him or herself while spreading out any negative effects  across the larger population. To see what that means, let's revisit our fish pond. Each individual fisherman is motivated to take as many fish as he can for himself. Meanwhile, any decline  in fish reproduction is shared by the entire village. Anxious to avoid  losing out to his neighbors, a fisherman will conclude that it's in his best interest to take an extra fish, or two, or three. Unfortunately, this is the same conclusion reached by the other fisherman, and that's the tragedy. Optimizing for the self in the short term isn't optimal for anyone in the long term. That's a simplified example, but the tragedy of the commons plays out in the more complex systems of real life, too. The overuse of antibiotics has led to short-term gains in livestock production and in treating common illnesses, but it's also resulted in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which threaten the entire population. A coal-fired power plant produces cheap electricity for its customers and profits for its owners. These local benefits are helpful in the short term, but pollution from mining and burning coal is spread across the entire atmosphere and sticks around for thousands of years. There are other examples, too. Littering, water shortages, deforestation, traffic jams, even the purchase of bottled water. But human civilization has proven it's capable of doing something remarkable. We form social contracts, we make communal agreements, we elect governments, and we pass laws. All this to save our collective selves from our own individual impulses. It isn't easy, and we certainly don't get it right nearly all of the time. But humans at our best have shown that we can solve these problems and we can continue to do so if we remember Hardin's lesson. When the tragedy of the commons applies, what's good for all of us  is good for each of us. "

It was a time of victories and tragedies. But he remembered as a young man thinking that he had done so much right in those days. He'd had a sense of confidence and purpose in each great, romantic, momentous decision. And yet now, as an old man, so many of those decisions tasted of ash. He remembered returning home from his campaign in Belgrade to the bitter news that two of his sons had died. His infant and his eldest. He was left with only Mustafa. He wept, He raged. And then in that very same year, his favorite concubine bore him a new son. He had fallen in love with her, that fire haired concubine. Her name was Roxelana, and he loved her in a way that he'd never loved his wife. He remembered how passionately he felt. How passionately he still felt for that Polish slave that he would one day and make his queen. His joy was complete. His rule was one of unprecedented success, and he shared it with his dearest friend, the trusted confidant of his youth. And his love, the love of his life who he never would have met if he were not Sultan. His friend, Ibrahim, he continued to promote up the ranks until after the fall of Rhodes, Suleiman asked him to serve as Grand Vizier. Ibrahim protested and begged to not be promoted any more lest his life be in peril. But he had just laughed and assured his friend that no one would put him to death so long as he, Suleiman reigned. How could decisions made out of such love be wrong. And so there he was, the mightiest monarch of the mightiest empire of the modern world, ready to conquer life with his true love and his one true friend, faithfully by his side. His own sister married Ibrahim, and it was a night of splendor like the empire hadn't seen since the greatest monarchs of Rome. In his youth he'd never known family. But he knew one now. But trouble began to show for Ahmed Pasha, Second Vizier, had thought that he was going to be promoted to the post of Grand Vizier. He had worked and toiled and intrigued to see that the former Grand Vizier had been dismissed after Rhodes. But now seeing that Ibrahim had been appointed to the post, he knew he would never attain the position. So instead he asked for and was granted the governorship of Egypt. As Egypt had only entered the empire a generation before by conquest and was far from Istanbul, he knew it would be easy to rebel there. He quietly sent word to all quarters, even to the Christians asking for allies. Then one night, he had all the local janissaries massacred and declared himself Sultan of Egypt. The rebellion was put down, but after that, rebellion after rebellion cropped up, so Suleiman sent the only man he could trust to try and bring the situation to heel, and Ibrahim succeeded. He crushed the remaining embers of rebellion in Egypt and in Syria.. But he did more than that for his genius was not just military. He reorganized the provinces, putting in a system of checks and balances to make sure that no one group could become powerful enough to challenge the Sultan. And those provinces had never rebelled again. After this, Suleiman began to rely on his friend more and more for the daily administration of the empire. Ibrahim was capable, shrewd and most of all loyal, and even he the great Sultan could not by himself manage an empire so large. And so they planned and they plotted for the next stage of his campaign. He would cow the Persians with words and make the world think that he was going to go after his Shia arrivals to the south, but in truth He planned to once again invade Hungary, and finish what he'd started. Meanwhile he also worked with Ibrahim on his other great project, the Kanun-I or laws. He had long since realized that there were things that Sharia simply did not cover, things that were vital to a modern evolving empire. Things like taxation and certain aspect of administration. His ancestors, too had realized this to some degree, but he wanted to take it further. To really rationalize the hodgepodge of laws made by those before him. But even as his legal scholars began to put together the laws, the preparations for his Hungarian war were completed. It was time to campaign again. Europe was more divided than ever, with a league of almost every Christian nation formed to fight against Charles the fifth and the Hapsburgs. Hungry would once again be alone. With a hundred thousand men, with his Vizier and friend Ibrahim as their principal commander, Suleiman marched North for Buda . Then the rains began. Torrents, sheets of rain, rivers overflowed their banks. Roads were turned into marshes, but the iron discipline of army held. Some of the larger cannons were lost or delayed but it was of little consequence. His great army marched north. As they reached Sofia, Ibrahim broke off a small contingent to capture the fortress of Petrovaradin, while he the Sultan continued the march north with the main force. Mere days later, his favorite road back to him with spoils and the heads of 500 of the castles defenders in tow. He had lost only 25 men.The Sultan embraced his favorite, and there was rejoicing in the camp. At last they crossed the Danube. Burning their bridges along the way so no man would think to retreat. After that came the peat bogs and the marshes that surrounded the river. They trudged through equipment, and horses having to be dragged out of the mire. Or abandoned along the way But finally they emerged onto the shining Mohacs Plain. There before him were arrayed the Knights of Lewis, the child king of Hungary. How small they looked, how pitiful in number? His great hosts would wash around them like a tide dragging a man out to sea. Ibrahim stood with him looking out over the field. He was relaying intelligence recently gathered. There were only 25 or 30,000 men facing his hundred thousand. The impetuous nobles of Hungary had not even waited for the reinforcements coming to them. They had forced their king onto the field. And there they stood in all their gleaming armor. Armor which would only slow them down. They had not even set up defensive works. They clearly planned to take the offensive, using the shock of armored Knights against the fire of his janissaries and his great guns. As his men drew up their lines, Ibrahim embraced him and rode off to take his place. As Ibrahim rode, he spoke to the men promising them great wealth, glory, and the everlasting honor of adding new lands to the empire. Then he took his position at the front. The undisciplined Hungarians began their charge moving not as one solid block, but has a thousand groups of men each eager to crush a foe that they thought inferior. Horses and men, iron and steel, a hundred stone in weight thundered down the plain, hooves tearing the sodden ground. Riders shouting Battle cries in a language Suleiman didn't understand. Volley after volley rolled out from his janissarie's muskets. Men in steel and plate fell and yet they charged on.The flag of Ibrahim was everywhere on his side of the field, holding rallying attacking like a hawk. But on the other side, the desperate charge of desperate men pushed into the line, hacking and slashing their way forward. And then they were upon him. Suleiman's steed reared, his saber flashed. Something hit his breastplate. His guard were all around him fighting, a frenzied melee with some handful of knights that in their furor had somehow made it close to his person. And then it was over Somewhere in there the momentum had stopped. The suicidal bravery of those foolish and undisciplined knights had been met with a sterner bravery of the Sultan's troops and raw numbers had won out. The Ottoman army slowly enclosed the Hungarians and wiped them out. Only a handful managed to escape. Ibrahim rode up to him still covered in the blood and a dust of the battle. The historians would write of him that his lance was like the beak of the falcon of vigor and his sword like the claws of the lion of bravery. They embraced again. They would celebrate this victory for many nights. But then a rider came up to him to report that the body of the Hungarian King had been found. They rode out to see it. Looking over this young corpse, he felt immense sorrow Suleiman wanted this boy's kingdom, he'd needed his land. But he'd not wanted this. But they had won a great victory for Islam, and Abraham had proven himself the man that Suleiman knew him to be. This promised only greater days ahead for them, When they returned to the capital of the world, Istanbul "
287,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,Epuxm-GtT1g,"Khosrau had been at the top of the world. Now, he lay tossing and turning on a bed far from his royal palace, surrounded by an army that couldn't even stand, much less raise a sword. And as word of Khosrau's illness traveled home, it reached the ears of his son, Anush Zad. Music (Birth of the People) Anush Zad had been locked in prison. Not the Fortress of Oblivion, there were too many Kavadh shaped holes in that particular jail. No. A different prison just outside Ctesiphon. The young man had been caught getting busy with some of Khosrau's wives, and was locked away as punishment. Well briefly. It turns out that jail breaking skills ran in the family. Just like the Mazdakites had flocked to Kawus a decade prior, Christians in Khosrau's court began flocking to his Christian son Anush Zad. But here Khosraus's reform efforts came to his rescue. Even though the army he'd led against Rome was now devastated by plague, He still had plenty of loyal soldiers serving back home. When one of them brought word of Anush Zad's rebellion, Khosrau sent the man back with two objectives; kill the Christians and capture my son. The fight was bloody. Khosrau's generals quickly overpowered Anush Zad, who had little military experience, but the young man refused to be captured. He died fighting alongside his followers, who were quickly rounded up and put to the sword. Khosrau prided himself on his open-mindedness, and once boasted that he had not rejected anyone for belonging to a different religion or people, but while he continued to defend Christianity's right to exist within his empire, he began to view certain Christians as political threats. Those who had supported Anush Zad seemed to demand a ruler who shared their faith, and already Khosrau had seen two territories on his western border try to leave his empire to join Christian Rome. The political power of Christianity threatened to overwhelm Iran and Khosrau had to stop it. Plague had forced him to make peace with Justinian, but that very peace allowed him to turn his attention toward Justinian's allies. Christians from Ethiopia had crossed over into Yemen decades before, and during the war Justinian had tried to convince them to attack Iran across the Persian Gulf. They would have don it too, if they didn't have so many of their own civil war issues to deal with. Khosrau seized this opportunity He marched his army into Yemen, pushed back the Ethiopians, and installed a loyal Arabic King. In a single move, he not only managed to push Justinian's allies out of the region and replace them with his own, but he also locked down the last sea route to India. Now both Rome and Africa would have to go through his ports and pay his taxes if they wanted luxury spices, silks, and teas from the east. Unfortunately Khosrau's control of the eastern trade soon put him at odds with his own allies. You remember those Hephthalites who killed Khosrau's grandfather? Kavadh had eventually sought revenge for that offense by waging several wars against them- after using their help and technology to secure his own throne, of course. But as always, it fell to Khosrau to finish the job. He teamed up with the northern Turks to attack the Hephthalites from multiple directions, and together they wiped the Hepthalite empire off the face of the earth. Khosrau took a chunk out of their old southern territory and left the rest to the Turks, so they could form their own new kingdom in the north. The Turks settled right in and started trading with merchants from the Silk Road. They wanted to follow Iran's lead and sell their new luxury goods to the Romans at a huge markup. But to get to Rome they would have to go through Iran. They naturally assumed that their old ally Khosrau would be cool about this, and give them a lower tax rate. But Khosrau did not 'be cool'. He had just secured the last few silk trade routes for his empire. Why would he want to give up that monopoly? So he sent the Turks away empty-handed. And naturally, they were furious, but the Turks had learned a few tricks during their time allied with Khosrau. They sent a message to Rome proposing that the two of them team up to form a pincer around Iran. Exactly like Khosrau had urged them to do to the Hephthalites. Now, Justinian had passed away at this point, and left the throne to his nephew, Justin the second, and Rome wasn't doing so hot. All of the looming problems of Justinian's grand and ambitious reign had collapsed on to his nephew. The treasury was empty, The army was stretched thin, and Justin was just not the same savvy operator his uncle had been. Justin resented the annual tribute that Justinian had agreed to pay Iran for guarding the Caucasian gates, and destroying Iran seemed like the best solution- which maybe it would have been, if he'd had a competent army, or money, or any advantage at all, really. The one advantage he'd expected to have didn't materialize. The Turks never got their army together to support Rome's attack. But Justin wanted this war now and Khosrau's growing distrust of the Christians in his empire soon provoked it. In an effort to prevent any more of his border territories from switching sides, Khosrau sent an administrator to the Christian province of Greater Armenia with orders to strengthen Zoroastrian worship there. Despite the objections of the Armenians, who had long ago been promised a religious freedom, Khosrau's official built a new Zoroastrian Fire Temple. The Armenians reached out to Justin, asking if he would support them switching sides, and of course he would. So they launched their war in the most dramatic way possible; The Armenians killed Khosrau's official and Justin immediately halted his tribute to Iran. Khosrau cracked his knuckles at this and replied, All right kiddo. Let me show you why your uncle learned never to mess with me. Once again the armies of Iran swept into eastern Rome. Khosrau relished this chance to finish what he'd started thirty years ago, and despite being seventy years old now, he led the armies himself. They swept up towns along the border while Justin's troops languished in a siege in an Armenian city not far from Dara. Furious that his army had accomplished so little while Iran had conquered so much, Justin abruptly fired his general and left his troops in a panic. They abandoned the siege and fled, leaving their weapons and equipment behind. Khosrau sauntered over to the abandoned war camp, picked up those weapons with a ""thank you very much"", and set off to conquer Dara. Been 72 years since the Romans built that fort in violation of the treaty they once had with Iran, and to Khosrau that meant that it was well past time that Dara fell. He spared no expense He diverted an entire River and cut all of the aqueducts to break the city's water supply. Then he carved rocks from the mountains themselves to build ramparts that would let his troops storm over the wall. Dara, that monument to Roman treachery and stubborn defiance, Finally fell. When Justin heard about this loss, it broke him. He descended into madness, literally snapping at the attendants who tried to nurse him back to health. During a rare moment of lucidity, Justin's wife Sofia convinced him to appoint his general, Tiberius, as Co-Emperor. She also negotiated a short truce with Khosrau, and bought Rome time to stabilize. In return, Khosrau got to have free reign in Armenia, which the truce now left unprotected. He quickly moved his army over there and began sacking cities, while Tiberius struggled to put his army back together. It took five years, but he did it. He was finally ready to take on Khosrau. The old Shah was so preoccupied leading his troops over in Armenia that this newly rejuvenated Roman force caught him by surprise. They circled his camp at night and forced him to flee, abandoning his pavilion and all of the riches he'd gathered. His retreat path led across a river, but while Khosrau crossed safely on the back of an elephant, many of his troops were swept away. Only by wreaking havoc and setting fire to the towns on the other side of the river did he manage to throw off the Roman pursuit and escape to the safety of Iranian land. The shame of this defeat compelled Khosrau to pass a new law, forbidding future Shahs from leading armies into battle. He returned to Ctesiphon and let his generals take the lead. The excited Roman generals pushed their advantage but they pushed too far, handing an easy victory back to Iran that stabilized the war. Both sides sought peace at this point. An embassy from Tiberius was on its way to Iran for approval of the final terms, but before it even reached Ctesiphon, Khosrau died of old age. Khosrau had built upon the groundwork laid by his father to remake an empire and create an Iranian Golden Age. But that Golden Age ended with him. His son rejected the peace terms with Rome and went back to war. He quarreled with the Arabic allies who had so long guarded Iran's southern border. The Turks saw this long-awaited opportunity and struck at his overextended armies. In the end, even the courts turned against Khosrau's son and overthrew him. In the decades that followed the Sasanian dynasty struggled to maintain the vast army Khosrau had built. They struggled to support the centers of learning Khosrau had cherished. And ultimately they fell. Not to Rome, and not to Christianity, but to the Muslims, a new force that rose up from the south. And here perhaps, Khosrau found his legacy. Because while his descendants had failed to keep the empire together, the Muslims studied his way of governing Iran and adopted it. They admired his university and brought its wisdom back with them to Baghdad. But that is a story for another day. Thanks for watching.

288,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,FN3MFhYPWWo,"It's a hot day, and you've just downed  several glasses of water, one after the other. Behind the sudden urge that follows are two bean-shaped organs that work as fine-tuned internal sensors. They balance the amount of fluid in your body, detect waste in your blood, and know when to release  the vitamins, minerals, and hormones you need to stay alive. Say hello to your kidneys. The main role of these organs is to dispose of waste products and to turn them into urine. The body's eight liters of blood pass through the kidneys between 20 and 25 times each day, meaning that, together, these organs filter about 180 liters every 24 hours. The ingredients in your blood are constantly changing as you ingest food and drink, which explains why the kidneys need to be on permanent duty. Blood enters each kidney through arteries that branch and branch, until they form tiny vessels that entwine with special internal modules, called nephrons. In each kidney, 1 million of these nephrons form a powerful array of filters and sensors that carefully sift through the blood. This is where we see just how refined and accurate this internal sensing system is. To filter the blood, each nephron uses two powerful pieces of equipment: a blob-like structure called a glomerulus, and a long, stringy, straw-like tubule. The glomerulus works like a sieve, allowing only certain ingredients, such as vitamins and minerals, to pass into the tubule. Then, this vessel's job is to detect whether any of those ingredients  are needed in the body. If so, they're reabsorbed in amounts that the body needs, so they can circulate in the blood again. But the blood doesn't only carry useful ingredients. It contains waste products, too. And the nephrons have to figure out  what to do with them. The tubules sense compounds  the body doesn't need, like urea, left over from the breakdown of proteins, and redirects them as urine  out of the kidneys and through two long sewers called ureters. The tubes empty their contents into the bladder to be discharged, ridding your body of that waste once and for all. There's water in that urine, too. If the kidney detects too much of it in your blood, for instance, when you've chugged several glasses at once, it sends the extra liquid to the bladder to be removed. On the other hand, low water levels in the blood prompt the kidney to release some back into the blood stream, meaning that less water  makes it into the urine. This is why urine appears yellower when you're less hydrated. By controlling water, your kidneys stabilize the body's fluid levels. But this fine balancing act isn't the kidney's only skill. These organs have the power  to activate vitamin D to secrete a hormone called renin that raises blood pressure, and another hormone  called erythropoietin, which increases red blood cell production. Without the kidneys, our bodily fluids  would spiral out of control. Every time we ate, our blood would receive another load of unsifted ingredients. Soon, the buildup of waste would overload our systems and we'd expire. So each kidney not only  keeps things running smoothly. It also keeps us alive. Lucky then that we have two  of these magical beans. "
289,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,FZ_jNGKCIWs,"All year long, researchers at hundreds of hospitals around the world collect samples from flu patients and send them to top virology experts with one goal: to design the vaccine  for the next flu season. But why do we need a new one every year? Vaccines for diseases like mumps and rubella offer a lifetime of protection with two shots early in life. What's so special about the flu? Two factors make the flu a tough target. First, there are more than 100 subtypes of the influenza virus, and the ones in circulation  change from season to season. And second, the flu's genetic code allows it to mutate more quickly than many other viruses. The flu spreads by turning a host's own cells into viral production factories. When the virus is engulfed by a host cell, it expels its genetic material, which makes its way to the nucleus. There, cellular machinery that normally copies the host's genes starts replicating viral genes instead, creating more and more copies of the virus. New viruses are repackaged and crammed into the cell until it bursts, sending freshly minted influenza viruses out to infect additional cells. Most viruses follow this script. The trick with the flu is that its genetic material isn't DNA but a similar compound called RNA. And RNA viruses can mutate much faster. When cells synthesize DNA, a built-in proofreader recognizes  and corrects mistakes, but the RNA synthesis mechanism doesn't have this fail-safe. If errors creep in, they stick around creating new variants of the virus. Why is this a problem? Because vaccines depend on recognition. The flu vaccine includes some of the same substances, called antigens, found on the surface of the virus itself. The body identifies those fragments as foreign and responds by producing compounds called antibodies, tailor-made to match the antigens. When a vaccinated person encounters the actual virus, the preprogrammed antibodies help the immune system identify the threat and mobilize quickly to prevent an infection. Those antigens are different for every strain of influenza. If vaccination has prepared the immune system for one strain, a different one may still be able to sneak by. Even within the same strain of flu, those rapid genetic mutations can change the surface compounds enough that the antibodies  may not recognize them. To make things even more complicated, sometimes two different strains combine to create an entirely new hybrid virus. All of this makes vaccinating for the flu like trying to hit a moving transforming target. That's why scientists are constantly collecting data about which strains are circulating and checking to see how much those strains have mutated from previous years' versions. Twice annually, the World Health Organization pulls together experts to analyze all that data, holding one meeting for each hemisphere. The scientists determine which strains to include in that season's vaccine, picking four for the quadrivalent vaccine in use today. In spite of the flu's evasive maneuvers, in recent years, the group's predictions have been almost always correct. Even when flu strains mutate further, the vaccine is often close enough that a vaccinated person who catches the flu anyway will have a milder and shorter illness than they would otherwise. Vaccination also helps protect other people in the community who may not be medically eligible  for the shot by preventing those around them from carrying the virus. This is called herd immunity. The flu shot can't give you the flu. It contains an inactivated virus that isn't capable of making you sick. You might feel tired and achy after getting it, but that's not an infection. It's your normal immune response to the vaccine. Some parts of the world use, instead of a shot, an inhaled vaccine that contains a weakened live virus. This is also safe for  the vast majority of people. Only those with impaired immune systems would be at risk, but they're typically not given live vaccines. Meanwhile, scientists are working to develop a universal flu vaccine that would protect against any strain, even mutated ones. But until then, the hunt  for next year's vaccine is on. "
290,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Fj2hTS5Kjyw,"It’s an incredible discovery: an ancient, abandoned alien space station filled with precursor technology. But now, every species in the galaxy is in a mad dash to get there first and claim it for themselves. And right away, you’ve got a problem. Your ship’s faster-than-light jump drive consumes 1 unit of fuel for every parsec of distance it takes you, and your ship holds only 15 units of fuel. But the space station is 23 parsecs away, and there’s only empty space between there and here. There’s one thing that can  help you, though: dark matter fuel is stable in deep space. That means you can vent a cache of it from your fuel chamber, and then come back to pick  it up again later. Even though your ship holds  only 15 units of fuel, you’ve been granted use of all 45 units  in your current location. With some strategic fuel caching  along the way, you might be able to make it all 23 parsecs. So how can you reach the  alien space station? Answer in 3, 2, 1. It’s possible to solve this riddle using as few as two cache points, and there are also valid solutions  that use more. No matter how you go about it though, the key is determining exactly where to cache fuel along your route. Let’s work backwards from the alien space station. To reach 23 parsecs, you’ll have to leave the 8-parsec mark with a full tank of fuel. The 8-parsec point is too far from the start to use as a cache right away; you could jump there, but wouldn’t have enough fuel to return to the start, let alone store any for later. So that means you’ll need to find a cache  somewhere between the start and 8. But where? There’s an interesting pattern  that can help. At the start you have exactly 3 tanks’  worth of fuel. At 8 parsecs you need exactly 1. Is there a point, which we can call point X, where you could have exactly 2? That would be useful, because then you could refuel there exactly twice, making full use of your storage capacity without any waste. Wherever point X is, you’ll jump forward from it twice: once to deposit some fuel at the 8-parsec cache point, and a second time for good. So you’ll jump the distance between X and  8-parsecs 3 times in all. You’d have 2 tanks of fuel at point X, and need 1 left at the 8 parsec cache point, so you can spend one tank-- or 15 units--  going back and forth. Since 15 units divided by 3 trips is 5, we can place these two cache points 5 parsecs apart. Any farther, and you wouldn’t have enough fuel to reach the alien space station. So it looks like the earliest we can place point X is at the 3-parsec mark. Is it possible to transport 30 units of  fuel there? Let’s try. You set out with a full tank of 15 units. You jump 3 parsecs, drop 9 units off at the cache point, and then jump the 3 units home, arriving with an empty tank. Repeating this process gets you 18 units of fuel at the cache point, and one more jump puts you at the 3-parsec cache with 30 total units of fuel. So far so good! Next, you jump to the 8-parsec mark, drop off 5 units of fuel, and jump back to the 3-parsec mark. You fill up your tank and  jump forward again, arriving with 10 units of  fuel in your tank. And now the end is in sight. You beam the 5 units of fuel in from deep  space to fill your tank to capacity, and type in the coordinates of  your final destination. A 15-parsec jump leaves you  running on fumes, but ready to dock with the precursor space station. Time to put this alien tech to work and make life better for everyone  in the galaxy. "
291,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,Fsk6oZm1EEA,"[Music] When we last left off Harley, the chancellor of the [exchequer], and Blunt, one of the principal operatives  of the Hollow Sword Blade Company Were looking for something bigger and better than a simple lottery to keep the government afloat. The scheme they came up with was the  South Sea Company. It's South Sea Company by the way, not South Seas  Company. I think I was saying South Seas company for the entire last episode -- Sorry about that. Anyway, Harley, stymied at every turn and frustrated with the Whig controlled Bank of England's refusal to help finally thought what if we just built a Tory controlled company to do the Bank of England's job; at which point Blunt probably  started seeing dollar signs and hyperventilating. Together they came up  with a plan for a trading company that would assume all of the government's debt. Here's how  it would work: Anybody who held British government debt would get to exchange that debt for Shares in the new Company. The government would pay the newly formed company roughly 6% interest on that debt or about £500,000, a far lower interest rate than the government had been paying when All the debt was in the hands of private individuals The company would then turn around and use that money  as a dividend for its investors But in order to make  this offer enticing there had to be  something more and that's where the South Seas  part comes in you see fundamentally to convince anybody holding government debt to give up the principle of their debt -- the amount of money they first lent to the government -- for stock in an unknown company and the dividend payment that was probably lower than the interest they were supposed  to be getting anyway You'd have to convince them  that the stock they were getting was going to be worth far more than the debt  they already held. So on top of that half a million pounds the government was going to give the company annually it also gave them a monopoly  on trading in the south Seas, and man did they turn on the hype machine for this? Everybody from the government to the directors of  the Hollow Sword Blade company to Daniel Defoe  (The guy who wrote Robinson Crusoe) started talking about the unimaginable riches that would flow from the south Seas into Britain once this company was [established] and Everybody in Britain knew how well the Honourable East Indian Company had done for its shareholders Here was a chance [to] get in on the ground floor of something similar there was only one small problem with this scheme: the south seas mentioned in the deal referred to Central and South America and by Central and South America, they meant all the major ports in Central and South America and by all the major ports they meant a bunch of ports that happens to be exclusively owned by Spain and Well Britain was currently at war with Spain like I said last time Britain was at war with like everybody This didn't faze Harley or Blunt though to them the answer was simple They would simply end a decades-long multinational war. This time, they got the guy who wrote Gulliver's Travels to do their propaganda work they laid it on so thick they even got the famous Whig Sir Robert Walpole; and John Churchill, The Duke of Marlborough, a hero of the war of Spanish Succession locked in the Tower of London as part of their efforts to smear the opposition But for all this they still didn't have the votes they needed to get past the House of Lords. Funny thing about the house of lords though all you had to do to be a part of it was be a lord. You didn't need to be elected to the House of Lords. Until recently if you were a peer of the realm, you just got a seat. So with a little prodding from Harley, the Queen created 12 new peers and presto! A majority of the house of lords now wanted peace. But oh the irony. By locking themselves into peace they locked themselves out of the peace they wanted. Britain's push for peace meant that they made peace independently and earlier  than their war allies, which left them with a little to bargain with when it came time to actually work out the terms of the Peace. In the end, the Spanish gave  the South Sea Company the Questionably lucrative right to trade slaves in the south Seas, and the right to send one ship a year  to each of the Spanish ports. One ship a year! The Honourable  East India Company was sending fleets of ships every month to maintain the kind of profits that Blunt and Harley had advertised! So while the public would continue to be told about the riches [of] the South Seas it was now clear to everybody close to the venture that the South Sea Company was really just a financial institution Whose sole business was managing the government debt. Then, in 1714, Queen Anne, the Monarch of England, died without an heir. After much debate, George the First the elector of Hanover, was chosen by Parliament to succeed Anne, and with the new King, came a new government. Harley fell out of favour and the whigs regained dominance, so what did our good Mr. Blunt do in response? He did what any  upstanding citizen would do and promptly booted his earstwhile ally Harley to the curb, replaced most of the Tory board members in the South Sea Company with wigs and in a stroke of genius Got the King's son, George the Second, to replace Harley as the largely ceremonial Governor of the company. He even got the king, who was desperate for funds for the Royal household, to invest in the company himself To further smooth things over in the transition, and to avoid some of the wrath of the now Resurgent Walpole and Churchill -- the very men the South Sea Company got locked up a few years before -- the South Sea Company agreed to forgive the two years of interest the previous government had owed it, which helped the new administration to keep things afloat. In return, the government allowed the company to issue more stock of an equivalent value to offset the loss Which meant the company had roughly 10 million pounds of stock issued. To put that in perspective, That's about half the total value of stock issued by all companies in England. This for a trading company That's only ever managed to lose money on trading. This wild success led members of the government to decide that it was time to offload more of the government's debt onto the South Sea Company. Because why wouldn't you, right? After all, if one company accounted for more than half of saved the New York stock exchange, With no discernible source of income, clearly the correct play would be to make it bigger instead of you know Investigating its activities. So the new plan was to allow the South Sea Company to issue even more stock and in exchange the company Wait for it would handle the government's debt from running the 1710 lottery -- the lottery Blunt himself had created! Genius! That is a Montgomery Burnsian kind of genius. But make no mistake: The government's strange confidence in the South Sea Company wasn't just due to starry-eyed Politicians desire for somebody else to deal with their mess. There was something else to it. In 1717, the King and his son George II had gotten into a fight. In an act of spite, The King had removed his son as Governor of the South Sea Company, and replaced him with himself! John Blunt now had the King himself as the Company's Royal figurehead . Whoa, right? Not only did this mean that they received a level of trust and prestige that they had never even come close to earning, But it also meant that the company was now, in some ways, too big to fail. If the South Sea Company collapsed, so might faith in the monarch, and they couldn't let that happen. But in 1719, as the lottery debt was being exchanged, another strange occurrence happened There was a brief abortive attempt to overthrow the King by the Jacobites -- the branch of the English monarchy that had itself been overthrown during the Civil war 70 Years before -- it wasn't successful But when that whole affair was put to rest the South Sea Company did everything they could to fuel the sense of jubilation Spreading around England. Going so far as to peddle Fabrications like the fact that the pretender to the throne had been captured, ending the Jacobite threat forever in doing so they managed to crank up the stock of the South Sea Company from a hundred pounds a share to £114 a share. Doesn't this make you just want to hit one of these people? And that stock value increase is important because when the company had agreed With the government on how much stock they were going to issue, They agreed to an amount that would let them cover all the debt they were picking up at a hundred pounds a share But now as the stock price rose, They found themselves paying for that same debt at a hundred and fourteen pounds a share, and at that rate They didn't even need all those shares to cover the debt anymore! What did they do with all those extra shares that they'd issued, but that they've no longer needed to cover the debt they were obligated to pick up? Why, they sold them and pocketed the profit -- because of course they did! This gave Blunt ideas: Very, Very big ideas Join us next time for the meteoric rise of the South Sea Company, the ennobling of John Blunt, and a company valuation higher than all the currency currently in circulation in England!

292,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Fzz-Pblbvqw,"In the 1950s, a group of ranchers in Idaho were baffled when their sheep gave birth to lambs with a singular deformity. Mystified by these cyclops sheep, they called in scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to investigate. The researchers hypothesized that the pregnant ewes had snacked on poisonous  birth defect-causing plants. They collected the local flora and fed samples to lab rats, but struggled to replicate the effect. So they decided to directly observe the sheep with one scientist even living with the herd for three summers. After a decade of trial and error, the scientists finally found the culprit, wild corn lilies. The lilies contained an active molecule with six connected rings that they named cyclopamine in reference to the cyclops sheep. They didn't know exactly how cyclopamine caused the defect but told ranchers to steer clear. It took about four decades before a team of biologists, led by Professor Philip Beachy, stumbled upon the answer. His lab was studying a specific gene found in many species, from mice to humans, called the hedgehog gene. It was named by two scientists, who later shared the Noble Prize for their work, who found that mutating this gene in fruit flies produced pointy spikes like a hedgehog. Beachy and his colleagues performed genetic modifications to turn off the hedgehog genes in mice. This resulted in severe defects in the development of their brains, organs, and eyes or, rather, eye. Then while perusing a textbook, Beachy  came across photos of the cyclops sheep and realized what had eluded scientists for four decades. Something must have gone awry  involving the hedgehog gene. Let's take a step back. Genes contain instructions that tell cells what to do and when to do it, and they communicate their directives using proteins. The hedgehog gene itself tells cells to release a so-called hedgehog protein, which kicks off a complex series of cellular signals. Here's how it works in normal healthy development. Hedgehog protein latches on to a protein called patched. That inhibits, or holds, patched back, allowing another protein called smoothened to freely signal the cells, telling them where to go and what kind of tissues to become. Cyclopamine, say in the form of a delicious corn lily, interrupts this pathway by binding onto smoothened. That locks smoothened up so that it's unable to send the signals needed to mold the brain  into two hemispheres, and form fingers or separate eyes. So even though the hedgehog protein is still doing its job of keeping the way clear for smoothened, cyclopamine blocks smoothened from passing along its chemical message. That settled the science behind the one-eyed sheep, but Beachy and his team caught the glimmer of another more beneficial connection. They noted that uncontrolled activation of the smoothened protein was associated with a human syndrome. It's known as Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome, and it predisposes people to certain cancers. The scientists proposed putting cyclopamine's smoothened  binding powers to good use as a treatment for these cancers, as long as the patient wasn't pregnant. Unfortunately, researchers eventually found that cyclopamine causes negative side effects, and its chemical properties make it difficult to work with. But they did discover that closely related molecules are safe and effective, and two of these drugs were approved in 2012 and 2015 as skin cancer medicines. When those farmers first saw the cyclops sheep, they could have chalked it up to a freak genetic mutation and walked away. Instead, their decision to investigate turned a mystery into medicine showing that sometimes there's more than meets the eye. "
293,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,GASaqPv0t0g,"In 1997, a French woman named  Jeanne Calment passed away after 122 years and 164 days on this Earth, making her the oldest known  person in history. Her age was so astounding that a millionaire pledged $1 million to anyone who could break her record. But in reality, living to this age or beyond is a feat that very few, maybe even no humans, are likely to accomplish. Human bodies just aren't built for extreme aging. Our capacity is set at about 90 years. But what does aging really mean and how does it counteract the body's efforts to stay alive? We know intuitively what it means to age. For some, it means growing up, while for others, it's growing old. Yet finding a strict scientific definition of aging is a challenge. What we can say is that aging occurs when intrinsic processes and interactions with the environment, like sunlight, and toxins in the air, water,  and our diets, cause changes in the structure and function of the body's  molecules and cells. Those changes in turn drive their decline, and subsequently, the failure of the whole organism. The exact mechanisms of aging are poorly understood. But recently, scientists have identified nine physiological traits, ranging from genetic changes to alterations in  a cell's regenerative ability that play a central role. Firstly, as the years pass, our bodies accumulate genetic damage in the form of DNA lesions. These occur naturally when the body's DNA replicates, but also in non-dividing cells. Organelles called mitochondria are especially prone to this damage. Mitochondria produce adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, the main energy source for all cellular processes, plus mitochondria regulate many different cell activities and play an important role in programmed cell death. If mitochondrial function declines, then cells and, later on, whole organs, deteriorate, too. Other changes are known to occur in the expression patterns of genes, also known as epigenetic alterations, that affect the body's tissues and cells. Genes silenced or expressed only at low levels in newborns become prominent in older people, leading to the development of degenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's, which accelerate aging. Even if we could avoid all these harmful genetic alterations, not even our own cells could save us. The fact remains that cellular regeneration, the very stuff of life, declines as we age. The DNA in our cells is packaged within chromosomes, each of which has two protective regions at the extremities called telomeres. Those shorten every time cells replicate. When telomeres become too short, cells stop replicating and die, slowing the body's ability to renew itself. With age,  cells increasingly grow senescent, too, a process that halts the cell cycle in times of risk, like when cancer cells are proliferating. But the response also kicks in more as we age, halting cell growth and cutting short their ability to replicate. Aging also involves stem cells that reside in many tissues and have the property of dividing without limits to replenish other cells. As we get older, stem cells decrease in number and tend to lose  their regenerative potential, affecting tissue renewal and maintenance of our organs original functions. Other changes revolve around cells'  ability to function properly. As they age, they stop being able to do quality control on proteins, causing the accumulation of damaged and potentially toxic nutrients, leading to excessive metabolic activity that could be fatal for them. Intercellular communication also slows, ultimately undermining the body's functional ability. There's a lot we don't yet understand about aging. Ultimately, does longer life as we know it come down to diet, exercise, medicine, or something else? Will future technologies, like cell-repairing nanobots, or gene therapy, artificially extend our years? And do we want to live longer than we already do? Starting with 122 years as inspiration, there's no telling where our curiosity might take us. "
294,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,GJHhnr9R_ZM,"What if electricity could travel forever without being diminished? What if a computer could run exponentially faster with perfect accuracy? What technology could  those abilities build? We may be able to find out thanks to the work of the three scientists who won the Nobel Prize  in Physics in 2016. David Thouless, Duncan Haldane, and Michael Kosterlitz won the award for discovering that even microscopic matter at the smallest scale can exhibit macroscopic properties and phases that are topological. But what does that mean? First of all, topology is a branch of mathematics that focuses on fundamental properties of objects. Topological properties don't change when an object is gradually stretched or bent. The object has to be torn or attached in new places. A donut and a coffee cup look the same to a topologist because they both have one hole. You could reshape a donut  into a coffee cup and it would still have just one. That topological property is stable. On the other hand,  a pretzel has three holes. There are no smooth incremental changes that will turn a donut into a pretzel. You'd have to tear two new holes. For a long time, it wasn't clear whether topology was useful for describing the behaviors of subatomic particles. That's because particles, like electrons and photons, are subject to the strange laws of quantum physics, which involve a great deal of uncertainty that we don't see at the scale of coffee cups. But the Nobel Laureates discovered that topological properties do exist at the quantum level. And that discovery may revolutionize materials science, electronic engineering, and computer science. That's because these properties lend surprising stability and remarkable characteristics to some exotic phases of matter in the delicate quantum world. One example is called  a topological insulator. Imagine a film of electrons. If a strong enough magnetic field passes through them, each electron will start traveling in a circle, which is called a closed orbit. Because the electrons are stuck in these loops, they're not conducting electricity. But at the edge of the material, the orbits become open, connected, and they all point in the same direction. So electrons can jump from one orbit to the next and travel all the way around the edge. This means that the material conducts electricity around the edge but not in the middle. Here's where topology comes in. This conductivity isn't affected by small changes in the material, like impurities or imperfections. That's just like how the hole in the coffee cup isn't changed by stretching it out. The edge of such a topological insulator has perfect electron transport: no electrons travel backward, no energy is lost as heat, and the number of conducting pathways can even be controlled. The electronics of the future  could be built to use this perfectly efficient electron highway. The topological properties of subatomic particles could also transform quantum computing. Quantum computers  take advantage of the fact that subatomic particles can be in different states at the same time to store information in something called qubits. These qubits can solve problems exponentially faster than classical digital computers. The problem is that this data is so delicate that interaction with the environment can destroy it. But in some exotic topological phases, the subatomic particles can become protected. In other words, the qubits formed by them can't be changed by small  or local disturbances. These topological qubits would be more stable, leading to more accurate computation and a better quantum computer. Topology was originally studied as a branch of purely abstract mathematics. Thanks to the pioneering work of Thouless, Haldane, and Kosterlitz, we now know it can be used to understand the riddles of nature and to revolutionize  the future of technologies. "
295,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,GKtNuzakzMA," In the last episode, we got to the ad hoc, unofficial beginnings of paper money. This week, we'll look at some of the rogues' gallery that really created the intellectual argument for adopting paper money in some more official way. When we last left off in England in 1640, the first unofficial banknotes were starting to circulate But in the early 1660s in Stockholm, the first semi-official banknotes, the first banknotes from what we might think of as a central bank, the first banknotes that really started to replace a hard currency. Began to appear But with those banknotes, come  the problem of unregulated Fractional Reserve Banking Remember how we mentioned that the Goldsmiths of London realized that using banknotes, they could actually lend out more money than they had gold or silver to cover? Well in Stockholm, they really went to town. Soon, there were so many banknotes out there, that people couldn't help but notice, And as soon as people noticed, everybody rushed to the bank to get their banknotes turned back into coins. Which of course they couldn't do. And there goes the Swedish economy. So, clearly there were still some kinks to work out with these newfangled banknotes. Now let's hop back to England, once Civil War, and half a Dozen other wars After Charles I so politely jump started this whole banking thing which that forced loan of his. The year is 1695, the English have just gotten themselves kicked around  in the Channel by the French. And if we know anything about history, we know that that will never do. So, the English established a Central Bank, the Bank of England To raise money and to help the government pay to refit the navy As part of this, they issued banknotes, but the idea of banknotes, and their role in the economy had been a topic of debate in England for a few years. Which leads us to the first of our roguish economic theorists. And yes, this is his real name - Nicholas If-Jesus-Christ-Had-Not-Died-For-Thee-Thou-Hadst-Been-Damned Barebone Who, for obvious reasons went by the name - Nicholas Barbon Nicholas Barbon's father was Praise God Barebone (Yes really) Who will surely make an appearance in episodes covering the English civil war Nick Barbon started his career as a doctor, getting his degree from the University of Utrecht And joining the Royal College of Physicians But this trade had too much saving people, and too little amassing vast quantities of wealth. So Nicholas turned instead to Real Estate and Construction. Luckily, he had in a break, when, in 1666, the Great Fire of London swept through and incinerated about 13,000 homes and left about 1/6 of the city homeless Hussah! This of course was seen as a great opportunity by Barebone who will rebuild most of London And even very illegally, reshape it. If you've ever been to the Western parts of the Strand or Bloomsbury Those areas basically exist because Barebone didn't listen to any of the restrictions that said that you couldn't build between London and Westminster After all, as he saw it, that's where the open land was And where easier to build? I mean, yeahhhhhhh, it's open because it's illegal to build there, but what are they gonna do? Tear down the houses you just built? They're already built. Deal with it. And from there, the sky was the limit. Barebone at first got into the reputable business of selling fire insurance in a town that had just burnt down After that, he realised that he could invent the mortgage, I mean, I can't say that he was absolutely, absolutely, the first person to really invent the modern mortgage, but he certainly was the first major player to do so in England. He created the National Land Bank. And began to issue loans secured by people's homes or properties. He followed that with a few stint in Parliament, largely to avoid prosecution. And then he retired to write some books. And it's really the books that we're interested in. And the thoughts he put in them. Because while I've been joking about his wild and rapacious greed, he was highly intelligent. And it's kinda hard to write him off as evil. All of these things he did actually ended up having positive effects. And his writing sort of shows that he knew that. Insuring people against fire provided him with a guaranteed profit, but also created a great deal more stability for the English economy. Fires were still a major issue, but no longer would they be a massive economic displacement. Instead, everybody would put some money into the pot, to bail out whoever lost their home or trade to a fire And he would skim a little from the top Great for the economy! And mortgages? While we might today that it's the bank's way of keeping us down, so much of England's wealth was locked up in Real Estate that it was a huge drag to the national economy. When people bought a house, that money just stayed locked up in that house It didn't circulate through the economy, it didn't help to finance businesses, it just sat there. Until somebody generations later decided to sell it. But with the idea of the mortgage, the single biggest asset that most people owned was now freed up to help drive the economy Instead of the sellers simply getting a pile of cash, and the buyer getting an unspendable house, the mortgage freed up that value. You could now spend your house and live in it too! Meaning that that money could circulate through the economy again and again. And Barebone was also, of course, one of the first people to decouple morality and spending Which totally sounds evil, I admit, but up until this point, a lot of the writing on money was written by the Church Basically arguing that everybody live the simplest life possible. And that's probably good advice, in a lot of ways, but it doesn't make for a dynamic economy. Barebone argued for fashion and innovation, because they get people to buy new goods before they fully consumed the previous goods, thereby, creating demand, And while we're not to Adam Smith yet, The basic concept that demand creates supply and grows the economy is there in Barebone's work. But for us, his most important work is probably his arguments against Mercantilism Mercantilism was the driving political and economic theory in most of Europe, in Barebone's day. Basically, it sort of saw nations as being in a state of perpetual economic war. The goals for any nation was to get as much literal gold, and silver as they could for itself. And try not to give any to anybody else. In a broader sense, the object was to have your state, be self-sustaining. Importing as little as possible, while exporting as much as you could. Colonies existed to feed the mother country, and weren't allowed to trade with any country other than their colonial power. And when imports had to be made, the goal was to only import raw materials, so that they could be turned into more valuble, finished goods in your country. And while today, we see a lot of reasons why every country trying to produce every type of good is a terrible idea, In some ways, mercantilism makes a lot more sense when you think of economies based on commodity money, like gold or silver. After all, if your entire economy is based on gold and silver, then your economy could literally only be as big as the amount of gold and silver you have. While many were starting to see this dilemma, Barebone cut to the heart of it. He basically said that even gold and silver don't have a innate value. They are just worth whatever the market values them at. So instead of stockpiling more gold and silver to grow your economy, why don't you just get rid of gold and silver entirely? and move to paper money? But these ideas of Barebone's are only the beginning of the intellectual ground work that will see a world accept slips of paper in exchange for a loaf of bread, a cell phone, or a house. Join us next time and we will witness somebody else try and put their own theories of paper money into practice. On the grandest scale. "
296,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,GLllZ-qiXJA,"In 1845, Ireland's vast potato fields were struck by an invasive fungal disease that rapidly infested this staple crop. The effect was devastating. One million people died of famine, and over a million more were forced to leave Ireland. Nowadays, we avoid such agricultural catastrophes with the help of pesticides. Those are a range of manmade chemicals that control insects, unwanted weeds, funguses, rodents, and bacteria that may threaten our food supply. They've become an essential part of our food system. As populations have grown, monoculture, single crop farming, has helped us feed people efficiently. But it's also left our food vulnerable to extensive attack by pests. In turn, we've become more dependent on pesticides. Today, we annually shower over 5 billion pounds of pesticides across the Earth to control these unwanted visitors. The battle against pests, especially insects, has marked agriculture's long history. Records from thousands of years ago suggest that humans actively burned some of their crops after harvest to rid them of pests. There's even evidence from ancient times that we recruited other insects to help. In 300 A.D., Chinese farmers specially bred ferocious predatory ants in orange orchards to protect the trees from other bugs. Later, as large-scale farming spread, we began sprinkling arsenic, lead, and copper treatments on crops. But these were incredibly toxic to humans as well. As our demand for more, safer produce increased, so did the need for effective chemicals that could control pests on a grander scale. This ushered in the era of chemical pesticides. In 1948, a Swiss chemist named Paul Hermann Müller was awarded a Nobel Prize  for his discovery of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, also known as DDT. This new molecule had unparalleled power to control many insect species until the 1950s, when insects became resistant to it. Worse, the chemical actually drove dramatic declines in bird populations, poisoned water sources, and was eventually found to cause long-term health problems in humans. By 1972, DDT had been banned in the United States, and yet traces still linger in the environment today. Since then, chemists have been searching for alternatives. With each new wave of inventions, they've encountered the same obstacle - rapid species evolution. As pesticides destroy pest populations, they leave behind only the most resistant individuals. They then pass on their pesticide-resisting genes to the next generation. That's lead to the rise of super bugs, such as the Colorado potato beetle, which is resistant to over  50 different insecticides. Another downside is that other bugs get caught in the crossfire. Some of these are helpful predators of plant pests or vital pollinators, so erasing them from agriculture wipes out their benefits, too. Pesticides have improved over time and are currently regulated by strict safety standards, but they still have the potential to pollute soil and water, impact wildlife, and even harm us. So considering all these risks, why do we continue using pesticides? Although they're imperfect, they currently may be our best bet against major agricultural disasters, not to mention mosquito-born diseases. Today, scientists are on a quest for alternative pest control strategies that balance the demands of food production with environmental concerns. Nature has become a major source of inspiration, from natural plant and fungal chemicals that can repel or attract insects, to recruiting other insects  as crop bodyguards. We're also turning to high-tech solutions, like drones. Programmed to fly over crops, these machines can use  their sensors and GPS to carry out more targeted sprays that limit a pesticide's wider environmental impact. With a combination  of biological understanding, environmental awareness, and improved technologies, we have a better chance of finding a holistic solution to pests. Chemical pesticides may never shake their controversial reputation, but with their help, we can ensure that  agricultural catastrophes stay firmly in our past. "
297,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,GMVZSxkgcGk," Following his father's death, Kavadh had staved off disaster time and again for the empire. But yearly peace tributes to the Hephtalites had left the Iranian treasury bare. Nothing was left to help the farmers who fed the Empire. Without help, Kavadh's people would soon starve. In desperation, he turned to his neighbours: the Eastern Roman Empire. Despite countless generations of conflict between Rome and Iran, the two empires had been at peace for nearly a century. Nomadic tribes across the Caucasus Mountains to the north had forced them to agree on terms of mutual defense. Iran would guard the pass through the mountains, called the Caucasian Gates, so long as Rome sent money to help pay the soldiers. But the Romans had gotten kind of distracted. They were all like, ""We're kind of dealing with these other wars in the north right now and also in the west, and wait - ah crap, the Ostrogoths just took Rome. Like actual Rome. Ah, geez. Can you guys handle the northern tribes thing while we - Hey, you guys give that back, I am not kidding!"" So Rome had stopped paying for the northern defense, and since Iran had their own problems at the time - multiple wars with the Hephtalites and their King dying, followed by a decade of political turmoil - they weren't exactly in a position to press the issue. But now, now that Kavadh had finally pulled his empire back together; now, it was time to press. Kavadh reached out to the Roman emperor, Anastasius, and insisted that Rome pay its share. That would take some of the strain off of Iran's treasury, so Kavadh could subsidise his farmers and avoid a famine; but Anastasius replied saying, ""Well, we never technically signed an agreement or anything, so we're not going to pay you back, but hey, we can give you a loan!"" To which Kavadh responded, ""I'll loan my fist to your face!"" and went to war. Now, waging war is generally not a good idea for empires on the brink of ruin, but Kavadh really needed this one. Raiding food and supplies from the border cities of the Roman Empire solved his immediate problem of feeding his own empire; and it also solved his long-term problem of getting the Hephtalites off his back. As Iran's eastern neighbours, the Hephtalites very much enjoyed watching Iran go to war with the West. They liked it so much that they sent their own soldiers to join in the looting, which was actually pretty handy, because the Hephtalites had wiped out the core of Iran's army ten years ago. This war lasted only a few years, but it ended with Rome finally agreeing to pay tribute to Iran. Kavadh had adopted the superior swords and bows of his Hephtalite allies, and built his broken army back into a power to be feared, but he had done so at the cost of reigniting Iran's age-old rivalry with Rome. The Romans now openly broke their prior treaty obligations. Both empires had previously agreed to stop building military fortifications on their shared border, as a gesture of good faith. But as soon as Kavadh got distracted by Turkic tribes invading through the Caucasian Gates, Anastasius bought every building in a small village called Dara, and rapidly built it into a shoddy little fort. When Kavadh turned back around and saw a fort where there had definitely not been a fort before, he asked, ""Hey, did you put that fort there?"", and Anastasius answered, ""Hmm, that? No no no, that's always been there. Here, take some gold, go fight your Turks or whatever."" Kavadh did have his hands full with the whole Turk situation, and then beating up his former Hephtalite allies, so it took him a while to get back to this Rome issue. By the time he finally did, things had changed. Anastasius had died without declaring an heir. An upstart pig farmer named Justin had stepped into his place, although all reports indicated that his nephew Justinian was the real brains behind the throne. Still, it was a stark reminder to the aging Kavadh that it was never too soon to choose an heir. The most obvious candidate was his eldest son Kawus, who not only had seniority, but currently served as a governor of a northern province. But Kawus was a fervent Mazdakite, and Kavadh had spent years now trying to distance himself from that whole mess. His second son had lost an eye, which technically disqualified him under Iranian rules of succession. And then there was Khosrau, his third son. His favourite. The one who had already made allies at court by denouncing the Mazdakites. Not a hard choice actually. But the Mazdakites remained a problem. Even without Kavadh's support, their goals of a classless society and equal distribution of wealth continued to win converts across the Empire. They were still vastly outnumbered by followers of traditional Zoroastrianism though, and a backlash eventually swelled against the Mazdakites and their radical ideas. Priests pushed to enforce official doctrine all across the Empire, even in the border territories, which Iran had traditionally allowed to do their own thing. For many of those territories, doing their own thing meant being Christian, so having Zoroastrian doctrines suddenly enforced on them did not go over very well. It all came to a head in 524 CE when one Iranian territory with a Christian king decided to defect to Rome. Kavadh reached out to Justin to see if they could resolve this peacefully. ""Justin, buddy. Hey, just a thought; maybe stop accepting our runaway territories into your empire and let's just be friends, okay? And hey, as a gesture of good faith to seal this friendship, I'll let you adopt Khosrau as your son!"" The adoption offer was mostly a formality. Khosrau was a grown man, he wasn't exactly going to move to Constantinople and start calling Justin dad. But the gesture could bring the two empires together; and Roman support could help Khosrau claim the throne when Kavadh died. In fact, the Iranians had done exactly the same thing for Rome in the fourth century, when a previous Shah had adopted the emperor's son to secure his succession. Kavadh felt that it was high time Rome returned that favour. Justin loved this idea. His advisors did not love it as much. They worried that this symbolic gesture might be the first step of a sneaky campaign to place Khosrau on the throne of the Roman Empire. They suggested, ""Maybe tone it down a little."" So ambassadors from both sides met on the border with Khosrau himself waiting in the wings. The Roman said, ""Great news! Our emperor will adopt you, but not as a Roman and an equal son. N-n-no, he's already got one of those. But, he will adopt you as a barbarian."" To which Khosrau responded, ""He can adopt my fist to his face!"" and went to war. The war started out great for Iran. Kicking the Romans up and down the frontier felt just like old times. By now though, Justin had died, and left the Empire in the hands of his ambitious nephew, who began an aggressive push to fortify more places along the border. The newly reinforced city of Dara, which Kavadh always knew would be trouble, handed Iran their first major loss. In the peace negotiations that followed, Kavadh insisted that the Romans pull down their fortifications at Dara, and start paying their fair share to defend the Caucasian Gates. He did not live to hear Justinian's response. Kavadh passed away in 531 CE, leaving a will that declared Khosrau should inherit his throne. The nobles quickly voted to confirm his choice, and at last, it was Khosrau's time to shine! But all the problems from his father's reign hit Khosrau at once. A new wave of invaders poured through the Caucasian Gates, and the Iranian army was still tied up in the war with Rome. Khosrau called on his brother Kawus, who still governed the province up north, to repel the invaders. Kawus took care of the problem quickly, but then claimed that his victory proved that maybe he should be Shah instead of Khosrau; and since Kawus was a Mazdakite, Mazdak and his followers immediately joined his cause. Khosrau needed his army back, which meant he needed to make peace with Justinian and recall the army from the borders of Rome. He invited Justinian's envoys into his court, but the envoys replied that they would not negotiate anything. Justinian had caught wind of Kawus' rebellion, and hoped to sow as much chaos into Iran as he could, so he refused to recognise Khosrau as the new Shah. Kawus came to Ctesiphon to press his claim to the throne, and Khosrau watched his allies begin slipping away. Most nobles refused to recognise his brother, but a few quietly began to switch sides. The Mazdakites had given Kawus a strong base of support, and Khosrau decided that he needed to take that support away. He invited Mazdak and his people to come to his palace without Kawus, promising to hear their demands. The invitation was a trap. As the Mazdakites entered his courtyard, Khosrau had them cut down. One story, which is probably just a story, but it goes to show how ruthless Khosrau was perceived to be, says that he planted their corpses upside down in his garden, and invited Mazdak to gaze upon these unique and beautiful trees. Then, he had Mazdak hanged from the gallows. Now that Kawus no longer had his most powerful ally, he was easy prey. Khosrau captured him and dragged him in front of the priests. He offered to set Kawus free if he begged forgiveness in front of all the holy men at court. Kawus replied that he prefered death to humiliation, and Khosrau obliged. Then he hunted down every one of Kawus' sons, and executed them before they could even think of avenging their father or stealing the throne. It was at this point that Khosrau returned his attention to Justinian's envoys, and informed them that he was now, without question, the Shah of Iran. Would they like to make peace with him now? Justinian decided that yes, he very much would. He handed over 11 thousand pounds of gold to pay for the defence of the Caucasian Gates, and withdrew his military base from Dara. But Khosrau would not forget or forgive this Roman Emperor for failing to support his succession. "
298,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,GUpaZ0hMso4," Last we left off, Shaka's boss Dingiswayo had just been killed at the hands of a man named Zwide. Shaka had declared vengeance against Zwide and his clan, the Ndwandwe and the Zulu had moved from being a tribe to a fledgling empire as Shaka consolidated control over the Mtethwa, Dingiswayo's powerful clan. Today, we look into the war between Shaka and Zwide and the disaster that followed in its wake. As Shaka took control of the Mtethwa tribe, he began to spread his ideas amongst them, teaching them how to fight in Zulu fashion and having them take on the Zulu name. He instilled in this newly consolidated Zulu clan a warrior culture that had never existed before and changed them from being pastoral herdsmen to conquerers. With this, Shaka began his frequently brutal expansion outward, bringing in neighboring tribes with diplomacy, when possible, but often resorting to the extremities of force. Unlike the ritual warfare of old, when his forces would engage in enemy bands, their goal was to destroy the enemy completely and when the forces under arms were destroyed he would march into the enemy village, often killing all the men of fighting age, assimilating only the women and children into the Zulu tribe. Finally, after training his people and expanding his reach, Shaka felt ready to take on Zwide. As Zwide's Ndwandwe forces pushed their way into what was now Zulu territory, Shaka ran a number of delaying tactics along the Umfolozi river while he moved his people and his cattle out of harms way. Then, he arrayed his forces, about five thousand strong, on a hill, right in the path of the oncoming Ndwandwe army. To the Ndwandwe, this looked like an easy victory. They had more than twice as many men as Shaka could muster and never before had one of the Zulu armies really been able to stand against them. Shaka, seeing his diasdvantage in numbers, split a small contingent from his force and used it to lure off a sizable portion of the enemy's army. But the Ndwandwe coming toward the hill still outnumbered him. This actually turned into an advantage for Shaka though. The Ndwandwe forces got in each others' way as they tried to clamber up the hill in a disorganized mob. This disorder, combined with the uphill ascent made the long throwing spears the Ndwandwe carried useless The Zulu counter-charged, rushing downhill and crashing into the enemy line with their short stabbing spears. The enemy routed, stampeding back down the hill. Shaka gathered his men back into formation at the top of the hill, and waited. Five times that day, the Ndwandwe charged the hill and five times, they were repulsed by the smaller force. As the day wore on, the Ndwandwe began to suffer from that great bane of armies in tropical climes: the heat. Ndwandwe men started to slip off to the river about a mile away. Meanwhile, every time the Ndwandwe fell back the Zulu warriors refreshed themselves with supplies Shaka had hidden atop the hill. The day was going well for Shaka, but even with his successes, his force was still outnumbered. Then, Shaka saw a signal fire in the distance. The diversionary force he had used to lure away a column of the Ndwandwe were letting him know that the contingent chasing them were on their way back. Shaka didn't have much time. He needed to shatter the Ndwandwe before the rest of their forces returned. But even though Zwide's men had been beaten back time and again, they had take a toll on the Zulu's numbers. Seeing this, Zwide marshalled his troops and prepared to lead them personally in one last grand assault. But Shaka was ready for it. All day, this entire time, he had only been fighting with two-thirds of his men. the chest and the horns of his bull's horn strategy. The other third, the loins, had been hidden in a depression behind the hill, rested and fresh. Now, he called on them to join the horns and envelop the enemy. Seeing this large force appear as if from nowhere, the Ndwandwe began to panic. Pinned by the chest and encircled by the horns, this last column of Ndwandwe was crushed, with its tattered remnants fleeing down the hill. Shaka sent a small contingent of men to kill any Ndwandwe they could find taking water at the river while his main force pursued the bulk of the fleeing army. But as the Ndwandwe column that had followed his diversionary force began to close in, Shaka was forced to give up the chase. The day was a bloody one. As was common in this new style of war, neither side took prisoners. As the sun set, nearly 2,000 Zulus lay dead, as did 7,500 Ndwandwe troops But their leader, Zwide, was not among them. Zwide was not well liked among the nearby tribes, and as cracks in the mighty Ndwandwe army began to show, Shaka was able to gain new allies, and new client states for his confederacy, bolstering his numbers. After eighteen more months of minor skirmishes, the final battle between the two forces came at the Mhlatuze River. As the Ndwandwe forces were trying to cross, the Zulu engaged, trapping half their forces on each side. Over the course of two days of running battle, the Ndwandwe forces were scattered. Seeing his opportunity, Shaka took his forces and marched on the Ndwandwe capital before word of their army's defeat could reach them. As he approached, before his men were close enough to be seen clearly from the capital, he had them start to sing Ndwandwe victory songs. Upon hearing the singing, the populace rushed out to greet them, only to be slaughtered by the oncoming forces. Zwide managed to escape, but his mother did not. Shaka locked her in a house with jackals and hyenas to eat her alive and when the night was done, he had the house burnt to the ground, so only ash would remain. Over the coming years, Shaka continued to expand his reach and assert Zulu dominance over all the tribes in the area. He turned his confederacy into a true empire, and exerted influence far beyond even the regions he could control. But all those tribes he had pushed out, all the fleeing refugees he had left behind, all the warriors he had driven from their homes, spread out like a fire across the savannah. All those men who had seen the Zulu fight adopted the Zulu way of war and as they fled the now mighty Zulu, they inflicted the same brutality on those around them. This was the mfecane, the crushing. These tribes that fled the Zulu either died out or formed kingdoms of their own with the same bloody tactics they had learned from the Zulu, and at an incredible price. Over the next 15 years, well over a million people would die as these refugees from the Zulu cut their way across the southern half of Africa. But by 1827, not all was right in the Zulu kingdom. Shaka's mother, the parent who had raised him, died, and he went mad with grief. Sources report him ordering that no grain be planted for a year, that any woman who got pregnant was to be executed along with her husband, that milk was not to be gathered from their cattle. It's said that he had 7,000 people killed for not grieving enough, that he had cows slaughtered so that their calves would know what it was like to lose a mother. It goes without saying that shortly after this, he was assassinated by his brothers. They'd been trying to get rid of him for some time anyway. But, as so often happens with these things, his two brothers shortly became one brother as there's just not enough room for two on the throne. And so, with two brothers bumped off in short succession, a man named Dingane became the leader of the Zulu empire. After either bribing or killing anybody still loyal to Shaka, Dingane faced a new threat: Dutch settlers, pushed east by the British colonial efforts in south Africa, began to enter Zulu land. At first, relations appeared cordial, with the Dutch helping to recover some 7000 cattle from Dingane's enemies in return for land in the Zulu territory. But when the Dutch came to Dingane's capital to sign the agreement, in the midst of a ceremonial dance, Dingane shouted to have them seized and dragged off to a nearby hill where they were all clubbed to death. Dingane then sent troops off to massacre the now undefended Dutch wagon train As is so often the case, none of this ends well for anybody. The Dutch sent out another wagon train, but this one full of nothing but fighters. In what's now known as the Battle of Bloody River, over ten thousand Zulus attacked the circled wagons of the Dutch, but with only their short spears to fight with, and on poor terrain, funneled into a killing plain, three thousand Zulus lay dead by the end of the day, and only three of the Dutch were even wounded. This battle broke the back of Dingane's forces. The last remaining half-brother of Dingane, who had fled with thousands of his followers, after seeing how Dingane treated the rest of his relatives now came storming back and the Dutch immediately became his allies. In the end he crushed Dingane, and he himself took over the leadership of the Zulu. He established a wary peace with the Dutch settlers, granting them land in return for their aid and began his reign in relative tranquility. Next week, we'll find out just how that peace turned out, and follow the lengthy reign of the new Zulu king, Mpande. "
299,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,GVU_zANtroE,"You breathe in about 17,000 times per day. It's a process you rarely think about, but behind the scenes, a huge coordinated effort is playing out. Your vital organs, the gut, brain, bones, lungs, blood, and heart work together to sustain your life by delivering oxygen to tissues throughout your body. Most of our cells need oxygen because it's one of the key ingredients of aerobic respiration. That's the process that produces a molecule called ATP, which our cells use to power their many incredible functions. But getting oxygen throughout our bodies is a surprisingly difficult task. Gas enters cells by diffusing in from their surroundings. And that only happens efficiently over tiny distances. So for oxygen to reach the cells within our bodies, it needs a transportation network. This is where our 20 trillion red blood cells come in. Each one contains about 270 million oxygen-binding molecules of hemoglobin, which is what gives blood its scarlet hue. To make these cells, the body uses raw materials that become available from the food we eat. So in some ways, you could say that oxygen's journey through the body really begins in the gut. Here, in an amazing display of mechanical and chemical digestion, food gets broken down into its smallest elements, like iron, the building block of hemoglobin. Iron is carried through the cardiovascular system to the body's hematopoietic tissue. This tissue is the birthplace  of red blood cells, and it can be found enclosed within our bone marrow cavities. The kidneys regulate  our levels of red blood cells through the release of erythropoietin, a hormone which causes marrow to increase production. Our bodies churn out roughly 2.5 million red blood cells per second, a number equivalent to the entire population of Paris, so that oxygen that makes it to the lungs will have ample transportation. But before oxygen  can even reach the lungs, the brain needs to get involved. The brainstem initiates breathing by sending a message through your nervous system, all the way to muscles of the diaphragm and ribs. This causes them to contract, thus increasing the space inside the rib cage, which allows the lungs to expand. That expansion drops your lungs internal air pressure, making air rush in. It's tempting to think of our lungs as two big balloons, but they're actually a lot more  complicated than that. Here's why. The red blood cells in the vessels within your lungs can only pick up oxygen molecules that are very close to them. If our lungs were shaped like balloons, air that was not in direct contact with the balloon's inner surface couldn't diffuse through. Luckily, our lungs' architecture ensures that very little oxygen is wasted. Their interior is divided into hundreds of millions of miniature balloon-like projections called alveoli that dramatically increase the contact area to somewhere around 100 square meters. The alveolar walls are made of extremely thin flat cells that are surrounded by capillaries. Together, the alveolar wall and capillaries make a two-cell thick membrane that brings blood and oxygen close enough for diffusion. These oxygen-enriched cells are then carried from the lungs through the cardiovascular network, a massive collection of blood vessels that reaches every cell in the body. If we laid this system out end to end in a straight line, the vessels would wrap around the Earth several times. Propelling red blood cells through this extensive network requires a pretty powerful pump, and that's where your heart comes in. The human heart pumps an average of about 100,000 times per day, and it's the powerhouse that ultimately gets oxygen where it needs to go, completing the body's team effort. Just think - this entire complex system is built around the delivery of tiny molecules of oxygen. If just one part malfunctioned, so would we. Breathe in. Your gut, brain, bones,  lungs, blood, and heart are continuing their incredible act of coordination that keeps you alive. Breathe out. "
300,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Ghbkv0MKV-w,"Meet Lucy. She was a math major in college, and aced all her courses in probability  and statistics. Which do you think is more likely: that  Lucy is a portrait artist, or that Lucy is a portrait artist  who also plays poker? In studies of similar questions, up to 80  percent of participants chose the equivalent  of the second statement: that Lucy is a portrait artist who also plays poker. After all, nothing we know about Lucy suggests an affinity for art, but statistics and probability are useful in poker. And yet, this is the wrong answer. Look at the options again. How do we know the first statement is more likely to be true? Because it’s a less specific version of the second statement. Saying that Lucy is a portrait artist doesn’t make any claims about what else she might or might not do. But even though it’s far easier to imagine her playing poker than making art based on the background information, the second statement is only true if she does both of these things. However counterintuitive it seems to imagine Lucy as an artist, the second scenario adds another condition on top of that, making it less likely. For any possible set of events, the likelihood of A occurring will always be greater than the likelihood of A and B both occurring. If we took a random sample of a million people who majored in math, the subset who are portrait artists might be relatively small. But it will necessarily be bigger than the subset who are portrait artists  and play poker. Anyone who belongs to the second group  will also belong to the first– but not vice versa. The more conditions there are, the less likely an event becomes. So why do statements with more conditions sometimes seem more believable? This is a phenomenon known as the conjunction fallacy. When we’re asked to make quick decisions, we tend to look for shortcuts. In this case, we look for what seems  plausible rather than what is statistically  most probable. On its own, Lucy being an artist doesn’t  match the expectations formed by the preceding information. The additional detail about her playing poker gives us a narrative that resonates  with our intuitions— it makes it seem more plausible. And we choose the option that seems more representative of the overall picture, regardless of its actual probability. This effect has been observed  across multiple studies, including ones with participants  who understood statistics well– from students betting on  sequences of dice rolls, to foreign policy experts predicting  the likelihood of a diplomatic crisis. The conjunction fallacy isn’t just a  problem in hypothetical situations. Conspiracy theories and false news stories often rely on a version of the conjunction fallacy to seem credible– the more resonant details are added  to an outlandish story, the more plausible it begins to seem. But ultimately, the likelihood a story is true can never be greater than the probability that its least likely component is true. "

She'd been born with the physical perfection so complete that she was worshipped as a new incarnation of Venus, the goddess of love. But real-life human lovers were too intimidated even to approach her. When her father asked for guidance from the Oracle of Apollo, the god of light, reason, and prophecy. He was told to abandon his daughter on a rocky crag where she would marry a cruel and savage serpent-like winged evil. Alone on the crag, Psyche felt Zephyr the West Wind gently lifting her into the air. It set her down before a palace. ""You are home,"" she heard  an unseen voice say. ""Your husband awaits you in the bedroom, if you dare to meet him."" She was brave enough, Psyche told herself. The bedroom was so dark that she couldn't see her husband. But he didn't feel serpent-like at all. His skin was soft, and his voice and manner were gentle. She asked him who he was, but he told her this was the one question he could never answer. If she loved him,  she would not need to know. His visits continued night after night. Before long, Psyche was pregnant. She rejoiced, but was also conflicted. How could she raise her baby with a man she'd never seen? That night, Psyche approached her sleeping husband holding an oil lamp. What she found was the god Cupid who sent gods and humans  lusting after each other with the pinpricks of his arrows. Psyche dropped her lamp, burning Cupid with hot oil. He said he'd been in love with Psyche ever since his jealous mother, Venus, asked him to embarrass the young woman by pricking her with an arrow. But taken with Psyche's beauty, Cupid used the arrow on himself. He didn't believe, however, that gods and humans could love as equals. Now that she knew his true form, their hopes for happiness were dashed, so he flew away. Psyche was left in despair until the unseen voice returned and told her that it was indeed possible for her and Cupid to love each other as equals. Encouraged, she set out to find him. But Venus intercepted Psyche and said she and Cupid could only wed if she completed a series  of impossible tasks. First, Psyche was told to sort a huge, messy pile of seeds in a single night. Just as she was abandoning hope, an ant colony took pity on her and helped with the work. Successfully passing the first trial, Psyche next had to bring Venus the fleece of the golden sheep, who had a reputation for  disemboweling stray adventurers, but a river god showed her how to collect the fleece the sheep had snagged on briars, and she succeeded. Finally, Psyche had to travel to the Underworld and convince Proserpina,  queen of the dead, to put a drop of her beauty in a box for Venus. Once again, the unseen voice came to Psyche's aide. It told her to bring barley cakes for Cerberus, the guard dog to the Underworld and coins to pay the boatman, Charon to ferry her across the river Styx. With her third and final task complete, Psyche returned to the land of the living. Just outside Venus's palace, she opened the box of Proserpina's beauty, hoping to keep some for herself. But the box was filled with sleep, not beauty, and Psyche collapsed in the road. Cupid, now recovered from his wounds, flew to his sleeping bride. He told her he'd been wrong and foolish. Her fearlessness in the face of the unknown proved that she was more than his equal. Cupid gave Psyche amborsia, the nectar of the gods, making her immortal. Shortly after, Psyche bore their daughter. They named her Pleasure, and she, Cupid, and Psyche,  whose name means soul, have been complicating people's love lives ever since. "
302,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,Gtlxbyzd7Vg,"For months, Catherine,  together with one of her lovers, had been working with men high  in government and the military to replace what they all saw as a disastrous  and incompetent emperor. Peter. They had slowly been putting out bribes and winning the hearts of the local guard regiments in St.Petersburg But on the night of June 27, it all came to a head, due to a slip of the tongue. [Intro Music] June 27, 1762 A soldier in one of the guard regiments  in St. Petersburg gets spooked. He turns to one of his officers and asks if it's true that the conspiracy against the emperor has been found out. Turns out the officer he just asked is one of the few who was not in on the plot. The soldier is arrested on the spot, as is one of the guard officers  who is central to the rebellion. The time is now,  or never. The revolt must begin. midnight of THE FIRST DAY - 24 hours remain - The principal conspirators gather, panicked. A man named Panin, a man who would go on to be one of Catherine's highest officials, stays them, saying their freedom could only be assured for a few hours, so they must act,  and they must act now. The brother of Catherine's paramour  is dispatched to Peterhof, the palace outside of St. Petersburg  where Catherine is staying. He dashes out and pulls aside  the first carriage he can find. Money makes the driver push the horses hard through the night. Meanwhile, Peter is asleep at Oranienbaum, a small post outside of Petersburg where he is staying to observe one of his regiments before his Danish adventure. dawn of THE FIRST DAY - 19 hours remain - The brother of Catherine's lover arrives  just as Catherine is waking, at 5 A.M. ""The time has come,"" he says. He quickly relays the night's event. Skipping all the elaborate dress  of a high lady of the time, Catherine immediately rushes  to the carriage. The horses are exhausted from the travel of the previous night, but, as they are crawling down the road toward the capital, a farm wagon on its way  to morning market passes. They stop it, and the empress' consort pushes money into the farmer's hand. She has his two great farm horses tethered to her carriage right then and there, and they speed toward St. Petersburg. Out in the drill yard, Peter is making his small contingent of Holstein soldiers parade before him. A messenger brings news of the arrest of the guards and the possible conspiracy. Peter shrugs it off. morning of THE FIRST DAY - 16 hours remain - One by one, Catherine goes to the barracks of each of the guard units stationed in Petersburg. One by one, the regiments swear fealty to her in a jubilus tumult. Meanwhile,  Peter is playing violin in his room. A man rushes in to tell him he has a message  about happenings in the capital. Annoyed at the interruption, Peter tells the man to put it on the table. He'll read it later. (He never does.) Surrounded by guards, a procession with Catherine at its center makes its way to the Cathedral  of Our Lady Kazan, where the archbishop of Novgorod pronounces her sovereign autocrat of Russia. Meanwhile, Peter orders a caravan  of carriages assembled to take him and his guest back  to Peterhof to have a feast. He forgets to order  the usual cavalry escort. afternoon of THE FIRST DAY -8 hours remain - Catherine  and an evergrowing mob precess to the Winter Palace. There she meets with assembled members of the Senate and the Holy Synod, the highest religious council  of Russia. She declares that, out of love for Russia and the Orthodox faith, she had been moved  to such action. That, at the urging of her subjects against an emperor who imperiled them, she took the throne to deliver Russia from foreign powers and foreign religion. Which, I mean, bold move considering she herself was a foreigner who had come to Russia with a foreign religion but, hey. Nobody was really sweating  the details at the time. Meanwhile, Peter's group of revellers arrive at Peterhof, only to find no one there. Peter is furious. He storms through the house,  looking for Catherine. She spoiled his party. To one of his entourage, he screams  in rage at her unthinking discourtesy. ""Did I always tell you  she was capable of anything!?"" A few of the more senior members of the party offered to head to St.&nbsp;Petersburg to see if they could find her. They had probably put two and two together by this point. evening of THE FIRST DAY  - 4 hours remain - The embassy  from Peter's company arrives. One of them begs Catherine not to take up arms against her husband. She takes him by the elbow and leads him to a balcony. Gesturing  to the ecstatic crowd, she says: ""Deliver your message to them."" The small group of messengers all swear fealty to Catherine, Or asked to be allowed to retire. Meanwhile, Peter has gotten  his first concrete news from all the goings on, from a crew of a firework barge that was sailing to Peterhof to provide fireworks for his party. But all their information is still vague, because they had left early in the morning, as they had been ordered to go deliver the fireworks. Peter, enraged, orders word to be sent to Oranienbaum  to get his Holstein regiment. He shouts that he would defend himself to the death. His men arrive and are posted along the road to the capital. But no one thought to tell them there might be a fight, so they only brought  their wooden parade ground rifles. A Russian uniform  is found for Peter, because he was still wearing the German one that he liked so much. His advisers gather around him. One counsels that he don the uniform, ride at full haste to the capital, and remind the people who they had sworn an oath to. Another recommends that he meet up  with a larger contingent of the army, 70 miles away,  and then march on Saint Petersburg. A third recommends he flee to Germany. He does nothing. Men are sent to secure a nearby island fortress. This fortress is still loyal. At least this was good news. night of THE FIRST DAY  - 2 hours remain - Catherine  had gotten the backing of the Senate, the people, the army and the Senate without firing a shot. But there was one last thing  she had to do. Peter had to formally abdicate. As was the right of the sovereign, She had taken on the rank of the kernel of the Preobrazhensky guards, borrowing pieces of a uniform  from any of the men who seemed about her size. She strode out to meet her soldiers  in the brilliant green of the guards. She would lead the final foray  to capture Peter, herself. As the March began, a young subaltern rushed up to give her his sword knot, the one piece her uniform yet lacked. This subaltern's name, by the way, was Gregory Potemkin. Peter, meanwhile,  chose to withdraw to the island fortress he had secured earlier in the evening. As his boat approached, the harbor  was closed off to him. He shouted to the men in the fort. ""Do you not know me,  I'm your Emperor"" To which the reply came: ""We no longer have an Emperor. Long live Empress Catherine the Second"". in the time between him sending his man to secure the fort and him choosing to finally go there, the top Admiral of the Navy had sworn allegiance to the new Empress, and headed to the fort to take over his command personally. Peter fled into his cabin to hide when he returned to Peterhof he dismissed everyone and then went  to his room, refusing to speak to his staff. Then he composed  a letter to Catherine, apologizing for his bad behavior and offering to share the throne with her. dawn of THE SECOND DAY At first light Catherine receives Peter's letter. She is unimpressed. A few hours later,  she receives another letter offering to abdicate if he could just go back to Holstein. She accepts. He writes an abject abdication statement detailing how unfit he is to rule. Needless to say a few weeks later, he wound up dead in a drunken brawl that was probably a cleverly disguised assassination. And his idol the man he kept telling himself he was equal to, Frederick the Great, of the affair,  Frederick merely said he allowed himself to be dethroned like a child being sent to bed. And while Catherine probably had nothing  to do with Peter being killed, she did pardon his killers, as his death freed her up to rule without the worry that someone would try and form a counter rebellion around him, and rule she did, rapidly reversing almost all of Peter's policies. As Russian forces were literally on the verge of engaging with Denmark, riders arrived  with Catherine's orders to return home. In fact, that was the order to all the Russian troops in Europe. She was going to begin an era of neutrality, where Russian troops fought on neither side of the Seven Years War, and for this the army was forever grateful. The church on the other hand was more complex. She put a temporary moratorium  on Peter's order to secularize all church land, but Catherine was intent on being an informed ruler, and as report came in to her,  every day one thing became more and more clear: Russia was broke. Grain prices were soaring,  the Treasury was filled with IOUs. Ending all the wars would help, but not seeing the reparations, which might have been expected with the decisive victory, Russia was penniless, and without any recourse to credit. And easily a tenth  of all the wealth of Russia was locked up in church lands: wealth that her government needed. After a long back-and-forth with the Senate about the morality of a church, which owned so much property but didn't help with the temporal affairs like charity and education, and with a few threats thrown in, Catherine was able to cow them. All church property became state property. More than a million Church serfs became peasants, which meant they now had to pay taxes. And all church officials became employees of the state. And this shows the strength of Catherine. Where Peter lost one of the great pillars of the Russian state, and arguably his throne for his policy, Catherine's iron will and careful management of the other elements of power allowed her to drag in this vast source of government revenue, but in doing so, it also brought up the other great issue for Catherine: serfs. Because serfs in Russia were slaves, they could be bought and sold, abused with no rights over their own bodies. They could be gambled away or traded. They had no choice but to work in the vocation their master chose for them, and they couldn't move or leave the land that they were bound to. And with the burgeoning Industrial Revolution, there came to be a new kind of serf: a serf not owned by a master, but owned by a corporation, many of whom were employed by the great mining enterprises of the Urals. And in these mines, life was ugly, brutish, and short. Because they were chattel, men were literally worked to death, beaten when they paused for a moment in their labor. This treatment caused riots and strikes that would eventually lead to the largest peasant revolt in Russian history. So join us next time for the plight of the serfs, the ghosts of Peter the third, and the Pugachev rebellion. ♪ "
303,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,GyN2RhbhiEU,"Chat with a friend about an established scientific theory and she might reply, ""Well, that's just a theory."" But a conversation about an established scientific law rarely ends with, ""Well, that's just a law."" Why is that? What is the difference  between a theory and a law, and is one better? Scientific laws and theories have different jobs to do. A scientific law predicts the results of certain initial conditions. It might predict your unborn  child's possible hair colors, or how far a baseball travels when launched at a certain angle. In contrast, a theory tries to provide the most logical explanation about why things happen as they do. A theory might invoke dominant and recessive genes to explain how brown-haired parents ended up with a red-headed child, or use gravity to shed light on the parabolic trajectory of a baseball. In simplest terms, a law predicts what happens while a theory proposes why. A theory will never grow up into a law, though the development of one often triggers progress on the other. In the 17th century, Johannes Kepler theorized cosmic musical harmonies to explain the nature of planetary orbits. He developed three brilliant laws of planetary motion while he was studying decades  of precise astronomical data in an effort to find support  for his theory. While his three laws are still in use today, gravity replaced his theory of harmonics to explain the planets' motions. How did Kepler get part of it wrong? Well, we weren't handed  a universal instruction manual. Instead, we continually propose, challenge, revise, or even replace our scientific ideas  as a work in progress. Laws usually resist change since they wouldn't have been adopted if they didn't fit the data, though we occasionally revise laws  in the face of new unexpected information. A theory's acceptance, however, is often gladiatorial. Multiple theories may compete to supply the best explanation of a new scientific discovery. Upon further research, scientists tend to favor the theory  that can explain most of the data, though there may still  be gaps in our understanding. Scientists also like when a new theory successfully predicts previously unobserved phenomena, like when Dmitri Mendeleev's theory about the periodic table predicted several undiscovered elements. The term scientific theory covers a broad swath. Some theories are new ideas with little experimental evidence that scientists eye with suspicion, or even ridicule. Other theories, like those involving the Big Bang, evolution, and climate change, have endured years  of experimental confirmation before earning acceptance by the majority  of the scientific community. You would need to learn more about a specific explanation before you'd know how well  scientists perceive it. The word theory alone doesn't tell you. In full disclosure, the scientific community has bet on the wrong horse before: alchemy, the geocentric model, spontaneous generation, and the interstellar aether are just a few of many theories  discarded in favor of better ones. But even incorrect theories  have their value. Discredited alchemy was the birthplace of modern chemistry, and medicine made great strides long before we understood the roles of bacteria and viruses. That said, better theories often lead to exciting new discoveries that were unimaginable under the old way of thinking. Nor should we assume all of our current scientific theories will stand the test of time. A single unexpected result is enough to challenge the status quo. However, vulnerability to some potentially better explanation doesn't weaken a current scientific theory. Instead, it shields science from becoming unchallenged dogma. A good scientific law  is a finely-tuned machine, accomplishing its task brilliantly but ignorant of why it works as well as it does. A good scientific theory is a bruised, but unbowed, fighter who risks defeat if unable to overpower or adapt to the next challenger. Though different, science needs both laws and theories to understand the whole picture. So next time someone comments that it's just a theory, challenge them to go nine rounds with the champ and see if they can do any better. "
304,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,HIs5B2U7US0,"The year is 1095 CE. We stand at the Council of Clermont. In the audience are all the great names of Europe, both secular and ecclesiastical. For a moment there's a hush. The last words of Pope Urban II's fiery speech, extolling nations of Christendom to retake the holy land from Muslim invaders, hangs in the air. Then someone in the crowd shouts ""Deus vult"", ""God wills it"". The chant is picked up by man after man until the council rings with deafening shouts of ""Deus vult"". Then, out of the crowd, a bishop named Adhemar rushes up and falls to his knees before the Pope, claiming that he will lead any willing Christian to reclaim the holy land for Christ. And thus,  the First Crusade began. There's just a few problems. You see, by this point Muslims had actually occupied the Holy Land for nearly 400 years and there was little evidence  of the various atrocities Urban invoked in his speech to incite Europe to crusade. In fact, the church had never seemed very concerned about the occupation before now and pilgrimages to the holy land had continued practically uninterrupted since Jerusalem fell  into Muslim hands in 637. So what was really going on ? Well, earlier that year, Alexius Comnenus, the Emperor of the Byzantine Empire, an empire that had fallen a long way since the days of Justinian, had sent envoys to the Pope asking for help from the West against the Seljuq Turks. These Turkish Muslims coming out of the East had practically pushed the Empire to its limits, forcing them out of nearly  all of Anatolia, the traditional heartland of his empire. Alexius Comnenus had hoped for supplies, arms, and a few thousand well-trained men so that Byzantium could continue to serve as the bulwark of Christian Europe  against the Muslim east or really so he could just win this war retake his territory and strengthen the Empire he was the head of. But you know,  it's all in how you sell it. Well, Pope Urban  had a slightly different idea. You see, the Pope wasn't in the most secure position. The church was basically at war with the Holy Roman Emperor. Another pope named Clement III had been installed in Ravenna and claimed to be the rightful Pope. In fact Urban couldn't  even enter Rome. Hence why he was kicking around in France : because the Holy Roman Emperor and the antipope  held it against him. So Urban thought: ""Maybe let's unite all of Christendom  to fight somebody else"" Of course he never really asked for Alexius Comnenus' opinion on the this plan but we'll deal with that more later. And thus the First Crusade began. But Urban was a smart guy, he knew how to motivate people. He knew how to gather a force larger and more cohesive than any nation in Europe could muster. He would offer to those who have spent their life fighting, those who had spent their lives committing mortal sins, one chance, one opportunity for absolution. And he would offer that opportunity for doing the thing they did best: going to war. This is the first time a pope had ever done this. Never before had a plenary indulgence been offered for Marshall action, and this innovation drew a lot of people. And truth is: though  I may have my suspicions about some of the motivations of the leaders of this movement, In a world as motivated  by faith as medieval Europe I think that faith and a hope  for absolution was the reason that so many people bankrupt themselves  just so they could join the crusade. But unfortunately, this offer was so good that a lot of people who signed up weren't quite the people the Pope meant to get. You see, the Pope had set  a date of August 1096 for the Crusaders to leave from Europe so that nights and barons could get their affairs in order and so that they could prepare what in the Middle Ages counted as supply and logistics. But that wasn't fast enough for some people. In France, there was a fellow  by the name of Peter the Hermit who began whipping up the peasantry he talked of the atrocities he'd witnessed in the Holy Land. (Although there's a fair amount of evidence to say that he never actually went there) And he told tales of his divine appointment by Christ to lead the spiritually pure who would be protected by heaven to Jerusalem. Tens of thousands of people left their farms to join Peter, although they had no money for the journey and didn't even know how far it was from their homes in Western Europe to the levant. Few of them where soldiers, and fewer still even owned weapons. But as Peter preached, word of this peasants crusade began. And while Peter was still gathering his tide of peasants at Cologne, Other groups decided that they were just going to set out on their own. And this is where the people's crusade becomes one of the most unmitigated messes in the history of History. First there's the group from France under a fellow named Walter Sans-Avoir. They left ahead of Peter and made it  through Hungary all right, but when they showed up at Belgrade, The doorstep of the Byzantine Empire, the local governor was very confused. He'd been told that the Crusaders weren't supposed to show up for another half a year at least. And weren't they supposed  to be soldiers? This was just a mob led by a few impoverished knights. So he didn't let them in. He told them he was gonna send a letter back to Constantinople and could they please just wait patiently until he got his instructions in order ? How do they respond? By pillaging the countryside! In all fairness to the Crusaders, they were probably starving. They hadn't thought to bring many supplies with them, and you've got to remember : this is spring in medieval Europe, it's not like they had refrigeration and rapid transport. The bulk of the food for the year comes in during the fall harvest which is exactly why Urban scheduled his crusade to start in the middle of august, so it could be easy to resupply as they went. But by springtime there's just not very much food around So it's unlikely the Crusaders had been able to really stock up on spare provisions on their trek through Hungary So the Crusaders went on a pillaging spree. They destroyed homes and farms they even came to blows with the local byzantine garrison. Some of them even went back to Hungary, which they've managed to cross through before without doing any harm, and tried to loot a local market. They tried... but the town's folk kick them out and the local byzantine garrison beat them down too and soon cowed, these first Crusaders were brought under escort to Constantinople we'll catch up with them in a bit when Peter gets there. But first we should talk about the second splinter group of the people's crusade : a group from Germany led by count Emicho of Leiningen. This count had heard of Peters preachings, and had gathered his own group to go crusade. They were to head off to the Holy Land from Germany but - well they only got a few miles before they seem to decide that : ""you know, the local Jews are a lot closer and less well-armed !"" And so they went from town to town through Germany sacking their own cities slaughtering the jewish population and stealing any money they might find. Now this was opposed almost unilaterally by the Catholic Church this wasn't at all what urban had called for. Even if you argue he didn't care about Jews there's no question he wanted the fighting out of Christendom at the very least not only did priests and monks preach against this sort of violence but there are actually heroic stories of Bishops opposing these marauding Crusaders and trying to protect their local Jewish communities. The Bishop of Speyer gave them his protection. The Bishop of worms brought the local Jews to take refuge in his home and even tried to fortify the place but the Christian Crusaders attack and stormed the bishops house slaughtering some 800 Jews hiding there. The Bishop of Menz did the same and even ordered the town bar against the Crusaders. In fact, there the local Jewish population even raised a great deal of gold to give Emicho if you would just go away. But Emicho took the bribe and then attach the city anyway. When word of the attack reached him the bishop raised his personal guard and rushed to join forces with the governor's militia and the force of local purchases who had come out armed to defend the local jewish population. After fierce fighting, the locals drove the Crusaders off. But the Crusaders gathered more men recruited some sympathetic or bribable town's folk, and attacked again. This time the defenders broke and fled. In the aftermath thousands of Jews were slaughtered. Emicho's band massacred their way through Germany until at last they ended up at the Hungarian border. By this time Peter and his crusade had already passed through Hungary (we'll talk about how their trip went next time). But when the king of Hungary saw Emicho's marauding band he decided that : Nope, he was having none of this. And refuse to let them into his country. The Crusaders decided to force their way in anyway and promptly laid siege to the Hungarian, Christian, city of Moson, where they were promptly defeated by the city garrison and slaughtered almost to a man. And thus the First Crusade began. Join us next time to find out what happens to Peter's band of itinerant peasants find out what the Pope and the nobles were doing all this time and watch the First Crusade begin in earnest "

He's carried this book all 1,000 loose pages of it through harsh terrain and bandit country that it survived to this point is a minor miracle and now he's finally sending it to its intended recipient the king of Spain so Guaman Poma de Ayala takes the only copy of his life's work and hands it to a man aboard a ship No one will see it again for 300 years When you get off the plane the first Thing you notice is how thin the air is and as you exit the airport a man in a poncho offers you a Styrofoam cup full of coca leaf tea to help you deal with the Andean altitude and your hotel has oxygen tanks in the lobby Cusco sits at nearly three thousand four hundred meters or eleven thousand two hundred feet in altitude when you walk the cobblestone streets you feel dizzy and have to stop for a breath after a few blocks and Then you start to notice something strange Every large Spanish building in the city has been built on a foundation of Incan stone That's because the Spanish didn't build Cusco they merely built on top of it it was in fact the Inca who despite the altitude built a city here and Not just any city mind you a city that ruled the largest indigenous Empire to ever exist in the Americas the Inca Empire spanned 2500 miles along the Pacific coast of South America Stretching from present-day Colombia to Chile and it ruled as many as 12 million people but sheer numbers can't really convey What an impressive feat that was because the Inca also controlled some of the most varied and harsh terrain on the planet Ranging from snow-capped mountains to the humid Amazonian jungle to the Atacama Desert parts of which haven't seen rain in nearly 400 years Walk the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu a fairly short route You can still follow today and he'll pass dusty valleys lush agricultural terraces alpine tundra and Jungle, the massive andes themselves create these micro environments forcing the moisture out of passing cloud formations So part of the inca heartland remain wet while earth in the other areas. Stay powder dry in fact many settlements stand at altitudes that are difficult to breathe in for anyone but the Andeans whose lungs have adapted to absorb more oxygen actually After building all of these celebratory churches on the foundations of the Incan capital of Cusco the Spanish moved the capital to Lima partially because they couldn't handle the altitude but Despite the complexity of ruling over and building in such varied environments The masonry of the Inca highway cuts through all of them at times tunneling through solid rock winding its way through ruins of settlements, fortresses, Terraces and temples and the Inca built this sophisticated state without iron tools the wheel riding or draught animals money or a written language However, they did have quipu, a series of knotted ropes that help them calculate complex equations and remember numbers and dates but the rest of their culture their folklore their religion and their history was all Oral, which becomes a bit of a problem when it comes to telling the history of the Inca Empire Because while the conquest is well documented We have no sources from before the period of the Spanish conquest Like the buildings of Cusco where Spanish constructions stand on inca foundations all of our stories of the Empire Come to us to one extent or another via their colonizers following the Spanish conquest dozens of priests Administrators and former conquistadors set to work interviewing native people in order to capture the Empire's oral history and while these accounts are better than nothing their usefulness is mixed at best See after the fall of the Inca Empire a struggle began over the Empire's cultural legacy Spanish authorities stripped the valuables from shrines leveled temples suppressed native religious practices and Confiscated the Imperial mummies and the part of that campaign Involved collecting and telling the Incas oral histories some of the priests collected these stories in hopes It would assist in conversion but many considered the Inca devil worshipers or wrote specifically to make their rule appear illegitimate justifying the Spanish conquest conversely more sympathetic accounts came from Conquistadors who married into the inca elite and had a closer relationship with the culture but these two can display a major gap in understanding even after living in Peru for decades the Spanish didn't really Understand the Inca or any of the other people who lived under the Empire's banner Their ideas about religion society and politics were just too different for these chroniclers to capture accurately For example, the Inca didn't perceive history in a linear fashion to tell the history of their four province Empire They wouldn't start at the beginning They'd tell the history of the most important province beginning to end before moving on to the neck Most important and so on and it's from one of these Spanish accounts that we get the date of the Empire's founding But even that is controversial and maybe entirely wrong the closest we have to a native perspective comes mostly from a generation of mixed-race authors the sons of marriages between Inca noble women and their Spanish conquerors all Christians who were born after the Empire's destruction among them was blas fira a mixed-race jesuit whose pro inca views especially those about native languages being suitable for discussing church doctrine may have led his order to Imprison then exile him to Spain eventually He was murdered and his work burned during an English pirate raid Only a few excerpts remain from his history mostly in the work of another half Inca chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega who wrote extensively on the Empire's history but while vega's book Royal commentaries of the Incas is considered the first literary masterpiece by a Native American It has problems as a work of history because you see Vega left Peru as a teenager and published his chronicles forty-nine years later Meaning his memory of the oral history had likely degraded not to mention He was writing with a specific objective in mind while Guam and Poma rallied against Spanish abuses and Valera pushed for indigenous language and culture to be seen as equal Vega portrayed the Inca Empire as a Perfect society one without poverty where aristocrats like his family provided everything a person would need in Fact it appears that this mode of argumentative history was a hallmark of Andean culture to the Incas It seems history was not necessarily about capturing reality in a fully accurate picture But rather in molding the past to make a specific point, for example the Spanish found multiple Incan families in Cusco told elaborate but conflicting versions of the same history each using it to Justify their claim to a piece of land and as a result of these conflicting testimonies modern historians have come to vastly different conclusions about the Empire depending how they read the sources and because of this Incan society has been portrayed as everything from a communist utopia to a Totalitarian nightmare and details of the Empire's founding continue to be debated But the history's paired with archeology do tell us this in the early 13th century a line of kings began Coalescing around what would become the city of Cuzco? Manco capac the semi-mythical founder and as the legends say one of the first people to walk the earth Established the kingdom of cuzco before turning to stone Then came his successors each taking the ruling title of Sapa Inca each named for their greatness in Construction and war and they each took names that matched their glory and were also pretty baller if I do say so myself Such as the valorous generous Inca the left-handed the splendid accountant the Magnanimous and my personal favorite he who weeps blood they built the city and expanded their territory creating the Inca ways of life and bringing order to a chaotic world or Perhaps not because archaeological evidence indicates that many of the things we consider Incan accomplishments their farming terraces building style Agricultural products statecraft roads and knotted quipu were actually inherited from previous Andean societies But regardless of their source the Inca were about to use these tools on a scale No one had ever seen because in Cusco the Sapa Inca had a son He was not the oldest nor the favorite of his father, but he was intelligent brave and with a ruthless vision He had a birth name but that is not how he would be known. He would be known as the earth shaker Pachacuti first emperor of the Inca and a man who would remake the world in Cataclysm Special thanks to educational tier patrons Ovid Xia Turk Joseph blame and Gerald Spencer diamond "

Eleven-inch shells scream toward the Polish garrison holding the peninsula. Troops hit the dirt. A brick wall smashes inward. A radioman transmits to the next base along the coast: &lt;i&gt;""SOS. Under fire.”&lt;/i&gt; Bullets tear past. A Polish soldier falls - the first combat casualty of a new world war. There are German troops coming through the break in the wall. The Poles open fire, catching the invaders in a kill zone, forcing them back. Only 182 Polish soldiers defend this peninsula. They're under attack from a battleship, dive bombers, field artillery and nearly a division's worth of German soldiers. Even the local police have thrown in with the Nazis. But they'll hold for as long as they can. This series is brought to you by World of Tanks PC. Check out the game at the link below and use the invite code ORLIK for extra goodies. Mokra, Southern Poland 6:30 AM They must have crossed the border by now, the cavalrymen think. Nearly 10% of the Polish Army is cavalry. Modern cavalry! Cavalry that fights on foot, using horses to reposition and scout. Cavalry that tows antitank guns behind them. Cavalry that's dug into a line of trees outside the town of Mokra, along with an infantry division and a battalion of TKS tankettes... ...waiting to meet the invasion. Waiting is the hardest part. The first Germans they see are motorcycle scouts. The sides exchange fire, probing. An hour later the armour emerges. It's the 4th Panzer Division, pressing forward with 25 Panzer I and IIs, firing on the move. Autocannons set the thatched roofs of Mokra alight. The cavalry holds fire until the panzers close, then answer with their antitank guns. Half-dozen tanks slew, burning, grinding to a halt. Polish machine guns drive back the supporting infantry. They've stopped the first wave. Then comes another, and another. House-to-house fighting breaks out in the village. German armour and motorised infantry press close to the Polish positions. Air strikes and artillery pound the woods. With a blast of steam, an iron behemoth pulls out of the trees... The Poles' backup, Armored Train No. 53. Its twin cannons and machine guns open up. Twelve German tanks go out of action. The 4th Panzer regroups and attacks again. Warsaw. Another crash rattles the window. German dive bombers have been hitting Warsaw since 8:00 AM. Edward Rydz-Śmigły, Marshal of Poland, looks at his map. Things are going as well as they can be, under the circumstances. Germany is invading Poland from three of its borders: North, south, and west. The enemy has around 53 divisions, while Rydz-Śmigły has 40 - if that. But at least in these early hours, the Polish defensive lines are holding. In some places, better than that. At Mokra, the defenders report a hundred German vehicles destroyed. There are problems, of course. But he has one big advantage: he doesn't need to win. Polish strategy rested on two major pieces of diplomacy. The first was a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, securing the country's eastern border and allowing the Polish Army to prepare for the possibility of a German invasion. After all, Poland couldn't fight a two-front war. The second was a mutual defence pact: signed agreements with France and Britain to aid Poland in the event of a German invasion. As a sweetener, Rydz-Śmigły had even given them Poland's most prized secret: they'd cracked the German Enigma codes and reverse-engineered a machine. He'd given each ally a copy of it earlier that year. It was a sound strategy. In order to invade Poland, Hitler would need to strip divisions from the German homeland, leaving only a token force on his western border. If Germany violated Polish borders, the agreement stated, France would invade from the west, forcing Hitler to withdraw his troops and allowing Poland to counterattack. Britain would provide bombing support. But for the treaty to take effect, the invasion of Poland had to be contested, the Germans couldn't just walk in, as they had in Czechoslovakia. As a result, Rydz-Śmigły had been forced to spread his troops thin, ensuring that wherever the Germans crossed the border they'd be met with resistance. His plan called for the Polish Army to buy time with a fighting withdrawal and regroup near Warsaw, ready to strike once France mobilised and intervened. But he still didn't have enough troops and it was his allies' fault. Every time Hitler made threats, Rydz-Śmigły had tried to sound the mobilisation, but every time, Britain and France shut him down. A mobilisation would give Hitler an excuse to invade, they said. And they continued saying so even as German troops gathered on the border. Even the week before, when Germany signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviets, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, they'd preached restraint. Two days ago Rydz-Śmigły had enough and sounded general mobilisation, but the British forced him to rescind it. Now Hitler had made his own excuse, staging a fake attack on a radio station and blaming it on Polish partisans. So much for provocation. Luckily, Rydz-Śmigły had been secretly mobilising troops for weeks, calling them up for ""summer manoeuvres” as a cover story. It wasn't enough, but it gave him an army. And that was a good thing, because as a result of diplomatic pressure, the Polish army hadn't openly mobilised until a day before the invasion. Now just half the army had reached their positions, and only a fraction of those were combat ready. Poland was vastly outnumbered, facing a mechanised opponent with more modern equipment. The Luftwaffe's yearly budget was larger than all Polish defence spending since 1935. Germany had produced 800 tanks in 1938 - Poland made fifty. But at least those fifty tanks were good tanks. Eighty-seven percent of German armour consisted of Panzer Is and IIs, thin-skinned training tanks outfitted for combat. Poland's new 7TP matched the Panzer I and II for armour, while sporting a larger long-ranged Bofors gun. The old Polish TKS Tankettes could do little against German armour, but the 7TPs might make some difference if they made it to the battlefield. Still, at least things were going well... for now. September 2nd. Things are not going well anymore. By the second day, it's clear that the highly mobile tactics the Germans had field-tested in the Spanish Civil War, what others would later call Blitzkrieg, are outmanoeuvring and penetrating the Polish defence. Regular army units stand their ground, but the national guard constantly withdraws in poor order, creating gaps in the line. The Polish Army tries to make up lost ground in night operations, but the fatigue of constant battle offsets any gains. Polish troops fight, day and night, for three days straight. And the roads are nearly impassable. Refugees choke every roadway, getting in the way of troop movements, raving about Nazi liquidation squads operating behind the German lines. Dive bombers enhance the chaos, attacking soldiers and civilians alike. Communication begins breaking down, the army doesn't have enough radios. Tanks have to communicate with signal flags, meanwhile German armour executes precise encirclements, coordinated via wireless. On September 3rd, Britain and France declare war on Germany. But by then, German forces were precariously close to Warsaw. But at least the 7TPs finally arrive. September 5th Piotrków, 10:30 AM It's the last opportunity to stall the German advance in the south. Polish troops are retreating to regroup around Warsaw, but if the 4th Panzer Division takes this road hub, the door to the capital will stand open. The day before, the 7TPs of the Polish 2nd Light Tank Battalion had their first skirmish with the Panzer II, and had taught the German tankers to fear their 37mm Bofors cannon. Now, the Germans are closing on Piotrków with tanks and motorised infantry. But there's a chance, just a chance, to cut off the bulge in the German line. To take prisoners. To surround them. It was time to counterattack. Major Karpow, commander of the 2nd Light Tank Battalion orders the advance. They surge forward on either side of the German push, using the low hills for cover - and close to 500 metres. The lead 7TP sights in. The industrial chung of the gun fills the turret with acrid smoke. They fire again. A Panzer II burns. Autocannon rounds slap the TP7's glacis, failing to penetrate. The Germans armour runs for the woods. On the other flank, 7TPs tear through Panzers and armoured cars. Germans bail out of the burning craft. The 7TPs encircle them. The 1st Light Tank Battalion strikes in the north, engaging a dozen tanks as they push toward the junction. But German artillery shells begin to drop, and there's no one following behind the 7TPs to exploit their breakthrough. The German spearhead, though mauled, is still heading for Piotrków. Major Karpow calls a withdrawal. In two days of fighting, his 2nd Light Tank Battalion has destroyed 17 Panzers, two self-propelled guns, and fourteen armoured cars. During just this attack, Polish armour had destroyed 15 German tanks with the loss of only seven of their own. But that doesn't matter. There are no Polish units ready or able to exploit the victory. The plan remains to retreat toward Warsaw, so that's what they'll do. September 7th Warsaw. Marshal Rydz-Śmigły gathers his documents. Command staff haul radios and charts. They're evacuating to Brest along with the rest of the government. Plans call for making Warsaw a citadel, a stone for the Germans to break their teeth on. But he and the rest of the government cannot be killed in that assuredly bitter combat. The French are already massing on Germany's western border. Soon, he'll be managing a counterattack. He leaves a small communications team to forward messages on to his new headquarters. He has no idea how mangled the lines of communication are, how little he will know once he relocates, and how impossible it will be to transmit orders. The Polish Army, already hard-pressed, is about to lose touch with its leadership. The next day, the 4th Panzer Division reaches Warsaw. Inside, soldiers set up concealed artillery. Civilians dig trenches, planning to trap German tanks and torch them with cans of gasoline. Warsaw is preparing for a siege. Thanks World of Tanks PC for sponsoring this series.

Well, how much would you  pay for this house, or partial ownership of a website that sells pet supplies? At different points in time, tulips, real estate and stock in pets.com have all sold for much more than they were worth. In each instance, the price rose and rose and then abruptly plummeted. Economists call this a bubble. So what is exactly is going on  with a bubble? Well, let's start with the tulips to get a better idea. The 17th century saw the Netherlands enter the Dutch golden age. By the 1630s, Amsterdam was an important port and commercial center. Dutch ships imported spices from Asia in huge quantities to earn profits in Europe. So Amsterdam was brimming with wealthy,  skilled merchants and traders who displayed their prosperity  by living in mansions surrounded by flower gardens. And there was one flower in particularly high demand: the tulip. The tulip was brought to Europe on trading vessels that sailed from the East. Because of this, it was considered an exotic flower that was also difficult to grow, since it could take years for a single tulip to bloom. During the 1630s, an outbreak of tulip breaking virus made select flowers even more beautiful by lining petals with multicolor, flame-like streaks. A tulip like this was scarcer than a normal tulip and as a result, prices for these flowers started to rise, and with them, the tulip's popularity. It wasn't long before the tulip became a nationwide sensation and tulip mania was born. A mania occurs when there is an upward movement of price combined with a willingness  to pay large sums of money for something valued much lower in intrinsic value. A recent example of this is the dot-com mania of the 1990s. Stocks in new, exciting websites were like the tulips of the 17th century. Everybody wanted some. The more people who wanted the tulip, the higher the price could go. At one point, a single tulip bulb sold for more than ten times the annual salary of a skilled craftsman. In the stock market, the price of stock is based on the supply  and demand of investors. Stock prices tend to rise when it seems like a company will earn more in the future. Investors might then buy more of the stock, raising the prices even further due to an increased demand. This can result in a feedback loop where investors get caught up in the hype and ultimately drive prices  far above intrinsic value, creating a bubble. All that is needed for a mania to end and for a bubble to burst is the collective realization  that the price of the stock, or a tulip, far exceeds its worth. That's what happened with both manias. Suddenly the demand ended. Prices were pushed to staggering lows, and pop! The bubbles burst, and the market crashed. Today, scholars work long and hard trying to predict what causes a bubble and how to avoid them. Tulip mania is an effective illustration of the underlying principles at work in a bubble and can help us understand  more recent examples like the real estate bubble  of the late 2000s. The economy will continue to go through phases of booms and busts. So while we wait for the next mania to start, and the next bubble to burst, treat yourself to a bouquet of tulips and enjoy the fact that you didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for them. "
308,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,I5lsuyUNu_4,"To someone first encountering the works of William Shakespeare, the language may seem strange. But there is a secret to appreciating it. Although he was famous for his plays, Shakespeare was first and foremost a poet. One of the most important things  in Shakespeare's language is his use of stress. Not that kind of stress, but the way we emphasize certain syllables in words more than others. We're so used to doing this that we may not notice it at first. But if you say the word slowly, you can easily identify them. Playwright, computer, telephone. Poets are very aware of these stresses, having long experimented with the number and order of stressed  and unstressed syllables, and combined them in different ways to create rhythm in their poems. Like songwriters, poets often express their ideas through a recognizable repetition of these rhythms or poetic meter. And like music, poetry has its own set of terms  for describing this. In a line of verse, a foot is a certain number  of stressed and unstressed syllables forming a distinct unit, just as a musical measure consists of a certain number of beats. One line of verse is usually made up of several feet. For example, a dactyl is a metrical  foot of three syllables with the first stressed, and the second and third unstressed. Dactyls can create lines that move swiftly and gather force, as in Robert Browning's poem,  ""The Lost Leader."" ""Just for a handful of silver he left us. Just for a rib and to stick in his coat."" Another kind of foot is the two-syllable long trochee, a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed one. The trochees in these lines from Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"" lend an ominous and spooky tone to the witches' chant. ""Double, double, toil and trouble; fire burn and cauldron bubble."" But with Shakespeare, it's all about the iamb. This two-syllable foot  is like a reverse trochee, so the first syllable is unstressed and the second is stressed, as in, ""To be, or not to be."" Shakespeare's favorite meter, in particular, was iambic pentameter, where each line of verse is made up of five two-syllable iambs, for a total of ten syllables. And it's used for many  of Shakespeare's most famous lines: ""Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?"" ""Arise fair sun, and kill the envious moon."" Notice how the iambs cut across both punctuation and word separation. Meter is all about sound, not spelling. Iambic pentameter may sound technical, but there's an easy way to remember what it means. The word iamb is pronounced just like the phrase, ""I am."" Now, let's expand that to a sentence that just happens  to be in iambic pentameter. ""I am a pirate with a wooden leg."" The pirate can only walk in iambs, a living reminder  of Shakespeare's favorite meter. Iambic pentameter is when he takes ten steps. Our pirate friend can even help us remember how to properly mark it if we image the footprints he leaves walking along a deserted island beach: A curve for unstressed syllables, and a shoe outline for stressed ones. ""If music be the food of love, play on."" Of course, most lines  of Shakespeare's plays are written in regular prose. But if you read carefully, you'll notice that Shakespeare's characters turn to poetry, and iambic pentameter in particular, for many of the same reasons  that we look to poetry in our own lives. Feeling passionate, introspective, or momentous. Whether it's Hamlet pondering his existence, or Romeo professing his love, the characters switch to iambic pentameter when speaking about their emotions and their place in the world. Which leaves just one last question. Why did Shakespeare choose  iambic pentameter for these moments, rather than, say, trochaic hexameter or dactylic tetrameter? It's been said that iambic pentameter  was easy for his actors to memorize and for the audience to understand because it's naturally suited to the English language. But there might be another reason. The next time you're in a heightened  emotional situation, like the ones that make  Shakespeare's characters burst into verse, put your hand over  the left side of your chest. What do you feel? That's your heart beating in iambs. Da duhm, da duhm, da duhm, da duhm, da duhm. Shakespeare's most poetic lines don't just talk about matters of the heart. They follow its rhythm. "
309,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,I6vn6uRlPL8,"*intro* Thanks to Theodora, the vulnerable Justinian hadn't been assassinated or supplanted, and he still had an empire to wake up to; but some of his enemies had kept busy during his long sleep The plague had left a permanent scar on the Byzantine Empire: nearly a quarter of its citizens lay dead, crops had failed, trade had ground to a halt, and imperial revenue simply hadn't come in. The short-term consequences of this were apparent to anybody who saw the mass graves, but the long-term effects ran still deeper. In Italy, the Gothic tribes had rebelled, having felt cheated by Belisarius' betrayal; and unhappy with Roman rule, the tribe seized the opportunity to rearm and prepare for war, as plague gripped and weakened the hobbled Empire. The signs had been obvious, and yet the Byzantines had done nothing. The Gothic leadership had even squabbled and fought, leaving them vulnerable and weak; and yet the Byzantines had done nothing. Why? Because they had been even more divided. The attention of the imperial court had been entirely on the East: first on the Persians and then on the plague, and so there'd been little direct oversight of Italy. Meanwhile, the question of overall command had never been settled, and so instead, dozens of Byzantine commanders operated quasi-independently across the Italian Peninsula. This all meant that when the Goths had finally settled their differences, and come together under a man named Totila, Italy was ripe for the conquest. As the Gothic forces swept south, the towns, which were under-garrisoned and frustrated by high Byzantine taxes, threw open their doors; and when the Romans tried to retaliate, it only ended in disaster. In one famous attempt, the Byzantine forces had actually got someone to betray one of the Ostrogothic strongholds at Verona; and while a force of a hundred men snuck inside and threw open the gates the eleven commanders of the Byzantine Army assembled outside Bickered about how to split the loot from the town and so caught up were they in this argument [that] no one ever Actually ordered their army to go through the now open gates Before the commanders were done in fighting the Ostrogoths had received the gate and the Roman Force trapped inside had to leap over the city wall in an attempt [to] escape shortly after that a roman force of 12,000 was scattered by five thousand men under [totila] And italy became theirs for the taking save for a few major cities and a few well fortified coastal towns all of italy all of Belisarius is hard-won conquests fell to the Gothic forces even Naples with its strong Walls couldn't stand against the Ostrogothic King twice the Romans tried to resupply it from sicily but twice they failed once by having their fleets scattered by the fleet of [totila] and Once by Nature herself when the wind turned against them and when naples isolated and starving at last handed over the keys [to] the city Justinian knew it was time He needed to get belisarius back in the fight But the Empire was already strained to its limits Justinian made Belisarius underwrite the cost of the war sending him off essentially without an army to collect conscripts along the way but through all of thrace and delirium Belisarius could only raise four thousand men and when he got to italy he found the situation to be even worse there were very few Roman soldiers there And they'd already gone for years without pay morale was at Rock-bottom and every day more of them deserted to go join the ostrogoths Belisarius had to start all over again from the very Belisaruis secured a few towns and established a presence in a few ports But soon he found himself out of resources he had neither the men nor the arms nor the supplies He needed and at the same time many of those that he'd recruited along the road to italy got word of the fact that Barbarian Tribes had invaded their homeland and deserted to defend their own families and farms and while belisarius had a few successes and would on occasion [even] best to Teyla in the field he could never capitalize on those successes enough to move the war forward plagued by insubordination and low morale He couldn't even defend rome the city he had spent so much of his life trying to bring back into the empire the goal [that] Had personally cost him so much the byzantine empire Just couldn't support the war in Italy any longer the ravages of the barbarians the assaults of cause Ro the utter devastation Of the plague all of these had sacked the empire of its vitality of its strength its reserves had all been spent on monumental buildings and Grand campaigns And when these waves of tragedy had hit there was simply nothing left to fall back on and so though belisarius was able to briefly Reoccupy [rome] he soon recalled to defend Constantinople never to reunite Italy and never to campaign again and Rome that city that was to be his and Justinian's legacy fell again to the ostrogoths not long after he departed Meanwhile Rebellion had flared up in Africa And the same old story of lack of pay disunity of command and Plague spreading through the Army Kept the rebellion alive for years fortunately this rebellion was eventually successfully quelled the same year belisarius withdrew from Italy A much-needed victory Amidst so many losses [it] had cost more time and money than it ever should have but at least it would not go the way of italy then in 548 Theodora died of cancer Justinian wept at her casket the indomitable emperor in tears for all to see he would not marry again Even though he lacked an heir He chose to name his nephew [in-law] as his successor rather than betray her memory But even as she had neared her death the entire time he never forgot his empire after so many failures and setbacks many others would have just sunk into dejection and let the empire rot but never Justinian say what you will about him, but Justinian never once abandoned what he thought to be his duty He worked to slowly put the pieces back together with the same tireless spirit He had applied in the glorious days after the Nika Revolts, but perhaps without the same joy He continued the war in Lusaka but prevented the conflict from turning into an all-out war between the byzantines and the persians he tried to reorganize the defenses to put up some resistance to the ever mounting Barbarian raids from the North he began to get the byzantine economy moving again and though it was often complained about he reestablished a system of taxation to slowly fill the [imperial] [Treasury] and to pay for all the armies he needed to protect an empire assailed on all sides and Though the weight of the world could be seen on him after Theodora's death though he had perhaps lost some of the fire he once possessed and no longer found as much joy in his old passions he did undertake one last great project a Project that had been most dear to theodora it would perhaps be the greatest he ever embarked on and it would perhaps be his greatest failure One last time Justinian attempted to [heel] the split in the church that had plagued his empire [a] split that would do more damage to the empire than Barbarian Raids or persian Kings one which would last for centuries if we talk more about byzantium [in] future series this split is going to keep coming up now when most of us think about splits and Christianity we usually think about the split between Protestant and catholic But this divide was just as bitter and ran just as deep This was the divide between the monophysites and the orthodox it was a problem that Justinian had studied for years Theodora had been monophysite he himself was orthodox Their reign was supposed to be a symbol of unity and yet the divide had persisted he had many times tried to find solutions But nothing had ever stuck But he had one final grand idea the church was split concerning a complex Theological question over the singular or dual nature of christ But in practicality it really came down to whether one accepted or refused the decisions of the council of Chalcedon? Where the dual nature of christ had become orthodoxy justinian's thought that he'd found a clever solution in the fact [that] the three Strongest voices supporting that dual Nature view also came from the now considered heretical and historian Branch of Christianity So if he could just get everybody to condemn those guys they could serve as scapegoats for the problem Monophysites could accept Chalcedon and everybody could move on he had made this proclamation in the year 543 while theodora was still alive But he would fight to get the leaders of the church to sign on for the rest of his life He worked to see that the pope who was staying with him during a period where he was exiled from rome because it was in Ostrogothic Hands endorsed his view the pope eventually gave [in] and agreed Though with great reluctance because he knew exactly what it would [mean] to his followers in italy he knew what would eventually prove true this would not heal the schism in the [east] rather it would simply end up creating a schism in the west and So italy has fallen Theodora is gone and the great Project that their union was supposed to symbolize the healing of the faith of the [empire] lies in tatters But slowly justinian is rebuilding he's not done yet. [so] [join] [us] next time as we conclude the reign of Justinian oh "
310,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,I8992A5oAWM,"More than a century after first emerging into the fog-bound, gas-lit streets of Victorian London, Sherlock Holmes is universally recognizable. Even his wardrobe and accessories are iconic: the Inverness cape, deerstalker hat, and calabash pipe, and figures such as his best friend and housemate Doctor Watson, arch-nemesis Moriarty, and housekeeper Mrs. Hudson have become part of the popular consciousness, as have his extraordinary, infallible powers of deduction utilized in the name of the law, his notorious drug use, and his popular catchphrase, ""Elementary, my dear Watson."" And yet many of these most recognizable features of Holmes don't appear in Arthur Conan Doyle's original stories. Doyle's great detective solves crimes in all sorts of ways, not just using deduction. He speculates, and at times even guesses, and regularly makes false assumptions. Furthermore, Mrs. Hudson is barely mentioned, no one says, ""Elementary, my dear Watson,"" and the detective and his sidekick live apart for much of the time. Moriarty, the grand villain,  only appears in two stories, the detective's drug use is infrequent after the first two novels, and Holmes is rarely enthralled to the English legal system; He much prefers enacting his own form of natural justice to sticking to the letter of the law. Finally, many of the most iconic elements of the Holmesian legend aren't Doyle's either. The deerstalker cap and cape were first imagined by Sidney Paget, the story's initial illustrator. the curved pipe was chosen by American actor William Gillette so that audiences could more clearly see his face on stage, and the phrase, ""Elementary, my dear Watson,"" was coined by author and humorist P.G. Wodehouse. So who exactly is Sherlock Holmes? Who's the real great detective, and where do we find him? Purists might answer  that the original Sherlock inspired by Arthur Conan Doyle's  university mentor Dr. Joseph Bell is the real one. But the fact remains that that version of Sherlock has been largely eclipsed by the sheer volume of interpretation, leaving Doyle's detective  largely unrecognizable. So there's another, more complex, but perhaps more satisfying answer to the question, but to get there, we must first consider the vast body of interpretations of the great detective. Since Conan Doyle's first story in 1887, there have been thousands of adaptations of Holmes, making him perhaps the most adapted fictional character in the world. That process began with Victorian stage adaptations, and accelerated  with the emergence of film. There were more than 100 film adaptations of Holmes in the first two decades of the 20th century alone. And since then, there have many thousands more in print, and on film, television, stage, and radio. Holmes has been reinterpreted by people everywhere, in remarkably different, and often contradictory ways. These adaptations demonstrate both Holmes's popularity and his malleability. For instance, he featured in a number of allied anti-Nazi propaganda films during World War II. And both Winston Churchill and Franklin Delano Roosevelt were avid enthusiasts, the latter even joining  the Baker Street Irregulars, a Holmesian appreciation society, and nicknaming one secret service hideout Baker Street. And yet, at the very same time, Holmes also appeared in various German-language film adaptations, some of which were said to have been much-loved favorites of Adolf Hitler. So let's return to our question. Would the real Sherlock Holmes please stand up? The truth is that this world of adaptation has made him into a palimpsest. Sherlock is a cultural text, repeatedly altered over time as each new interpretation becomes superimposed over those that proceed it. This means that Sherlock  continually evolves, embodying ideas and values often far removed from those found in Conan Doyle. And after each particular story ends, Sherlock rises again, a little changed, perhaps, with a new face and fresh mannerisms or turns of phrase, but still essentially Sherlock, our Sherlock. "
311,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,IaQdv_dBDqM,"In 1987, tens of thousands of people gathered in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage. But what started out as a celebration led to a health crisis: just a few days after the pilgrimage, more than 2,000 cases  of meningitis broke out spreading across Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world. The outbreak was so fierce that it was believed to have sparked a wave of deadly meningitis epidemics that ultimately infected tens of thousands of people worldwide. Meningitis is the inflammation  of the meninges, three tissue layers responsible for  protecting the brain and spinal cord. What makes meningitis so dangerous compared to other diseases is the sheer speed with which it invades a person’s body. In the worst cases, it causes death  within a day. Fortunately, that’s rare for patients who receive early medical treatment. The disease primarily  comes in three forms: fungal, viral, and bacterial-- the last being the most deadly by far, and what we’ll focus on. People usually contract bacterial  meningitis by breathing in tiny particles of mucus and  saliva that spray into the air when an infected person  sneezes or coughs. It can also be transmitted through kissing, or sharing cigarettes,  toothbrushes or utensils. Some people can be infected  and carry the disease without showing symptoms or getting sick, which helps the disease spread quickly to others. Once the bacteria enter  the nose, mouth, and throat, they cross the surrounding  membranes and enter the bloodstream. From there, bacteria have  rapid access to the body’s tissues --including a membrane called the blood-brain barrier. This is made of a tight mesh of cells which separate blood vessels from the brain, and block everything except for a specific set of particles, including water molecules and some gases. But in ways that scientists are  still trying to understand, meningitis bacteria can trick the barrier into letting them through. Inside the brain, the bacteria swiftly infect the meninges. This triggers inflammation as the body’s  immune response kicks into overdrive, bringing on fever and intense headaches. As swelling in the meninges worsens, the neck begins to stiffen. Swelling in the brain disrupts its normal function-- causing symptoms like hearing loss  and extreme light sensitivity. As pressure increases in the cranium,  it may also make the person confused-- one of the hallmarks of the disease. A few hours in, the rapidly multiplying bacteria start to release toxins, leading to septicemia, also known as blood poisoning. This breaks down blood vessels, letting blood seep out and form what starts out looking like a rash, and evolves into big discoloured blots  beneath the skin. At the same time, these toxins burn through oxygen in the blood, reducing the amount that gets to  major organs like the lungs and kidneys. That increases the chance  of organ shut down --and alongside spreading septicemia, threatens death. That all sounds scary, but doctors are so good at treating meningitis that a visit to the hospital can drastically reduce an adult’s risk of dying from it. The longer it’s left untreated, though, the more likely it will lead to lasting damage. If declining oxygen levels cause cell death in extreme parts of the body --like fingers, toes, arms and legs-- the risk of amputation goes up. And if bacterial toxins accumulate in the brain and trigger cell death, meningitis could also cause long-term brain damage and memory loss. So fast treatment, or better yet,  prevention, is critical. That's why most countries have vaccines that defend against the disease in its deadliest forms. Those are usually given to the people who are most at risk--like young children, people with weak immune systems, or people who gather in large groups where an outbreak of meningitis could potentially happen. In addition to those gatherings, meningitis is most common in a region called the meningitis belt that stretches across Africa, though cases do happen all over the world. If you’re concerned that you or someone  you know may have meningitis, get to the doctor as soon as possible; quick action could save your life. "
312,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,IxndOd3kmSs,"Without water, a human can only survive for about 100 hours. But there's a creature so resilient that it can go without it for decades. This one millimeter animal can survive both the hottest and coldest environments on Earth, and can even withstand high levels of radiation. This is the tardigrade, and it's one of the toughest creatures on Earth, even if it does look more like a chubby, eight-legged gummy bear. Most organisms need water to survive. Water allows metabolism to occur, which is the process that drives all the biochemical reactions that take place in cells. But creatures like the tardigrade, also known as the water bear, get around this restriction with a process called anhydrobiosis, from the Greek meaning life without water. And however extraordinary, tardigrades aren't alone. Bacteria, single-celled organisms called archaea, plants, and even other animals can all survive drying up. For many tardigrades, this requires that they go through  something called a tun state. They curl up into a ball, pulling their head and eight legs inside their body and wait until water returns. It's thought that as water becomes scarce and tardigrades enter their tun state, they start synthesize special molecules, which fill the tardigrade's cells to replace lost water by forming a matrix. Components of the cells that are sensitive to dryness, like DNA, proteins, and membranes, get trapped in this matrix. It's thought that this keeps these molecules locked in position to stop them from unfolding, breaking apart, or fusing together. Once the organism is rehydrated, the matrix dissolves, leaving behind undamaged,  functional cells. Beyond dryness, tardigrades can also tolerate other extreme stresses: being frozen, heated up past the boiling point of water, high levels of radiation, and even the vacuum of outer space. This has led to some erroneous speculation that tardigrades are extraterrestrial beings. While that's fun to think about, scientific evidence places their origin firmly on Earth where they've evolved over time. In fact, this earthly evolution  has given rise to over 1100 known species of tardigrades and there are probably many others yet to be discovered. And because tardigrades are so hardy, they exist just about everywhere. They live on every continent, including Antarctica. And they're in diverse biomes including deserts, ice sheets, the sea, fresh water, rainforests, and the highest mountain peaks. But you can find tardigrades in the most ordinary places, too, like moss or lichen found in yards, parks, and forests. All you need to find them is a little patience and a microscope. Scientists are now to trying to find out whether tardigrades use the tun state, their anti-drying technique, to survive other stresses. If we can understand how they, and other creatures, stabilize their sensitive biological molecules, perhaps we could apply this knowledge to help us stabilize vaccines, or to develop stress-tolerant crops that can cope with Earth's changing climate. And by studying how tardigrades survive prolonged exposure  to the vacuum of outer space, scientists can generate clues about the environmental limits of life and how to safeguard astronauts. In the process, tardigrades could even help us answer a critical question: could life survive on planets much less hospitable than our own? "
313,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,JMdO5KyjwAw,"Is teleportation possible? Could a baseball transform into something like a radio wave, travel through buildings, bounce around corners, and change back into a baseball? Oddly enough, thanks to quantum mechanics, the answer might actually be yes. Sort of. Here's the trick. The baseball itself couldn't  be sent by radio, but all the information about it could. In quantum physics, atoms and electrons are interpreted as a collection of distinct properties, for example, position, momentum, and intrinsic spin. The values of these properties configure the particle, giving it a quantum state identity. If two electrons have  the same quantum state, they're identical. In a literal sense, our baseball is defined by a collective quantum state resulting from its many atoms. If this quantum state information could be read in Boston and sent around the world, atoms for the same chemical elements could have this information imprinted on them in Bangalore and be carefully directed to assemble, becoming the exact same baseball. There's a wrinkle though. Quantum states aren't so easy to measure. The uncertainty principle in quantum physics implies the position and momentum of a particle can't be measured at the same time. The simplest way to measure the exact position of an electron requires scattering a particle of light, a photon, from it, and collecting the light in a microscope. But that scattering changes the momentum of the electron in an unpredictable way. We lose all previous information about momentum. In a sense,  quantum information is fragile. Measuring the information changes it. So how can we transmit something we're not permitted to fully read without destroying it? The answer can be found in the strange phenomena of quantum entanglement. Entanglement is an old mystery from the early days of quantum physics and it's still not entirely understood. Entangling the spin of two electrons results in an influence that transcends distance. Measuring the spin of the first electron determines what spin will measure for the second, whether the two particles are a mile or a light year apart. Somehow, information about the first electron's quantum state, called a qubit of data, influences its partner without  transmission across the intervening space. Einstein and his colleagues called this strange communcation spooky action at a distance. While it does seem that entanglement between two particles helps transfer a qubit instantaneously across the space between them, there's a catch. This interaction must begin locally. The two electrons must be entangled in close proximity before one of them is transported to a new site. By itself, quantum entanglement isn't teleportation. To complete the teleport, we need a digital message to help interpret the qubit at the receiving end. Two bits of data created by measuring the first particle. These digital bits must be transmitted by a classical channel that's limited by the speed of light, radio, microwaves, or perhaps fiberoptics. When we measure a particle for this digital message, we destroy its quantum information, which means the baseball must disappear from Boston for it to teleport to Bangalore. Thanks to the uncertainty principle, teleportation transfers the information about the baseball between the two cities and never duplicates it. So in principle, we could teleport  objects, even people, but at present, it seems unlikely we can measure the quantum states of the trillion trillion or more atoms in large objects and then recreate them elsewhere. The complexity of this task and the energy needed is astronomical. For now, we can reliably teleport single electrons and atoms, which may lead to super-secured data encryption for future quantum computers. The philosophical implications of quantum teleportation are subtle. A teleported object doesn't exactly transport across space like tangible matter, nor does it exactly transmit across space, like intangible information. It seems to do a little of both. Quantum physics gives us  a strange new vision for all the matter in our universe as collections of fragile information. And quantum teleportation reveals new ways to influence this fragility. And remember, never say never. In a little over a century, mankind has advanced from an uncertain  new understanding of the behavior of electrons at the atomic scale to reliably teleporting them across a room. What new technical mastery  of such phenomena might we have in 1,000,  or even 10,000 years? Only time and space will tell. "

In 2017, this untitled artwork was auctioned  off for over 110 million dollars. But it’s not the work of some old master. These strokes of genius belong to 21 year old  black Brooklynite Jean-Michel Basquiat – one of America’s most  charismatic painters, and currently, its highest sold. Born in 1960 to a Haitian father  and a Puerto Rican mother, Basquiat spent his childhood making art  and mischief in Boerum Hill. While he never attended art school, he learned by wandering through New York galleries, and listening to the music his father played at home. He drew inspiration from  unexpected places, scribbling his own versions of cartoons,  comic books and biblical scenes on scrap paper from his father’s office. But it was a medical encyclopedia that arguably exerted the most powerful influence on Basquiat. When young Jean-Michael was hit by a car, his mother brought a copy of ""Grey’s Anatomy"" to his hospital bed. It ignited a lifelong fascination with anatomy that manifested in the skulls,  sinew and guts of his later work – which frequently explores both the power and vulnerability of marginalized bodies. By 17, he launched his first foray into  the art world with his friend Al Diaz. They spray painted cryptic statements  and symbols all over Lower Manhattan, signed with the mysterious moniker SAMO. These humorous, profound, and rebellious declarations were strategically scattered throughout Soho’s art scene. And after revealing himself as the artist, Basquiat leveraged SAMO’s success  to enter the scene himself; selling postcards, playing clubs with his avant-garde band, and boldly seeking out his heroes. By 21, he’d turned to painting full time. His process was a sort of  calculated improvisation. Like Beat writers who composed their work by shredding  and reassembling scraps of writing, Basquiat used similar cut-up techniques  to remix his materials. When he couldn't afford canvases, he fashioned them out of discarded wood he found on the street. He used oil stick, crayons,  spray paint and pencil and pulled quotes from the menus,  comic books and textbooks he kept open on the studio floor. He kept these sources open on his studio floor, often working on multiple  projects at once. Pulling in splintered anatomy,  reimagined historical scenes, and skulls transplanted from  classical still-lives, Basquiat repurposed both present day  experiences and art history into an inventive visual language. He worked as if inserting himself into the legacy of artists he borrowed from, producing collages that were just as much in conversation with art history as they were with each other. For instance, ""Toussaint L’Overture versus Savonarola"" and ""Undiscovered Genius of the  Mississippi Delta"" offer two distinct visions of Basquiat’s  historical and contemporary concerns. But they echo each other in the details, such as the reappearing head that also resurfaces in ""PPCD."" All these pieces form a network that offers physical evidence of Basquiat’s restless and prolific mind. These chaotic canvases won  rapid acclaim and attention. But despite his increasingly  mainstream audience, Basquiat insisted on depicting  challenging themes of identity and oppression. Marginalized figures take center stage,  such as prisoners, cooks and janitors. His obsession with bodies, history,  and representation can be found in works evoking the  Atlantic slave trade and African history, as well as pieces focusing on  contemporary race relations. In less than a decade, Basquiat made thousands of  paintings and drawings- along with sculpture, fragments  of poetry and music. His output accelerated alongside  his meteoric rise to fame, but his life and work were  cut tragically short when he died from a drug overdose  at the age of 27. After his death, Basquiat’s work only increased in value- but the energy and flair of his pieces have impacted much more than their  financial worth. Today, his influence swirls around us in  music, poetry, fashion and film- and his art retains the power to  shock, inspire, and get under our skin. "
315,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Jsj-hDW9bS8,"On May 27th, 1941, the German battleship Bismarck sank in a fierce firefight, leaving only 118 of her  2,200 crew members alive. But when a British destroyer came to collect the prisoners, they found an unexpected survivor - a black and white cat clinging to a floating plank. For the next several months this cat hunted rats and raised British morale - until a sudden torpedo strike shattered the hull and sank the ship. But, miraculously, not the cat. Nicknamed Unsinkable Sam, he rode to Gibraltar with the rescued crew and served as a ship cat on three more vessels – one of which also sank - before retiring to the Belfast Home for Sailors. Many may not think of cats as serviceable sailors, or cooperative companions of any kind. But cats have been working alongside humans for thousands of years -  helping us just as often as we help them. So how did these solitary creatures go  from wild predator to naval officer to sofa sidekick? The domestication of the modern house cat can be traced back to more than 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, at the start of the Neolithic era. People were learning to bend nature to their will, producing much more food than farmers could eat at one time. These Neolithic farmers stored their excess grain in large pits and short, clay silos. But these stores of food attracted hordes of rodents, as well as their predator, Felis silvestris lybica - the wildcat found across North Africa and Southwest Asia. These wildcats were fast, fierce, carnivorous hunters. And they were remarkably similar in size and appearance to today’s domestic cats. The main differences being that ancient wildcats were more muscular, had striped coats, and were less social towards other cats and humans. The abundance of prey in rodent-infested granaries drew in these typically solitary animals. And as the wildcats learned to tolerate the  presence of humans and other cats during mealtime, we think that farmers likewise tolerated the cats in exchange for free pest control. The relationship was so beneficial that the cats migrated with Neolithic farmers from Anatolia into Europe and the Mediterranean. Vermin were a major scourge of the seven seas. They ate provisions and gnawed at lines of rope, so cats had long since become essential sailing companions. Around the same time these Anatolian globe trotting cats set sail, the Egyptians domesticated  their own local cats. Revered for their ability to dispatch venomous snakes, catch birds, and kill rats, domestic cats became important to Egyptian religious culture. They gained immortality in frescos, hieroglyphs, statues, and even tombs, mummified alongside their owners. Egyptian ship cats cruised the Nile, holding poisonous river snakes at bay. And after graduating to larger vessels, they too began to migrate from port to port. During the time of the Roman Empire, ships traveling between India and Egypt carried the lineage of the central Asian wildcat F. s. ornata. Centuries later, in the Middle Ages, Egyptian cats voyaged up to the Baltic Sea on the ships of Viking seafarers. And both the Near Eastern  and North African wildcats – probably tamed at this point --  continued to travel across Europe, eventually setting sail for Australia and the Americas. Today, most house cats have descended from either the Near Eastern or the Egyptian lineage of F.s.lybica. But close analysis of the genomes and coat patterns of modern cats tells us that unlike dogs, which have undergone centuries of selective breeding, modern cats are genetically very similar to ancient cats. And apart from making them more social and docile, we’ve done little to alter their natural behaviors. In other words, cats today are more or less as they’ve always been: Wild animals. Fierce hunters. Creatures that don’t see us as their keepers. And given our long history together, they might not be wrong. "
316,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,JuuYBVsg_Hg,"Jhesus-Maria, Duke of Burgundy, Joan the Maid requests of you, in the name of the King of Heaven, that the King of France and yourself should make a good, firm, lasting peace. I beg and request of you, with clasped hands, to not fight any battles, nor wage war against us – neither yourself, your troops, nor subjects; and know beyond a doubt that despite whatever number of soldiers you bring against us, they will never win. And there will be tremendous heartbreak from the great clash and from the blood that will spill from those who come against us. July 17th, 1429 Reims Cathedral Four months before, Joan had met with the Dauphin Charles in private. There, she had promised him that she would relieve the siege of Orleans and bring him to Reims, where all French monarchs were crowned. And while this message from the King of Heaven was welcomed, it also seemed... incredible. Then, the season of miracles began. After her victory at Orleans, Joan had pressed Charles to take the castles and bridges along the Loire. They'd fallen one by one, with Joan personally leading the troops to the walls. When the English had set up an ambush between two woods, it could've been another Agincourt. But a stag, spooked by the army, had disordered the English ranks. With Joan at the head, Armagnac forces smashed into the English, finally avenging that long-ago defeat. Now, the English were evacuating the Loire Valley. She insisted Charles pushed for Reims. It was a stretch. The city lay deep in English territory. But she had done it. City after city surrendered to her without a fight, opening their gates after she drafted letters that promised clemency from their God-appointed king, and destruction if they defied him. Only one resisted; Troyes, the same city where the Dauphin's parents had signed a treaty disinheriting him. Yet, there, too, Joan prevailed. The city's spiritual leader, an apocalypse preaching friar, known for conducting ceremonies where citizens burned board games and beauty products in a bonfire of the vanities, had been so impressed with Joan that he switched sides. The city capitulated after four days of Joan parading her banner outside the walls. And the friar now served in her retinue. Joan had brought Charles to Reims without a single death in battle. And now, the Dauphin – no, no, no, not the Dauphin anymore! The new king stood among the grand men of his kingdom, anointed with the oil of clovis, wearing a crown. Joan stood by the king's side with her banner, watching her divine work fulfilled. And her family had been invited and looked on at their daughter: a shepherdess, who now wore armor, drank fine wine, and had a staff of servants. It was a perfect moment – the last perfect moment. Because with her divine task complete, Joan entered a strange time. She'd done what she'd set out to do, so... now what? Up to this point, all of her actions had a focus, an ordained mission she knew was righteous, a shining light that illuminated the path. Her voices still spoke, though, still said it was her mission to drive the English from France. But before, they had had a plan: relieve Orleans, crown Charles. Now they were getting a little lighter on the specifics. And also, things, politically, were getting a great deal murkier. Previously, she'd fought the English exclusively. But now she was on the cusp of a campaign where she'd battle fellow Frenchmen: Burgundians, the false French as the Armagnacs liked to call them, but it still felt different. Joan was also embroiled in the profane world of politics. Once Charles got a crown, the first thing he did was to enter truce negotiations with the Burgundians. It was sensible. His treasury couldn't sustain a continued conflict and there was new territory to consolidate. But negotiations meant give and take; offering to recognize the Duke of Burgundy's powers over the lands given to him by the English, for example. Or, saying Burgundy didn't have to treat Charles as King. This frustrated Joan. She wanted a truce, sure, and had even sent her own letter to the Duke of Burgundy. But she wanted a truce that acknowledged Charles as King. After all, was not God on their side? And if so, why make a deal with these false French, who had no submitted to the will of the King of Heaven? To Joan, this was as much a pilgrimage as it was a war. If the armies of France marched with faith in their ultimate victory, God would grant them that victory. He had before, and indeed, Joan's supreme faith and inspirational from-the-front leadership style had broken a deadlock that simple military strategy had found intractable. But the larger fact was that logistics, army pay, and other details had also come into the equation. And the King's advisors were increasingly shutting her out of the inner circle. So, therefore, it was almost a relief when the Burgundians broke their truce by reinforcing Paris. And the King was persuaded to attack the city. Joan had advocated this course before, and once again, she was in the front line, helping place cannons, and arguing for her favorite tactic of... GET EM!!! Charles was... let's say, less enthusiastic. Paris was a risky venture, but he had agreed to an all-out assault with Joan attacking the city's main gate house. On the Feast of the Nativity of Our Lady, she unfurled her banner and went to the front. But Paris was unlike any other place she'd ever attacked. It was the best defended city in France, and the Burgundians holding it had popular support. Joan's attacks smashed against the defenses, with Joan yelling up at the walls for the Burgundians to surrender. They replied with a squall of crossbow bolts. One slammed deep into Joan's thigh. The man carrying her banner was nailed to the earth by his foot, and when he put up his visor to wiggle the quarrel free, a followup shot ran through his face. Her pages dragged Joan to the rear, and this time, the wound was too serious for her to rejoin the battle. Charles sounded the retreat. Losses from the first day of the siege were heavy enough that he would not authorize a second. There would be no miracle this time. Joan had her first defeat. And Charles instead formed a truce with the Burgundians, leaving the capitol still in enemy hands. And that called some things into question. After all, if Joan's victory at Orleans was a miracle, why hadn't heaven similarly intervened at Paris? Everyone went in search of justification. Joan's allies suggested that perhaps she had succumbed to pride and overambition, and that God had simply humbled her. Others said God had withdrawn his support because she attacked on a feast day, usually considered too holy for war. And her enemies claimed that it was evidence she was a witch, and her victory at Orleans a work of Satan, and that the Almighty instead had heard the prayers of Paris's defenders. And the questions, they were getting harder. People were writing her to ask which pope to support, enlisting her to condemn Czech rebels, who had insisted the Catholic Church was corrupt and in need of reform. And, she could not explain the defeat in Paris. What did that mean? The truce left her cooling her heels, resting and writing letters increasingly distant from the King. Then, came the gifts. For her service, Charles ennobled Joan and her family, making them minor members of the nobility. And declared her home village exempt from taxation. This was essentially an honorable discharge, a suggestion that her moment had passed. She'd done what she'd promised, and that she should just go home. Charles had decided that his miraculous shepherdess should be put out to pasture. But Joan refused to go. She was a soldier, and she would continue to fight. And thankfully, before the pressure got too great, she was given an assignment. A city was about to come under siege by a combined English and Burgundian force. And she would help relieve it. It wasn't a glorious mission, but the besieged needed her. So, she went. May 23rd, 1430 A raid. Joan and her troops entered the Burgundian camp, ready to sack the supplies. This way, when the enemy reaches the city, the besiegers will have little to eat. Then, shouts. She sees Burgundian troops emerging from ambush, thousands of enemies ready to cut them off. It had been a trap. Her forces flee to the bridge. Men shout for her to cross, to get back into the city. But Joan the Maid does not run from battle. She will stand with her men in the rearguard, letting others escape. Even when six thousand ambushers encircled the rearguard, cutting them off from the bridge. Even when her enemies surround her. She holds her banner, urges her comrades to fight in the name of God. Until an archer hauls her from the saddle. She insists that she will only surrender to their officer. After all, she is an ennobled soldier of France. The Maid of Orleans. Her rank demands nothing less. But these Burgundians don't ransom her back to Charles like any other knight. They move her from prison to prison for nearly a year. Joan tries to escape her first prison by breaking through the floor. In response, they move her to a tower in another castle. More months pass. Joan stares out the window, heart sick over the besieged city she couldn't rescue. Every day, her voices tell her she mustn't jump. Then Joan hears she's been sold to the English. She decides she would rather die trying to flee than be a prisoner of her enemies. But it's seventy feet to the ground, and if she jumps, she could very well kill herself. And suicide is a mortal sin. Her voices tell Joan not to do it. They insist that God will rescue her. She in turn ignores them, puts one foot on the ledge, and launches herself into the night.

317,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,K-aAUwAFZlQ,"""Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and others have greatness thrust upon them"", quoth William Shakespeare. Or did he? Some people question whether Shakespeare really wrote the works that bear his name, or whether he even existed at all. They speculate that Shakespeare was a pseudonym for another writer, or a group of writers. Proposed candidates  for the real Shakespeare include other famous playwrights,  politicians and even some prominent women. Could it be true that the greatest writer in the English language was as fictional as his plays? Most Shakespeare scholars  dismiss these theories based on historical  and biographical evidence. But there is another way to test whether Shakespeare's famous lines were actually written by someone else. Linguistics, the study of language, can tell us a great deal about the way we speak and write by examining syntax, grammar,  semantics and vocabulary. And in the late 1800s, a Polish philosopher  named Wincenty Lutosławski formalized a method known as stylometry, applying this knowledge to investigate questions of literary authorship. So how does stylometry work? The idea is that each writer's style has certain characteristics that remain fairly uniform  among individual works. Examples of characteristics include average sentence length, the arrangement of words, and even the number of occurrences of a particular word. Let's look at use of the word thee and visualize it as a dimension, or axis. Each of Shakespeare's works can be placed on that axis, like a data point, based on the number of occurrences of that word. In statistics, the tightness  of these points gives us what is known as the variance, an expected range for our data. But, this is only a single characteristic in a very high-dimensional space. With a clustering tool called Principal Component Analysis, we can reduce the multidimensional space into simple principal components that collectively measure the variance in Shakespeare's works. We can then test the works of our candidates against those principal components. For example, if enough works of Francis Bacon fall within the Shakespearean variance, that would be pretty strong evidence that Francis Bacon and Shakespeare are actually the same person. What did the results show? Well, the stylometrists who carried this out have concluded that Shakespeare is none other  than Shakespeare. The Bard is the Bard. The pretender's works just don't match up with Shakespeare's signature style. However, our intrepid statisticians did find some compelling evidence  of collaborations. For instance, one recent study concluded that Shakespeare worked with playwright Christopher Marlowe on ""Henry VI,"" parts one and two. Shakespeare's identity is only one of  the many problems stylometry can resolve. It can help us determine when a work was written, whether an ancient text is a forgery, whether a student has committed plagiarism, or if that email you just received is of a high priority or spam. And does the timeless poetry of Shakespeare's lines just boil down to numbers and statistics? Not quite. Stylometric analysis may reveal what makes Shakespeare's works structurally distinct, but it cannot capture the beauty of the sentiments and emotions they express, or why they affect us the way they do. At least, not yet. "
318,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,KFVdHDMcepw,"Upon emerging from stasis, Ethic is the unfortunate recipient of three surprises. The first: a prison cell. The second: complete amnesia. And the third: a mysterious stranger has gotten stuck squeezing through the bars on her window. His name is Hedge, and he has come  to help Ethic save the world. But first they have to break out of jail. Hedge turns his hand into a lockpick and  outlines the challenge ahead. Each lock in the prison works  in the same unusual way. Inside the keyhole is a red dial that can  be rotated to one of 100 positions numbered 1 through 100. The key for a given cell spins the dial to the right position, which, when stopped there, makes it turn green and unlocks the door. It would be out of the question to steal keys from a guard, but Hedge has a better idea. Hedge can carry out Ethic‘s commands. If Ethic tells him to walk 5 steps forward, turn right, then walk another 5 steps, that’s exactly what he’ll do. Hedge needs specific instructions though. If Ethic says “pick the lock” or  “try every combination” that would be too vague, but “spin the  dial 5 positions forward” would work. Once out of the cell, they will only have  a few moments to crack the lock for the outer prison door too before  the guards catch them. So what instructions will allow Hedge  to efficiently open any door? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Before we explain the solution, here’s a hint. A key programming concept that can help unlock the door is called a loop. This can be one or more instructions that Hedge will iterate— or repeat— a specified number of times, like “jump up and down 100 times.” Or an instruction that Hedge will repeat until a condition is met, such as “keep jumping up and down until it’s 7 o’clock.” Pause now to figure it out for yourself. The first thing that’s clear is that you  need to find a way for Hedge to try every combination until one works. What takes a little more effort is how exactly you do so. One solution would be to instruct Hedge to try every combination in succession. Try 1 and check the light. If it turns green, open the door,  and if not, try 2. If that doesn’t work try 3.  All the way up to 100. But it would be tedious to lay  that out in its entirety. Why write more than 100 lines of code, when you can do the same thing with just 3? This is where a loop comes in. There are a few ways to go about this. The lock has 100 positions, so Ethic could say “Check the dial’s  color, then spin the dial forward once, for 100 repetitions. Remember where the dial turns green, then have Hedge set it back to that number.” A loop like this, where you specify the number of times it repeats, is called a “for"" loop. But an even more efficient loop would have Hedge spin the dial one position at a time until it turns green and as soon as that happens, have him stop and open the door. That way if the door unlocks on 1, he doesn’t need to cycle through  all the rest of the numbers. This is an “until” loop, because it involves doing an action until a condition is met. A similar, alternate approach would be to turn the dial while it’s still red, then stop. That’s called a “while” loop. Back to the adventure. Hedge loops through the combinations, and the cell opens at 41. Ethic and Hedge wait until the perfect moment in the guards’ rotation and make a break for it. Soon, Ethic faces a choice:  hide inside a mysterious crystal, or try to crack the outer door  and make a run for it. Ethic chooses to run. The second door takes Hedge longer,  requiring him to spin all the way to 93. But he gets it open and takes the opportunity to explain why he’s rescued Ethic. The world is in turmoil: robots have taken over,  and only Ethic can set things right. In order to do so, they’ll need to collect three  powerful artifacts that are being used for nefarious  purposes across the land. Only then can Ethic return to the  world machine— that giant crystal— to set things right. Ethic may have escaped the prison… but what has she gotten herself into? "
319,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,KOz-bNhEHhQ,"At some point, most sexually active people will be infected with human papillomavirus, or ‘HPV.’ There are over 100 types of HPV, and most of the time the body  eliminates infections without symptoms– but some strains can pose serious  health risks down the line. HPV causes contact infections, which means the virus stays in the cells near the point of infection rather than spreading throughout the whole body. Since HPV is often transmitted through  sexual activity, this usually means the cells of the  vagina, vulva, penis, anus, mouth and throat. We can test for HPV in cells from  these areas, but while testing for the virus  is scientifically possible, it isn’t common. The main reason is that, while there are treatments for the adverse health effects caused by HPV, there’s no treatment for the virus itself. So testing for HPV would yield many,  many positives, and although most of them won’t  be cause for concern, there is still no treatment plan for  clearing the body of the virus. But there are other good ways to  protect yourself from HPV. We’re going to walk through how  HPV can cause harm, who’s at risk, and how to minimize those risks. The body’s immune system is able to eradicate most strains of HPV before they cause any harm— and without people even knowing  they’ve been infected. Certain other strains– like HPV 6 and 11– cause abnormalities in the cells of the  infected tissue, which can develop into genital warts. While these are infectious and require treatment, usually with topical creams, wart-causing strains don’t create  longer-term damage. But another 13 strains can cause DNA mutations that cause cells to divide at a much faster pace than normal, propelling the development of cancerous growths. The cells of the cervix are  especially at risks. Two in particular– HPV 16 and 18– are responsible for the majority of cases of cervical cancer, which is now the fourth most common type of cancer in women. It can take up to 20 years for cancer symptoms to appear, but with regular screening, we can discover cellular abnormalities in the cervix before they develop into cancer. Women over 21 can undergo a regular  pap smear, where a sample of tissue is gently  scraped from the lining of the cervix to test for abnormal cells. A positive test doesn’t mean the person has cervical cancer, but rather that there are irregular  cells in the cervix that could develop into cancer in the future. Patients are then either monitored  with more frequent pap smears, or, for more severe irregularities, undergo a procedure called a colposcopy. This involves a doctor examining the  cervix through a microscope, and possibly taking a small biopsy of  tissue for closer examination. In some cases, the affected tissue  may be removed. HPV infections of the throat may lead to head and neck cancers, but for now there’s no equivalent of the  pap smear for the throat. Using condoms helps prevent  the spread of HPV during sex. And there are three safe, effective  vaccines that all target HPV 16 and 18. The vaccine comes in two or three doses  a few months apart, and it’s only beneficial if you  receive them all. Right now the vaccine is part of standard  care for girls aged 11 to 18 in many countries– though it’s increasingly becoming  available to boys as well. Adult women and men in countries including the United States and the United Kingdom can opt to receive the vaccine, and evidence suggests that vaccination of women and men could reduce the worldwide incidence of cervical cancer by almost 90%. Researchers are also  developing an injection for people who are already infected  with HPV 16 and 18, which would target the infected cells to stop them from developing into cancerous ones. So while there’s still room for  improvement in screening, treatment, and access to each, condom use, vaccination,  and cervical screening can each reduce the harm caused by HPV. "
320,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,KgdiYvcOi_w,"Berlin, August 13th, 1961 At midnight, the trucks come. East German troops and workers disembark, lining up behind the white lines that separate East and West Berlin. The soldiers have orders to fire if approached. Berlin has been divided since World War II, the communist German Democratic Republic surrounding an enclave of the western Federal Republic of Germany. But that division was political. People crossed the border to work and see family. Couples lived on either side. No more. East Germany was suffering a brain drain, doctors, lawyers and professors fleeing to the west via the easy crossing. The embarrassment became too much for the Soviets. The soldiers string barbed wire, the workers tear up the streets. Four days later, the first concrete slabs arrive. They're building a wall. This episode is sponsored by World of Tanks. Download the game on PC at the link below and use the code CHECKPOINTC to claim your $15 starter pack. 28 years later, the wall still stands. On one side, it’s filled with color, graffiti, political slogans, art. On the other, bare concrete. It’s twelve feet high, four feet wide, and 87 miles long. It encircles the city, an island linked only to West Germany by rail, road, and air corridors. But the wall is only one obstacle. Behind it sits a 110 yard “death strip” covered with gravel, the buildings that stood there cleared. Flood lights glare down on it. There is no cover. Machine gun bunkers watch over it and it’s seeded with mines, anti-vehicle moats, and dogs. By 1989, somewhere between 140 and 192 people had died trying to cross. Five thousand more made it, digging tunnels, ramming through in cars, even floating across in hot air balloons. The wall has become a fact of life. For West Berliners it was a good place to find parking. Pubs nearby featured photos of West and East Berliners clinking steins over the barbed wire. And rock musicians, from Genesis, to Springsteen, to Bowie hold concerts close to it so those over the wall can hear. The wall, people think, will not fall anytime soon. Some in the west say it shouldn’t, reunification would be too expensive, the number of East German refugees would wreck the economy. Kennedy had declared himself a Berliner, and the wall didn't fall. Reagan challenged Gorbachev to tear it down, and the wall didn't fall. As the new president George H.W. Bush comes into office, he’s decided to focus on Asia, deeming European problems too static. Nothing will change there. In reality, the wall is about to come down. The people who'd destroy it are mostly unknown in the west. Mid-range communist officials and leaders of Eastern Bloc nations, some looking to sabotage the Iron Curtain, some to maintain it. But in the end, the wall would fall by accident. June, 1989 East Germany is in trouble. In fact, communism is in trouble in general. Nearly bankrupt from a multi-decade arms race and supporting proxy conflicts, battered from its invasion of Afghanistan and its image tarnished by the Chernobyl disaster, the Soviet Union needs change. Its new leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, comes to power with two new ideas; a new economic and social policy called perestroika, introducing market elements and reforms to the socialist model, and also glasnost, a new openness of government. He’s hailed as a peacemaker in Europe, especially after negotiating with Reagan to eliminate a whole class of nuclear weapons. He talks about giving the governments of Eastern Bloc countries a freer hand. No one believes him at first. The USSR had previously intervened to crush opposition movements in countries like Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, but nations of the Eastern Bloc realize he’s genuine. It starts to snowball. Poland holds its first free elections in June 1989, kicking out the communists, and sweeping in the Solidarity Party. In Hungary, the central committee picks a Harvard-trained economic minister, Miklós Németh, to be Prime Minister. They know he’s reform-minded, but if his reforms fail he’ll make a good scapegoat. But Németh secretly believes that a reformed communist state will be on economic life support. He wants Hungary to join the west before the rest of the Eastern Bloc, so it gets a few years of special treatment and development aid. To make that a reality. he has to bring down the Iron Curtain, be seen doing it. The easiest way to do that is trigger a flood of East German refugees. He announces, on television, that it’s become too expensive to maintain Hungary’s border with Austria. International news watches as Hungarian officials switch off the electric fence. In a meeting with Gorbachev, Németh has telegraphed this move, asking if the USSR would intervene. Gorbachev says no. But the flood of East German escapees didn’t arrive. So Németh pushed it further. He announces a picnic. A Pan-European Picnic, where Hungary would open a gate and allow visitors from Austria to cross and join the fun. A sign of thawing tensions. A ruse for a great escape. Németh holds it during tourist season, when thousands of East Germans are vacationing in Hungary. He even busses some in for the event and gives them maps, so they knew where the border is. For safety, you know! Because the border is right there. And the gates are very open. And the guards are so busy checking Austrian passports you might accidentally wander into Austria. No one wants that, right? Because Austria is so close to West Germany. Chaos. 600 East Germans take off at a run, through the open gate. West German officials and Red Cross volunteers wait on the other side. Hungary, claiming to be “overwhelmed” by East German refugees lets thousands cross the border each day. After the East Germans bar the border with Hungary, the “great escape” spreads to Czechoslovakia. The West German embassy in Prague gives out asylum visas, allowing East Germans to cross the Czech-Austrian border and head to the west. By November 9th, 250 000 have fled East Germany. 30-mile traffic jams snarl the autobahn. Mass protests calling for democracy, economic reform, and the right to free travel, explode in Leipzig and East Berlin. But the East German leader Erich Honecker, who built the wall and who controls the Stasi, one of the most feared secret police, refuses to make reforms. When Gorbachev visits Honecker in Berlin, a crowd gathers, chanting: “Gorby, save us! Gorby, save us!” It's the moment Honecker’s subordinates have waited for. They vote him out in a coup, planning to save East Germany with reforms to keep it running and them in power. The first thing on the agenda? A new travel law. November 9th, 1989 A Press Conference in East Berlin Günter Schabowski, a communist party boss, reads the press briefing on live TV. He doesn’t realize that this speech, unrehearsed and unscripted, will do what no speech before has ever accomplished. It will bring down the wall. He reads off new dull regulations, saving the new travel law for last. East Germans will be able to apply at checkpoints to go to West Berlin. They will need a visa in their passport, or a special stamp on their ID card. Next item. “Wait,” said a journalist. “Effective when?” Around Berlin, everyone stopped, staring at the TV. The press release was supposed to be dated the next day, November 10th. The idea was that people would line up to get their visas. If Schabowski had known that, and said so, maybe that would’ve happened. Instead, he just shuffled the paper, found the wording, shrugged and said: “As far as I know, immediately. Without delay.” East Berliners stood, stunned. Then they went. Dropped everything and left. Closed shops, left telephone switchboards, snatched up passports and thronged the checkpoints. The first woman at Checkpoint Charlie, crossing to the former American sector, wore a coat thrown over her bathrobe. She had curlers in her hair. They insisted the guards let them cross. Schabowski had said they could on TV. Immediately. Without delay. Panicked border guards went into their booths and tried to dial officials for confirmation. There were thousands of people outside. But Schabowski had gone home, unaware of the firestorm he’d created. Most of the party leaders were at the opera. So after a few hours the border guards shrugged. ""Okay, open up."" The first people through the wall didn’t walk, the surging crowd carried them. And they were met by West Germans holding flowers and champagne. A spontaneous party started. Boom boxes and pop music. East and West Germans kissed, climbed the wall, chanted to tear it down. They were climbing both sides now, the colorful and the blank. Hammers and chisels came out. People took turns pecking at the wall. It was wild. It went on for days. Woodstock with sledgehammers. The Cold War ended not with nuclear annihilation, but a street party. The celebration did more to undermine the German Democratic Republic than anything else. The images of partying refugees were hard to dismiss, and weakened East Germany so that reunification became inevitable. Not with a melding of states, but with East Germany absorbed into the Federal Republic. And the party continued. in a month, Czechoslovakia’s last communist leader fell to the Velvet Revolution. Bulgaria had ousted its hardline leaders and called elections. The next year, it was Russia itself. Not everywhere was it easy or peaceful. Street fighting rocked Romania, and the breakup of Yugoslavia would roil the Balkans for over a decade. But considering that Europe had lived 44 years, divided and fearing world war, it seemed almost unreal how quickly the barriers melted away. Though the wall’s destruction meant great things for geopolitics, it meant even more to everyday people. Families reunited. East German children tasted oranges and bananas for the first time. Europeans once again could travel and learn from each other without artificial divisions. They had torn down the wall and could now build a future.

321,Education,27,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,LVQomlXMeek,"For a long time, if you went to the library in Wilmington, North Carolina, there was one thing you weren’t allowed to research. “We were refused. We were rejected by the librarian.” “When I asked about or inquired about 1898 they wanted to know why.” “I was told that yes they had something but they kept it under lock and key."" The story of Wilmington in 1898 still isn't widely known. “What happened here — on what’s now just this empty patch of grass would radically change racial politics in North Carolina. This is the story of an American election, but also of something we don't usually find in American history. The violent overthrow of a democratically elected government. In the late 1800s, Wilmington, North Carolina was the state’s largest city. It had a majority black population, and historians today describe it as a rarity in the post-Civil War American South. “Wilmington prior to November, 1898, was what the New South could be at the cusp of the 20th century.” “There was an unusual degree of black prosperity.” In Wilmington there were successful black entrepreneurs, doctors, teachers -- but also black elected officials. And for a time, that was true throughout the State. Take a look at the politicians on this poster of the 1889 North Carolina House of Representatives. Here at the bottom — are black Republican representatives — some from Wilmington. North Carolina also sent four black Republicans to the US Congress between 1875 and 1899. The Democratic and Republican parties of 1898 in many ways occupied opposite parts of the political spectrum than they do today. “Most African-Americans were voting for the Republican Party. And the Democratic Party was white voters almost exclusively. White supremacy was the central focus of the platform for the Democratic Party.” Republicans in North Carolina were successful in part because of a 3rd party called the ""Populist"" party, made up of mostly white farmers fed up with the tough economic times. North Carolina Populists joined up with Republicans to form what they called the Fusion Party. And in the elections of 1894 and 1896, the Fusion party defeated the Democrats in sweeping victories statewide. That meant North Carolina now had a government that shared power between black and white politicians, including a newly elected Republican governor. Together, they moved towards reforms that would favor black Americans and working-class whites. “This was something that the Democratic Party folks were simply not going to accept.” A multiracial government wasn’t just a disappointment for Democrats. It was more like a humiliation. They needed a plan to take back control of the state in the next election. So party leaders, like Furnifold Simmons, future US Senator; Charles Aycock, future North Carolina Governor; and this man, Alfred Moore Wadell, came up with one: To beat the Fusion Party by luring white Populist voters away from their alliance with Black voters. Wilmington, with a large black population and a local Fusion government in power — would be a focus of their campaign. The state Democratic state party handbook for 1898 laid out their goal: consolidate the white vote by stoking white anger and resentment. It said: “this is a white man’s country and white men must control and govern it.” Their most effective tool was the media. One of North Carolina’s biggest newspapers was a Democratic Party mouthpiece. It ran racist political cartoons throughout 1898. “Not everybody was literate in 1898. But to see a political cartoon of the type that &nbsp;ran you may not be able to read it but you know exactly what it means.” Many of the cartoons were centered on the threat of “Negro domination”...even though the Fusion government was mostly white. They also played up another fear. “Black men threatening white women became a theme. White men need to do all that they can to protect white womanhood.” This was all part of North Carolina democratic strategy, but it echoed the national racist rhetoric of the time. In one speech that Democrats printed in a Wilmington paper — a prominent Georgia writer named Rebecca Felton said: “If it takes lynching a black man a day to protect white womanhood ‘I say lynch"". Her speech prompted a Wilmington black man named Alex Manly, owner of the black-run, Daily Record newspaper, to respond with a column. He made a simple observation, that at the time, was shocking. “That white women who had liaisons with black men did so voluntarily and enthusiastically.” Manly wrote “Every Negro lynched is called a ""big burly, black brute"", when in fact many were sufficiently attractive for white girls to fall in love with them.” “Manly pretty much said in a nutshell: sometimes white women choose to be with black men.” Manly’s editorial became another tool for Democrats. Newspapers reprinted it, called it “A Horrid Slander”, and ran comments about it on a daily basis. It was just a few months before the election, and white voters were angry. “By the time the election rolls around on November 8th black voters, Republican voters had been thoroughly intimidated here.” By all accounts, the elections of 1898 were a sham. The Democratic party had a paramilitary group called the Red Shirts. They attacked and blocked black residents from voting. At a rally just before the election, Alfred Moore Waddell provoked the crowds. He said “negro office-holding ought at once, and forever be brought to an end. Even if we have to choke the current of the Cape Fear River with carcasses.” The votes were counted, and the Democrats won. “Democratic candidates won every seat they had a candidate up for election in.” But some local Fusionist politicians remained in power, because their seats hadn’t been up for re-election like the white Republican mayor and the board of aldermen. And and of course the election did nothing to undo the economic power black folks held in the city. The Democrats had won the election, but their goal of total white supremacist control remained out of reach. “And so they engineered what was essentially a coup d'etat.” The day after the election, at a gathering for white men in Wilmington, the Democrats unveiled a document they called the “White Declaration of Independence.” It contained an ultimatum. Cynthia Brown, whose descendants were in Wilmington back in 1898, is a historian at her church, where there’s a preserved copy of the declaration from the next day’s newspaper. “We will no longer be ruled and will never again be ruled by men of African origin.” They would strip black men of voting rights. They would give “white men a large part of the employment heretofore given to” black men. And as for Alex Manly... “We demand that he leave this City forever within twenty-four hours.” The next morning, hundreds of white men marched to the offices of the Daily Record. Manly was gone -- he had fled to save his own life. They set the Daily Record building on fire. This is where it once stood. “Once the White leadership destroyed Alex Manly's printing press they destroyed one way in which the African-American community in Wilmington could organize itself and keep itself informed.” At City Hall — the mayor and board of aldermen were forced out. “There's two hundred armed men in City Hall at the time. They didn't do it of their own free will and as they resigned a new member selected by the Democratic Party was voted into office.” Waddell — who once threatened to fill the Cape Fear River with black bodies — was the new mayor of Wilmington. Meanwhile, the mob had grown to about 2,000 men, and the violence spilled into the streets. In these photos, exes mark where the first black residents were killed. “The stories are that they were dumped into the river. And there are varying stories about how many people were killed.” “To me, I see 40 to 60 clearly as fatalities as a result of the violence. But I think it was higher.” Many black residents hid for days in the swamps, and the wooded cemeteries in the city — including Cynthia’s great grandmother. And thousands of other residents fled Wilmington, never to return. Shortly afterward, democrats printed booklets celebrating a glorious victory...and in the newspapers, depicted black residents as the instigators. “This image is a gross misrepresentation of what actually happened. You know what you see are black men with guns not white men with machine guns.” The city never regained its black majority population. Jim Crow laws, like literacy tests and poll taxes that prevented black people from voting were immediately enacted and Wilmington’s spirit of black opportunity was crushed. Black political representation in the state was over. It would be 90 years until North Carolina elected its next black Congress member. “Wilmington did a really great job of covering up a very dark past for a very long time.” “Over the years, the textbooks on North Carolina’s state history have struggled to accurately describe what happened in 1898. This book from 1933 calls what happened “unfortunate for both races.” And this one from 1978 doesn’t have that much more detail. But they both praise Charles Aycock, one of the perpetrators of the riot, as a man with ‘a kind heart’ and that in fact he was one of ‘the best friends that the colored people had in the state.' It’s a legacy that North Carolina has yet to fully undo. The names of the perpetrators are on Wilmington's school buildings and city parks. But the legacy is also bigger than those names. Turn on the news, and the state's long history of political suppression echoes. “We turn to a strict new voter ID law in North Carolina.” “Racially gerrymandering and a push for new voting maps.” “The court says the Republican-led legislature redrew Congressional districts along racial lines, violating the Constitution.” “There is a tremendous amount of intimidation that is still felt by the black community.” “It doesn't have to be mass mayhem and violence in the streets.” “The strategy shifts towards designing state laws in such a way that you could exclude blacks from voter participation.” “The subliminal pursuit of continuing the White declaration of independence.” “And if you don't see it for what it really is, it can happen all over again.” "
322,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,LaLvVc1sS20,"During a long day spent roaming the forest in search of edible grains and herbs, the weary divine farmer Shennong accidentally poisoned himself 72 times. But before the poisons could end his life, a leaf drifted into his mouth. He chewed on it and it revived him, and that is how we discovered tea. Or so an ancient legend goes at least. Tea doesn't actually cure poisonings, but the story of Shennong, the mythical Chinese inventor  of agriculture, highlights tea's importance  to ancient China. Archaeological evidence suggests tea was first cultivated there as early as 6,000 years ago, or 1,500 years before the pharaohs built the Great Pyramids of Giza. That original Chinese tea plant is the same type that's grown  around the world today, yet it was originally consumed very differently. It was eaten as a vegetable or cooked with grain porridge. Tea only shifted from food to drink 1,500 years ago when people realized that a combination of heat and moisture could create a complex and varied taste out of the leafy green. After hundreds of years of variations to the preparation method, the standard became to heat tea, pack it into portable cakes, grind it into powder, mix with hot water, and create a beverage  called muo cha, or matcha. Matcha became so popular that a distinct Chinese tea culture emerged. Tea was the subject of books and poetry, the favorite drink of emperors, and a medium for artists. They would draw extravagant pictures in the foam of the tea, very much like the espresso art you might see in coffee shops today. In the 9th century during the Tang Dynasty, a Japanese monk brought the first tea plant to Japan. The Japanese eventually developed their own unique rituals around tea, leading to the creation  of the Japanese tea ceremony. And in the 14th century during the Ming Dynasty, the Chinese emperor  shifted the standard from tea pressed into cakes to loose leaf tea. At that point, China still held a virtual monopoly on the world's tea trees, making tea one of three essential Chinese export goods, along with porcelain and silk. This gave China a great deal of power and economic influence as tea drinking spread around the world. That spread began in earnest around the early 1600s when Dutch traders brought tea to Europe in large quantities. Many credit Queen Catherine of Braganza, a Portuguese noble woman, for making tea popular with the English aristocracy when she married King Charles II in 1661. At the time, Great Britain was in the midst of expanding its colonial influence and becoming the new dominant world power. And as Great Britain grew, interest in tea spread around the world. By 1700, tea in Europe sold for ten times the price of coffee and the plant was still  only grown in China. The tea trade was so lucrative that the world's fastest sailboat,  the clipper ship, was born out of intense competition between Western trading companies. All were racing to bring their tea back to Europe first to maximize their profits. At first, Britain paid for all this Chinese tea with silver. When that proved too expensive, they suggested trading tea  for another substance, opium. This triggered a public health problem within China as people became addicted to the drug. Then in 1839, a Chinese official ordered his men to destroy massive  British shipments of opium as a statement against  Britain's influence over China. This act triggered the First Opium War between the two nations. Fighting raged up and down  the Chinese coast until 1842 when the defeated Qing Dynasty ceded the port of Hong Kong to the British and resumed trading on unfavorable terms. The war weakened China's global standing for over a century. The British East India company also wanted to be able to grow tea themselves and further control the market. So they commissioned  botanist Robert Fortune to steal tea from China  in a covert operation. He disguised himself and took a perilous journey through China's mountainous tea regions, eventually smuggling tea trees  and experienced tea workers into Darjeeling, India. From there,  the plant spread further still, helping drive tea's rapid growth as an everyday commodity. Today, tea is the second most consumed beverage in the world after water, and from sugary Turkish Rize tea, to salty Tibetan butter tea, there are almost as many ways of preparing the beverage as there are cultures on the globe.

323,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,LsxmsHBRl1M,"1848: The People's Spring. Springtime of nations. The Year of Revolution. Music (Birth of the People) Bismarck's poltical life ended nearly as abruptly as it started. For as the summer of 1847 began, the King, unable to get a railroad grant from the Diet, without also granting a constitution, threw his hands up in the air, dissolved the Diet, and sent everyone packing. Bismarck went back home to his estate, finally completed that whole business of getting married, and went on his honeymoon. But as he traveled Europe, and when he went home, he noticed a strange tension in the air. An unrest in the streets, in the cities. Then, in February 1848, Paris erupted. The monarchy fell. A republic was re-established in France. Bismarck was concerned. At home, and abroad, he had seen the strain between the working class and those who ruled. But he never expected something so abrupt, or so successful to happen in France. Then, Vienna fell. Metternich, the great Austrian statesman and architect of the concert of Europe, was displaced. This opened up an opportunity, as the Austrians had long been the dominant force among German states. But it also served as a warning. It was clear that revolution was coming to Prussia soon. But Bismarck worried that the king was too weak and too vacillating to put down a revolution. And, he was right. As word of the revolution in Vienna spread, Prussians took to the streets, and soon, the king promised them a constitutional government. But as the people were celebrating their victory in Berlin, the celebration turned into a clash. Shots were fired, government troops killed revolutionaries. Many, including Bismarck, believed that now, there was no choice but to crush the revolution. The king, though, disagreed, and ordered the troops out of Berlin, effectively leaving himself hostage to the revolution. And then came the first of Bismarck's good(...ish) ideas. He raced back to his estate, and organized an old-school  peasant levy. Yes, in the middle of the 19th century, he tried to  press his peasants into service as their feudal lord, in order to put down a revolution, whose stated goals were to enfranchise and empower those same peasants. With this ""great"" idea in mind, he handed them all shotguns, and said, ""C'mon lads, to Berlin!"" But, just as they were storming off, one of his spoilsport neighbors came out, and told him to stop hurling a firebrand into the country, threatening to talk the peasants out of this nonsense. Bismarck politely replied, ""You know that I am a quiet man, but, if you do that, I shall shoot you."" So with revolver in hand, and four, yes four, bullets in his pocket, he led his feudal levy to go liberate the king. Unfortunately, when he got to the first army camp, which was staffed by many of the conservative officers that he had come to mingle with after making his fiery speeches in Berlin, he was promptly told, ""Yes, we are all a bit disappointed right now, but, no, we really don't want your peasant mob messing this up even more, so, how 'bout you go send your peasants back, and bring us some corn and potatoes or something."" Not content to serve as mere fodder provider for the army, Otto then had his second good(...ish) idea. He left his estate, and tried to sneak into Berlin, again, with the cleverest of ruses; trimming his beard. Needless to say, many people saw through his incredible mind games, and he was laughed out of Berlin. But Bismarck was not done. He had a THIRD good(...ish) idea. With the king making ever greater concessions to the revolutionaries, Bismarck saw it as his place to help elevate one of the king's relatives to the throne. So Bismarck went all in on trying to replace King Frederick Wilhelm, with a confusingly, but more succinctly named King Wilhelm But Wilhelm had legged it to England, and he wasn't going to listen to this wild man anyway. So Bismarck began to hunt for a new candidate. Soon, he found another royal relative named Charles, who proposed that his even more confusingly named son, Frederick Wilhelm, should replace Frederick Wilhelm on the throne. This Frederick Wilhelm, or ""Fritz"" (I'm gonna call him Fritz) was 6 years old. But nobody had asked Fritz's mom. (I mean, they EVENTUALLY did, but more as an afterthought, with Bismarck awkwardly meeting her in her servant's quarters.) Not asking turned out to be a mistake, though. Because Fritz's mom supported the Liberals, and put the kibosh on the whole thing. It would seem that Bismarck had made an enemy of the mother of this 6 year old he hoped to put on the throne. Nonetheless, he was soon summoned for the second Prussian Diet, which the king had ordered assembled to hammer out how to make a real parliament for Prussia. There, Bismarck spoke passionately about the noble past that they were so casually throwing away, even becoming choked with emotion and having to stop mid-speech. But, to no avail. The Diet did its job, and created the Prussian National Assembly, which Bismarck was very not elected to. This Prussian National Assembly pushed for a real parliamentary system along British lines, though, and soon, the king began to lose patience with the body. So Bismarck joined the Camarilla, [Which, was NOT, in fact, a secret society of vampires which has kept their presence hidden from humanity for hundreds of years.] [Though, I can understand your confusion.] [And let's be honest, Bismarck would have made a great vampire, but no.] Bismarck joined the much more boring (but real) group of nobles and courtiers close to the king, who were determined to maintain the power of the monarchy through non-vampiric means. And let's go ahead and call this Bismarck's first ACTUAL good idea, because this put him in contact with many powerful men. But even though, by all accounts, he was an effective member of this society, and even though he had amplified the conservative voice in Prussian politics, by establishing a newspaper, when the liberal cause fell apart, and the conservatives, once again, became ascendant, he was passed over for a cabinet posistion. They were very happy to use him when a radical was needed, but once the time came to re-establish order, the ""Wildman"" was cast aside. So Bismarck returned to his estate to witness the birth of his first child. But Bismarck had a plan. Bismarck ALWAYS had a plan. You see, even though the liberals HAD failed to get anything like the constitution they had wanted, they HAD gotten a constitution. And with it, a parliament, the Landtag. And Bismarck, always a pragmatist, under whatever colors he may have worn, decided to get himself elected to this new body. The fight was fierce. He knew that he wouldn't get elected in his own region, so, he decided to run for office in the city of Brandenburg, but there, he was an outsider, running against the local mayor. He acted with vigor, describing his campaign headquarters as a military camp, with messengers running in and out at all hours, and strategy being formulated so that he never missed an opportunity to speak to the few hundred men, who would, eventually, determine the representative for Brandenburg. He won by 25 votes. Now, he was once again, at the center of things. And the question at hand on everybody's mind, was the unification of Germany. If the 39 German states that had survived the Napoleonic invasion banded together, they could change the face of European politcs forever. But how to achieve that was a matter of some debate. They could either come together under Austria, or, under Prussia. But Austria rejected the possibility of unification. Because the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Habsburg inherited lands included far more more territory than just the German portions. And the whole point of unification was German nationalism. Germans would never accept rule by a sovereign who was also ruling over other nations. This meant, that the Austrians would either have to divide their empire, and give some other branch of the family their German territories, or, simply reject unification outright. (And they chose the latter.) The German National Assembly, which was different from the Landtag, in that, it represented ALL German states, decided, with little other choice, to offer the imperial crown to Frederick Wilhelm. Nobles in the Landtag, including Bismarck, urged him to accept. But the king rejected the proposal. And this allowed Bismarck the opportunity to rail against the constitution that would have come with it. He was BLASTED by the press, and sure of losing his seat in the next election. But when the king dissolved the Landtag, he changed the election rules for the next session, in ways that favored landowners, like Bismarck, which ensured his re-election. After giving some blistering speeches on the role of the monarchy, and some strong invectives against even the monarch's own move toward a constitutional unification, Bismarck got himself moved to a new assembly, debating the question of unification. But before that could go anywhere, he got caught up in the next great conflict; the war over territory seemed to loom between Austria and Prussia, and it is here that we see the evolution of Bismarck. Because, though, in many ways, he was, and always will be, a man of war, when a settlement was offered, and many pushed to reject it, and go to war instead, Bismarck rose, and said, ""It is unworthy of a great state, to fight for something which does not concern its own interest. Gentlemen, show me an objective worthy of war, and I will go along with you. It is easy enough for a statesman to ride the popular wave from the comfort of his own fireside, making thunderous speeches from the rostrum, letting the public sound the trumpets of war, and leaving it to the musketeer, bleeding out his life's blood in the snowy wastes, to settle whether policies end in glory, or in failure. Nothing is simpler. But, woe to any statesman, who, at such a time, fails to find a cause of war, which will stand up to scrutiny, once the fighting is over."" And so begins the transformation of Bismarck the radical, to Bismarck, man of realpolitik. Music (Art of the Possible) "
324,Education,27,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,LwBUfB7hU6A,"Every week this mystery box shows up at my doorstep. It's one of those subscription boxes, except instead of dog toys or makeup, it's food from local farmers. And I never know exactly what I'm gonna get. Got some salad greens, asparagus, and red corn..? But this wasn't always such an unusual sight. If you look through old seed catalogues like these ones, you'll see hundreds of varieties of corn, with names like ""Dibbles' Mammoth,"" ""Kendel's Early Giant,"" and my personal favorite, ""Potter's Excelsior"". But none of these varieties exist anymore. American farmers used to grow hundreds of varieties of sweet corn, tomatoes, and other edible plants. Today, just a tiny fraction of those varieties are still around. So what happened to all these plants? For most of our time on this planet, humans have been hunter gatherers. We ate what was nearby. This was still true when we invented farming 10,000 years ago, by cultivating wild plants like Teosinte in Central America and Thorn Apple in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. Over thousands of years, farmers bred these wild ancestors into foods like corn and eggplant, that we would recognize today. As humans moved around the world, so did the seeds and farmers continued to breed different varieties to adapt them to their new environments. Which led to a ton of genetic diversity. Farmers could raise different genetic varieties of different crops. If disease or pests killed one type, there were others to fall back on. But gradually industrialization and cheap fossil fuels made us less dependent on what grew well nearby. ""Food on the move, from distant parts of the world comes the great variety of foods Americans demand."" Most farmers switched from growing a variety of edible plants to a single crop that was easy to process and ship. As this model spread beyond the United States, older varieties of plants and animals disappeared from farms around the world. By 1970, 90% of the wheat varieties that had once been grown in China were gone. As were 80% of the varieties of maize or corn that were once grown in Mexico. By the summer of 1971, more than 85% of the corn planted in the US was genetically identical. Crop scientists had bred this new corn so that it grew without a tassel, making it easier to harvest. But because these plants were genetic copies of one another, that also made them susceptible to the same deadly fungus, Southern Leaf Corn Blight. It took over the US corn crop, costing farmers and taxpayers millions of dollars. And the damage would have continued, if it weren't for a humble little plant called Teosinte. The wild grass native to Oaxaca, Mexico, and the common ancestor of the 22,000 known varieties of corn. Teosinte includes a gene for resistance to the same fungus that was devastating the US corn crop. Scientists halted the damage by crossbreeding Teosinte with American corn, but that didn't totally solve the problem of genetic diversity. Today, more than 40% of the corn grown in the US is derived from just six inbred lines. And seed companies, driven by profit, can repackage genetic copies of the same seeds for different prices. Farmers plant them, thinking that they're genetically diversifying their fields when really they're not. Since the corn crisis in 1971 disease has ravaged genetically uniform crops of beans, rice tomatoes, and bananas. And it's about to get worse. The plants we eat have spent thousands of years evolving to grow in specific conditions, conditions we are changing rapidly by releasing more and more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. We depend on corn, wheat, and rice for more than 60% of our global calories. And by 2050, we'll have 2 billion more people to feed. But because of climate change, we'll actually be producing less of all three of these crops. We're going to need plants that can grow in radically different conditions and the more genetic varieties we save, the better protected we'll be. There are seed banks all over the world where scientists, indigenous communities, and farmers are all preserving older seed varieties. But thousands have already been lost, which is why it's so critical to preserve the genetic diversity we still have. The weird stuff, like red popcorn. And the best way to save the seeds that might save us one day, is to grow them and eat them. "
325,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,MASBIB7zPo4,"Here are two images of a house. There’s one obvious difference, but to this patient, P.S., they looked completely identical. P.S. had suffered a stroke that  damaged the right side of her brain, leaving her unaware of everything  on her left side. But though she could discern no difference between the houses, when researchers asked her  which she would prefer to live in, she chose the house that wasn’t burning— not once, but again and again. P.S.’s brain was still processing  information from her whole field of vision. She could see both images and tell the difference between them, she just didn’t know it. If someone threw a ball at her left side, she might duck. But she wouldn’t have any  awareness of the ball, or any idea why she ducked. P.S.’s condition, known as hemispatial neglect, reveals an important distinction between  the brain’s processing of information and our experience of that processing. That experience is what we call consciousness. We are conscious of both the external world and our internal selves— we are aware of an image in much the same way we are aware of  ourselves looking at an image, or our inner thoughts and emotions. But where does consciousness come from? Scientists, theologians, and philosophers have been trying to get to the bottom of  this question for centuries— without reaching any consensus. One recent theory is that consciousness is the brain’s imperfect  picture of its own activity. To understand this theory, it helps to have a clear idea of one important way the brain processes  information from our senses. Based on sensory input, it builds models, which are continuously updating, simplified descriptions of objects and events in the world. Everything we know is based  on these models. They never capture every detail of  the things they describe, just enough for the brain to determine  appropriate responses. For instance, one model built deep  into the visual system codes white light as brightness  without color. In reality, white light includes wavelengths that correspond to all the different colors we can see. Our perception of white light is wrong and oversimplified, but good enough for us to function. Likewise, the brain’s model of the  physical body keeps track of the configuration  of our limbs, but not of individual cells or even muscles, because that level of information isn’t needed to plan movement. If it didn’t have the model keeping track of the body’s size, shape, and how it is moving at any moment, we would quickly injure ourselves. The brain also needs models of itself. For example, the brain has the ability to pay attention to specific objects and events. It also controls that focus, shifting it from one thing to another, internal and external, according to our needs. Without the ability to direct our focus, we wouldn’t be able to assess threats,  finish a meal, or function at all. To control focus effectively, the brain has to construct a model of its own attention. With 86 billion neurons constantly interacting with each other, there’s no way the brain’s model of its own information processing can be perfectly self-descriptive. But like the model of the body, or our conception of white light, it doesn’t have to be. Our certainty that we have a metaphysical, subjective experience may come from one of the brain’s models, a cut-corner description of what it means to process information in a focused and deep manner. Scientists have already begun trying to figure out how the brain creates that self model. MRI studies are a promising avenue  for pinpointing the networks involved. These studies compare patterns  of neural activation when someone is and isn’t conscious  of a sensory stimulus, like an image. The results show that the areas needed  for visual processing are activated whether or not the  participant is aware of the image, but a whole additional network lights up only when they are conscious of seeing the image. Patients with hemispatial neglect,  like P.S., typically have damage to one particular  part of this network. More extensive damage to the network  can sometimes lead to a vegetative state, with no sign of consciousness. Evidence like this brings us closer to understanding how consciousness is built into the brain, but there’s still much more to learn. For instance, the way neurons in the networks  related to consciousness compute specific pieces of information is outside the scope of our current technology. As we approach questions of consciousness  with science, we’ll open new lines of inquiry  into human identity. "

But of all the U.S. presidents accused of misusing that power, only one has left office as a result. Does Richard Nixon deserve to be remembered for more than the scandal that ended his presidency? Find out as we put this disgraced president's legacy on trial in History vs. Richard Nixon. ""Order, order. Now, who's the defendant today, some kind of crook?"" ""Cough. No, your Honor. This is Richard Milhous Nixon, the 37th president of the United States, who served from 1969 to 1974."" ""Hold on. That's a weird number of years for a president to serve."" ""Well, you see, President Nixon resigned for the good of the nation and was pardoned by President Ford, who took over after him."" ""He resigned because he was about to be impeached, and he didn't want the full extent of his crimes exposed."" ""And what were these crimes?"" ""Your Honor, the Watergate scandal was one of the grossest abuses of presidential power in history. Nixon's men broke into the Democratic National Committee headquarters to wiretap the offices and dig up dirt on opponents for the reelection campaign."" ""Cough It was established that the President did not order this burglary."" ""But as soon as he learned of it, he did everything to cover it up, while lying about it for months."" ""Uh, yes, but it was for the good of the country. He did so much during his time in office and could have done so much more without a scandal jeopardizing his accomplishments."" ""Uh, accomplishments?"" ""Yes, your Honor. Did you know it was President Nixon who proposed the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, and signed the National Environmental Policy Act into law? Not to mention the Endangered Species Act, Marine Mammal Protection Act, expansion of the Clean Air Act."" ""Sounds pretty progressive of him."" ""Progressive? Hardly. Nixon's presidential campaign courted Southern voters through fear and resentment of the civil rights movement."" ""Speaking of civil rights, the prosecution may be surprised to learn that he signed the Title IX amendment, banning gender-based discrimination in education, and ensured that desegregation of schools occurred peacefully, and he lowered the voting age to 18, so that students could vote."" ""He didn't have much concern for students after four were shot by the National Guard at Kent State. Instead, he called them bums for protesting the Vietnam War, a war he had campaigned on ending."" ""But he did end it."" ""He ended it two years after taking office. Meanwhile, his campaign had sabotaged the previous president's peace talks, urging the South Vietnamese government to hold out for supposedly better terms, which, I might add, didn't materialize. So, he protracted the war for four years, in which 20,000 more U.S. troops, and over a million more Vietnamese, died for nothing."" ""Hmm, a presidential candidate interfering in foreign negotiations -- isn't that treason?"" ""It is, your Honor, a clear violation of the Logan Act of 1799."" ""Uh, I think we're forgetting President Nixon's many foreign policy achievements. It was he who normalized ties with China, forging economic ties that continue today."" ""Are we so sure that's a good thing? And don't forget his support of the coup in Chile that replaced the democratically-elected President Allende with a brutal military dictator."" ""It was part of the fight against communism."" ""Weren't tyranny and violence the reasons we opposed communism to begin with? Or was it just fear of the lower class rising up against the rich?"" ""President Nixon couldn't have predicted the violence of Pinochet's regime, and being anti-communist didn't mean neglecting the poor. He proposed a guaranteed basic income for all American families, still a radical concept today. And he even pushed for comprehensive healthcare reform, just the kind that passed 40 years later."" ""I'm still confused about this burglary business. Was he a crook or not?"" ""Your Honor, President Nixon may have violated a law or two, but what was the real harm compared to all he accomplished while in office?"" ""The harm was to democracy itself. The whole point of the ideals Nixon claimed to promote abroad is that leaders are accountable to the people, and when they hold themselves above the law for whatever reason, those ideals are undermined."" ""And if you don't hold people accountable to the law, I'll be out of a job."" Many politicians have compromised some principles to achieve results, but law-breaking and cover-ups threaten the very fabric the nation is built on. Those who do so may find their entire legacy tainted when history is put on trial. "
327,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Mc6VA7Q1vXQ,"It's a good day to be a pirate. Amaro and his four mateys, Bart, Charlotte, Daniel, and Eliza have struck gold: a chest with 100 coins. But now, they must divvy up the booty according to the pirate code. As captain, Amaro gets to propose how to distribute the coins. Then, each pirate,  including Amaro himself, gets to vote either yarr or nay. If the vote passes, or if there's a tie, the coins are divided according to plan. But if the majority votes nay, Amaro must walk the plank and Bart becomes captain. Then, Bart gets to propose a new distribution and all remaining pirates vote again. If his plan is rejected, he walks the plank, too, and Charlotte takes his place. This process repeats, with the captain's hat moving to Daniel and then Eliza until either a proposal is accepted or there's only one pirate left. Naturally, each pirate wants to stay alive while getting as much gold as possible. But being pirates, none of them trust each other, so they can't collaborate in advance. And being blood-thirsty pirates, if anyone thinks they'll end up with the same amount of gold either way, they'll vote to make the captain walk the plank just for fun. Finally, each pirate is excellent at logical deduction and knows that the others are, too. What distribution should Amaro propose to make sure he lives? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 If we follow our intuition, it seems like Amaro should try to bribe the other pirates with most of the gold to increase the chances of his plan being accepted. But it turns out he can do much better than that. Why? Like we said, the pirates all know each other to be top-notch logicians. So when each votes, they won't just be thinking about the current proposal, but about all possible outcomes down the line. And because the rank order is known in advance, each can accurately predict how the others would vote in any situation and adjust their own votes accordingly. Because Eliza's last, she has the most outcomes to consider, so let's start by following  her thought process. She'd reason this out by working backwards from the last possible scenario with only her and Daniel remaining. Daniel would obviously propose to keep all the gold and Eliza's one vote would not be enough to override him, so Eliza wants to avoid this situation at all costs. Now we move to the previous decision point with three pirates left and Charlotte making the proposal. Everyone knows that if she's outvoted, the decision moves to Daniel, who will then get all the gold while Eliza gets nothing. So to secure Eliza's vote, Charlotte only needs to offer her slightly more than nothing, one coin. Since this ensures her support, Charlotte doesn't need to offer Daniel anything at all. What if there are four pirates? As captain, Bart would still only need one other vote for his plan to pass. He knows that Daniel wouldn't want  the decision to pass to Charlotte, so he would offer Daniel one coin for his support with nothing for Charlotte or Eliza. Now we're back at the initial vote with all five pirates standing. Having considered all the other scenarios, Amaro knows that if he goes overboard, the decision comes down to Bart, which would be bad news  for Charlotte and Eliza. So he offers them one coin each, keeping 98 for himself. Bart and Daniel vote nay, but Charlotte and Eliza  grudgingly vote yarr knowing that the alternative  would be worse for them. The pirate game involves some interesting concepts from game theory. One is the concept of common knowledge where each person is aware of what the others know and uses this to predict their reasoning. And the final distribution is an example of a Nash equilibrium where each player knows every other players' strategy and chooses theirs accordingly. Even though it may lead to a worse outcome for everyone than cooperating would, no individual player can benefit by changing their strategy. So it looks like Amaro gets to keep most of the gold, and the other pirates might need to find better ways to use those impressive logic skills, like revising this absurd pirate code. "
328,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,MknV3t5QbUc,"A few months ago we posed a challenge  to our community. We asked everyone: given a range of  integers from 0 to 100, guess the whole number closest to 2/3  of the average of all numbers guessed. So if the average of all guesses is 60,  the correct guess will be 40. What number do you think was the  correct guess at 2/3 of the average? Let’s see if we can try and reason  our way to the answer. This game is played under conditions known to game theorists as common knowledge. Not only does every player have the same information — they also know that everyone else does, and that everyone else knows that  everyone else does, and so on, infinitely. Now, the highest possible average would  occur if every person guessed 100. In that case, 2/3 of the average  would be 66.66. Since everyone can figure this out, it wouldn’t make sense to guess anything higher than 67. If everyone playing comes to  this same conclusion, no one will guess higher than 67. Now 67 is the new highest  possible average, so no reasonable guess should be  higher than ⅔ of that, which is 44. This logic can be extended further  and further. With each step, the highest possible  logical answer keeps getting smaller. So it would seem sensible to guess the  lowest number possible. And indeed, if everyone chose zero, the game would reach what’s known as a Nash Equilibrium. This is a state where every player has chosen the best possible strategy for themselves given  everyone else playing, and no individual player can benefit  by choosing differently. But, that’s not what happens  in the real world. People, as it turns out, either aren’t  perfectly rational, or don’t expect each other  to be perfectly rational. Or, perhaps, it’s some combination  of the two. When this game is played in real-world settings, the average tends to be somewhere  between 20 and 35. Danish newspaper Politiken ran the game  with over 19,000 readers participating, resulting in an average of roughly 22,  making the correct answer 14. For our audience, the average was 31.3. So if you guessed 21 as 2/3 of the average, well done. Economic game theorists have a way of modeling this interplay between rationality and practicality called k-level reasoning. K stands for the number of times a cycle of reasoning is repeated. A person playing at k-level 0 would approach our game naively, guessing a number at random without thinking about the other players. At k-level 1, a player would assume everyone else was playing at level 0, resulting in an average of 50, and thus guess 33. At k-level 2, they’d assume that everyone else was playing at level 1, leading them to guess 22. It would take 12 k-levels to reach 0. The evidence suggests that most people stop at 1 or 2 k-levels. And that’s useful to know, because k-level thinking comes into  play in high-stakes situations. For example, stock traders evaluate stocks not only based on earnings reports, but also on the value that others  place on those numbers. And during penalty kicks in soccer, both the shooter and the goalie decide whether to go right or left based on what they think the other person is thinking. Goalies often memorize the patterns of their opponents ahead of time, but penalty shooters know that and can plan accordingly. In each case, participants must weigh their own understanding of the best course of action against how well they think other participants understand the situation. But 1 or 2 k-levels is by no means  a hard and fast rule— simply being conscious of this tendency can make people adjust their expectations. For instance, what would happen if people played the 2/3 game after understanding the difference between the most logical approach and the most common? Submit your own guess at what 2/3  of the new average will be by using the form below, and we’ll find out. "
329,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,My6oGvkHnfY,"Is it a flying comma, or a quotation mark chopped in half? Either way, you may already be well-versed in how to use the apostrophe, but here's a quick refresher on its usage. The apostrophe can be used in three ways: to mark possession, to mark contraction, to mark the plural of single letters. Most of the time, if you see an apostrophe hovering helpfully near a word, it's trying to mark possession  or contraction. First, let's look at how the apostrophe marks possession. As you can see, the placement of this punctuation mark can really change the meaning of a sentence. ""Those robots in  the sand are my sister's."" ""Those robots in  the sand are my sisters.'"" ""Those robots in the sand are my sisters."" When showing possession, the apostrophe belongs next to the noun that owns or possesses something. The noun can be singular or plural. Proper nouns work, too. So if Lucy needs to get her robots under control before they cause mayhem, those dangerous creatures would be ""Lucy's robots."" But what if Lucy was Lucas? Would we write ""Lucas' robots"" or ""Lucas's robots""? And what if Lucas gave his robots to the Robinsons family? Would it be ""The Robinsons' robots,"" or ""The Robinsons's robots""? The truth is, even grammar nerds disagree on the right thing to do. The use of 's after a proper noun ending in s is a style issue, not a hard and fast grammar rule. It's a conundrum  without a simple answer. Professional writers solve this problem by learning what's considered correct for a publication, and doing that. The important thing is to pick one style and stick with it  throughout a piece of writing. One more wrinkle. Certain pronouns already  have possession built in and don't need an apostrophe. Remembering that will help you avoid one of the trickiest snags in English grammar: its vs. it's. ""It's"" only take an apostrophe when it's a contraction for ""it is"" or ""it has."" If you can replace ""it's"" with  one of those two phrases, use the apostrophe. If you're showing possession,  leave it out. Otherwise, contractions are pretty straightforward. The apostrophe stands in  for missing letters, and lets common phrases  squash into a single word. In rare cases, you can have a double contraction, though those generally  aren't accepted in writing, with the exception of dialogue. So it's possessive,  it's often followed by s's, and it's sometimes tricky  when it comes to its usage. It's the apostrophe. "
330,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,N3vu2JYwxSY,"Last we left off, Simón had returned to Caracas. But even as he returned to his home city, burning with a new ardor for revolution and beginning to think about how to make it a reality, events were afoot in Europe. Napoleon, that great wildcard, the great overthrower of tradition, had invaded Spain (Music) Napoleonic armies, once the allies of Spain, came tearing in into the Iberian Peninsula. The King abdicated, his son was forced to put aside the Crown, Napoleon declared his own brother the King of Spain. The Court was in confusion, the army was in disarray, central authority had broken down. Small ""Juntas"" began to crop up everywhere, claiming rightful authority in Spain. But even the most legitimate of these contenders was stuck in a besieged city, surrounded by 70.000 of Napoleon's men. So what were the colonies to do? Were they now the subjects of Napoleon's brother? Or were they to submit to the will of the walled-off Junta, bottled up in Cadiz? Who knew? These question might not have been the ones foremost in the minds of Europe at the time, but in Caracas they burn through the steets. After much debate, they found a third option: they would create their own Junta and declare it in support of Ferdinand VII, the King who Napoleon had deposed. But since the King was pretty much out of the picture, and they recognized no other continental authority, this basically meant they were now independent. With that sorted, they then sent the representatives of the Central Junta of Spain packing and began self-government under a council of the leading men of Venezuela Simon was not to be found among these leading men; to them, Simon was just a youth, he was reckless, rude, a bit dissolute, and yeah he had returned recently from europe with a fire in his belly but all they figured it was just a matter of time before that fire burnt out. He was a liability. But... they were broke. They wanted to send a delegation to England, but as a newly established government and with the Napoleonic wars wreaking havoc on trade, they just didn't have the money to do it. But Bolivar! That kid was rich, like, really rich. And with all the impetuosness and  the arrogance that they came to expect of him Bolivar offered to pay for the whole trip if they would let him come along. Even with this generous offer, some at the council were worried about the idea of Bolivar being one of their official representatives to England. In the end, though, money won, and they figured: ""Well, he can't put us in too much worse a position than we are now so, why not"". Of course, just to be safe they sent him with two other, older and more respected members of the community. They figured: ""Let Bolivar spend the money, have those guys actually do the work"". So, Bolivar departed for England, looking to secure recognition and aid for his fledging nation. Upon arrival, they quickly arrange the private visit with England's Foreign Minister, they gather at his stately mansion on the edge of Hyde Park and begin the meeting. They speak in French because Bolivar, though he was acting as an emissary to England, does not know a word of English. The Foreign Minister takes the lead stating bluntly -or at least so he thinks- that he needs to know whether Venezuela is seeking total indepence or if it is still loyal to the deposed King of Spain. You see, he is trying to signal to them that the Spanish are fighting Napoleon and, therefore, they are now England's allies, which is something he can not jeopardize. So, boldly, knowing this to be his moment to shine, that he will be one to convince the English to enter in their cause, Bolivar steps forward before either of the other can respond and speaks at lengt. With elegance and passion, about the struggle that has gone into throwing off the mother country's yoke and the desire of the people to be truly free. Clearly he didn't get the hint. So, the Foreign Minister quietly sighs and figures: ""Ok, I'll try again"". This time he states, in a way that he finds too straightforward to really even be civil, than England is Spain's ally, so they need to tell him -wink, wink- that they aren't planning to totally break from the Spanish Crown. One of the others tried to step in and respond, but Bolivar was filled with passion. He knew this was his moment. He had this. He doubled down, offering his most soaring and powerful rethoric, a cry so passionate that it must move even this stone-faced Englishman, and then, at the height of the performance, in a flash of inspiration, the type of monumental genius only he was capable of, he handed the English minister the letters of introduction and the package of credentials that he had been given by the government back home, so that the minister may see his people's commitment and passion in their own words. He continued in his most stunning, gripping rethoric, as the minister leafed through the letters from his people. And then he brought it home. The ending was perfect There is no way that the minister cannot see the righteousness of their cause now. The minister was quiet. Clearly he had been stunned to silence by Bolivar's moving words. When he'd recovered himself enough to move he slowly lifted a single piece of paper out of the packet and handed it across the table. In his passion, Bolivar had accidentally handed the minister ALL  the letters from his people, including the instructions that he received from his government. And in those instructions was a note that basically read -in BOLD LETTERS-: ""ABSOLUTELY DO NOT MENTION THE IDEA OF VENEZUELEN INDEPENDENCE"" ""We are not doing that, we are loyal to the King, We are in no way going to try to break off from the King, so whatever you do do not imply that we are. Before Bolivar's jaw could hit the floor or his face could turn tomato red, the minister landed the one-two punch, sliding Simon's passport across the desk, tapping it with one finger, and saying: ""My Spanish is poor, but Isn't the nation you hail from literally called 'The Supreme Junta of Caracas dedicated to preserving the rights of the King Ferdinand the VII'?"" But then the stone-faced Englishman laughed, and said that he admired Bolivar's zeal. Still, needless to say, none of the Junta's goals were met. No concrete deal on trade or formal recognition were forthcoming. But there was another man who Bolivar met in London, A man named Francisco de Miranda. The one man in all of London whom the delegates were instructed to NOT meet. Miranda was perhaps the oldest Venezuelan freedom fighter. He was now sixty, and for decades he had been agitating for South and Central American freedom from Spain. He even once launched a catastrophicly inept attempt to liberate Venezuela by force back in 1804. And he had dreams like Bolivar had dreams. Not of some mere republic that paid lip service to a monarch back in Spain, but true and complete independence for his native land. He was now residing in London, because after his bungled attempt to take over his country by force he had taken refuge with the English. His house had become a meeting place for latinamericans in London. There, Bolivar not only met much of the upper echelons of British and ex-pat society, but he also became fast friend with Miranda himself. Soon he convinced Miranda that he needed to return to Venezuela. That the people were waiting for him to reignite the fires of revolution. But, when they did both return to Venezuela, Miranda was not greeted by a cheering crowd waiting to bestow on him the command of a newly formed republic, but rather a small group of onlookers who, for lack of anything better to do, boredly watched him get off the ship. Slightly miffed but undetered, they soon threw themselves into politics. Subborning a small political party called ""The Patriotic Society"" and using it as a platform to run the type of political campaigns that had became a staple of London but had never been seen in the southern half of the New World. They made inroads with the mixed race peoples who had been largely ignored by the Junta of rich whites. There was some ego clashing between Bolivar and Miranda, but soon all of that was overshadowed by two great events. First, a member of the newly formed congress turned out to be a spy for the Spanish regency and had fled in the night with important papers of state. This incident caused an uproar. Why defend the Spanish Government if they were spying on and thieving from Venezuela? But this incident might have blown over if it weren't for the second piece of news that followed swiftly on its heels. Wellington had defeated another of Napoleon's armies in Spain. The Spanish Government would soon truly return. This became a pivot point. One of those seminal moments in history where a decision has to be made. And make it, the Venezuelans did. They finally declared themselves truly and fully independent. But this independence was an independence by rich whites for rich whites, and, as soon as word on the inequites in its constitution spread, slave rebellions and counter revolutions spread with it. Before long, the inexperienced and inept forces of the republic were routed, and they turned to the only experienced soldier among them, Miranda, to lead their forces. He did so on one condition: That Bolivar be stripped of his rank and not allowed to participate. This was totally unexpected, to Bolivar and the ruling council Bolivar exploded in rage but there was little he could do until a sympathetic general brought him onto his staff as an adjutant. Here he served with distinction, proving his valor and value on the battlefield, so much so that Miranda allowed him to bring news of their successes back to Caracas, commending him and recommending that his rank be restored. But always in the background, in private, he said that Bolivar fought like a gorilla, undisciplined, with little of the strictures of military life for command. Things soon took a turn for the worse. Spanish officers arrived on the scene and began raising and training an army of the discontent, then an even greater tragedy struck. An earthquake of uninimagined magnitude struck Caracas. Tens of thousands of people died. The financial, cultural and political capital of the new nation was reduced to ruins. The people thought it was the punishment of God. Troops began to desert and Bolivar, who was sent to garrison a stronghold, ended up getting fired upon by the very troops that were supposed to be guarding the fort he was to protect. And through this, Miranda waged an anemic campaign, always on the retreat. Until, in a shock to everybody, he offered an unilatteral surrender. He did not consult congress, he didn't speak to Bolivar. He made the terms with the Spanish as if he were Venezuela's King. Bolivar sensed treason, could only think of it as a betrayal. And betrayal was to be met with betrayal. On the night before Miranda was to slip away, allowing himself passage on a ship while he had locked down the ports to all the other Venezuelans, Bolivar and a group of his friends seized Miranda and turned him over to the local constable, who soon turnde him over to the Spanish. Miranda would die in a prison a few years later, tossed into a mass grave like a common criminal. But Bolivar, in the chaos, somehow managed to slip away before the arrival of the Spanish forces. His family connections kept him safe, And he plotted his next move in a fight he considered far from finished. The fight for Venezuelan independence. (Music) "
331,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,N5PTeDe4jTQ,"[Theme Music] The year is 1941. World War II is entering its third year, France has collapsed, and Great Britain is barely holding on. A last bulwark of democracy against the tide of fascism. Dictatorship rules Europe, and the sleeping giant of the United States has yet to wake. With the collapse of France in 1940, the situation in Europe becomes clear. Without resources from the U.S, all resistance to the Nazi military machine would collapse. No matter how bravely the small island nation of Britain tried to hold out. But America was opposed to war. In fact it goes further. America was opposed to any intervention at all. In the 1930s, the U.S had passed the Neutrality Act. Which not only established that it wasn't going to get involved with foreign wars, But went further, with the prevailing American isolationism of the time, and declared that America wasn't going to sell arms  to nations at war. President Roosevelt saw the threat that Nazi Germany posed, and desperately wanted to find ways to support the British war effort. But the Neutrality Act kept his hands tied. When Czechoslovakia fell, he lobbied Congress to renew an old prevision in the Neutrality Act, called Cash and Carry. But, his efforts were rebuffed. Then, Poland fell. And things started to look grim. Finally, on November 5th, 1939, Cash and Carry was renewed. But, Cash and Carry was a limited provision. It allowed for the sale of material to Britain and France, but only if they paid in cash for the material, and transported it all back to Europe themselves. No U.S ship was to enter a war zone. At first, this worked. But as the years dragged on, and France fell, Britain found itself hemorrhaging its reserves. The Battle of Britain, and the campaigning in North Africa had been bleeding it dry. There simply was no more cash in the U.K. And even the British Fleet was being stretched thin. In 1940, Roosevelt established a policy allowing the trade of destroyers to the British, in exchange for bases in British colonies. This policy was definitely pushing the limits of the Neutrality Act, But, technically, it wasn't violating the terms of Cash and Carry. Because the British were trading for the ships rather than buying them, and, hey, ships do a pretty good job of transporting themselves. So... there ya go. This deal really shows the desperation of the situation though. Roosevelt risked a potentially illegal action, because everyone: His staff, and even much of the British staff, saw the capitulation of the British Empire as inevitable. In 1940, everyone thought Britain was on the ropes, mere weeks from being taken down. And so, as a last ""Hail Mary"", this destroyers-for-bases deal put U.S bases on British colonies, so that they wouldn't simply fall into Nazi hands. But, fortunately, the Battle of Britain was won, And now, the U.S had to enter into more long term thinking. It was time for Lend-Lease. This is one of the critical turning points in the second World War. It's right up there with the German invasion of the Soviet Union, and the United States finally deciding to fully commit to war. Without Lend-Lease, the U.K almost certainly would have fallen. Fascists would gain control over all of Europe, and even if the U.S later decided to enter the war, they'd have no jumping-off point for a European Campaign. But, Lend-Lease, at last meant that the complete industrial power of the U.S would be committed to combating the Nazi War Machine. With Lend-Lease, the U.S had finally picked a side. Y'see, the idea behind Lend-Lease was simple. The U.S would give its strategic partners- And I say ""strategic partners"" because they're not Allies yet- massive amounts of war material for the duration of the war. After which, these ""strategic partners"" were supposed to give that material back. Funny thing about war material though, not a lot of it tends to come back in the same condition you lent it out in. And the U.S knew this. This was essentially the largest donation of war material in the history of mankind. And it wasn't just tanks and bombs. It was foodstuffs and telephone cabling. It was trucks and clothing. Heck, the U.S even shipped 2000 locomotives and 11,000 train cars over to the USSR to bolster their rail infrastructure. This was a huge portion of the U.S economy going to cover the material cost of the war. While other nations were carrying the bulk of the human cost. And the sheer size of this effort is indescribable. It helped to drag the U.S out of the Great Depression, and galvanized American production. It meant sending millions of tons overseas, shipping on a scale heretofore unimaginable during times of war. It meant giving away more goods than the entire world would have been able to produce annually a mere 75 years before. But, like all things, this decision wasn't as straightforward as we sometimes like to think of it. Looking back on it today, it's easy to see the results of this Herculean task and how fully America threw herself into the effort, and just assume that the entire nation was unified behind this cause. That it had broad support. But democracies are, by design, messy things, and even on the issue of Lend-Lease, voting in the U.S Congress was split almost exactly down party lines. But once the measure was passed, America really did embrace this decision to truly be the arsenal of democracy. To be the engine of war for the anti-fascist world. And that leads me to a particular group I'd like to talk about. A group who's too rarely remembered and celebrated. A group whose battles were rarely glorious. They never took cities or gained territory, but they're the group of Americans who risked their lives earliest. And sacrificed the most. They had higher casualty percentages than any of the other American Armed Services during the war. And they, very arguably, saved the free world. I would like to take this moment to acknowledge the service of the Merchant Marine. These are the men and women who serve as sailors to transport goods during wartime. They served in unarmed civilian ships, hauling necessary supplies to Allied Forces throughout the war. Sailing the Atlantic, everyday they faced the harrowing dread of the submarine. At any moment, they might lose their lives to an unseen and invisible vessel far below the waves. They served simply as prey. Unable to fight back against an enemy that might- at any time- strike without warning. To die asphyxiating in a steel tomb, or freezing in the unforgiving waters of the Atlantic, are horrors that no one would want to face. And yet, these sailors faced that everyday. Not for glory, but simply because it was a job that needed to be done. And these threats were so real and omnipresent, that the Merchant Marine became one of the first uses of statistical operations research. The frequency of attacks on the Merchant Marine presented enough data for decisions to be made about the optimal size of a convoy, And the escort it might require. Evidence all gathered off the backs of broken ships, and drowned sailors. But despite all of this, many of the men and women of the Merchant Marines signed up for voyage after voyage. Returning to the seas to make sure that the material of Lend-Lease always got through. And though the U.S wouldn't officially enter the war for nine more months, Lend-Lease made members of the Merchant Marines some of the first U.S citizens to give their lives for the Allied Cause in World War II. And in doing so, though their sacrifice is rarely celebrated, they helped change the course of history. Join us next week, as we look more closely at how the lack of specific natural resources drove Axis policy. And explore how many of the synthetic products we know today came to be during the second world war. [Ending Music] "
332,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,NKmGVE85GUU,"In the world of math, many strange results are possible when we change the rules. But there’s one rule that most of us have been warned not to break: don’t divide by zero. How can the simple combination  of an everyday number and a basic operation cause such problems? Normally, dividing by smaller  and smaller numbers gives you bigger and bigger answers. Ten divided by two is five, by one is ten, by one-millionth is 10 million, and so on. So it seems like if you divide by numbers that keep shrinking all the way down to zero, the answer will grow  to the largest thing possible. Then, isn’t the answer to 10  divided by zero actually infinity? That may sound plausible. But all we really know is  that if we divide 10 by a number that tends towards zero, the answer tends towards infinity. And that’s not the same thing as saying that 10 divided by zero is equal to infinity. Why not? Well, let’s take a closer look at what division really means. Ten divided by two could mean, ""How many times must  we add two together to make 10,” or, “two times what equals 10?” Dividing by a number is essentially the reverse of multiplying by it, in the following way: if we multiply any number  by a given number x, we can ask if there’s a new number  we can multiply by afterwards to get back to where we started. If there is, the new number is called the multiplicative inverse of x. For example, if you multiply three by two to get six, you can then multiply by one-half to get back to three. So the multiplicative inverse of two is one-half, and the multiplicative inverse  of 10 is one-tenth. As you might notice, the product of any number and its multiplicative inverse is always one. If we want to divide by zero, we need to find its multiplicative inverse, which should be one over zero. This would have to be such a number that multiplying it by zero would give one. But because anything multiplied by zero is still zero, such a number is impossible, so zero has no multiplicative inverse. Does that really settle things, though? After all, mathematicians have broken rules before. For example, for a long time, there was no such thing as taking  the square root of negative numbers. But then mathematicians defined  the square root of negative one as a new number called i, opening up a whole new mathematical world of complex numbers. So if they can do that, couldn’t we just make up a new rule, say, that the symbol infinity means one over zero, and see what happens? Let's try it, imagining we don’t know  anything about infinity already. Based on the definition  of a multiplicative inverse, zero times infinity must be equal to one. That means zero times infinity plus zero times infinity should equal two. Now, by the distributive property, the left side of the equation  can be rearranged to zero plus zero times infinity. And since zero plus zero  is definitely zero, that reduces down to zero times infinity. Unfortunately, we’ve already defined this as equal to one, while the other side of the equation is still telling us it’s equal to two. So, one equals two. Oddly enough, that's not necessarily wrong; it's just not true in our normal world of numbers. There’s still a way it could be mathematically valid, if one, two, and every other number were equal to zero. But having infinity equal to zero is ultimately not all that useful  to mathematicians, or anyone else. There actually is something called  the Riemann sphere that involves dividing by zero  by a different method, but that’s a story for another day. In the meantime, dividing by zero in the most obvious way doesn’t work out so great. But that shouldn’t stop us from living dangerously and experimenting  with breaking mathematical rules to see if we can invent  fun, new worlds to explore. "
333,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,NSL55lOwznU,"Whether she’s describing  bickering families, quiet declarations of love, or juicy gossip, Jane Austen’s writing often feels as though it was written just for you. Her dry wit and cheeky playfulness informs her heroines, whose conversational tone welcomes readers with a conspiratorial wink. It’s even been said that some readers feel like the author’s secret confidante, trading letters with their delightfully  wicked friend Jane. But this unique brand of  tongue-in-cheek humor is just one of the many feats found  in her sly satires of society, civility, and sweeping romance. Written in the early nineteenth century, Austen's novels decode  the sheltered lives of the upper classes in rural England. From resentment couched in pleasantries to arguing that masks attraction, her work explores the bewildering collision of emotions and etiquette. But while romance is a common thread in her work, Austen dismissed the sentimental style of writing so popular at the time. Instead of lofty love stories, her characters act naturally,  and often awkwardly. They trade pragmatic advice,  friendly jokes and not-so-friendly barbs about their arrogant peers. As they grapple with the endless rules of their society, Austen’s characters can usually find humor in all the hypocrisy, propriety,  and small talk. As Mr. Bennet jokes to his favorite daughter, “For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors and laugh at them in our turn?” And though her heroines might ridicule  senseless social mores, Austen fully understood the practical  importance of maintaining appearances. At the time she was writing, a wealthy marriage was a financial necessity for most young women, and she often explores the tension between the mythical quest for love, and the economic benefits  of making a match. The savvy socialite Mary Crawford sums  this up in ""Mansfield Park;"" “I would have everybody marry  if they can do it properly: I do not like to have people  throw themselves away.” Unsurprisingly, these themes were also  present in Austen’s personal life. Born in 1775, she lived in the social circles  found in her novels. Jane's parents supported her education, and provided space for her to write and publish her work anonymously. But writing was hardly lucrative work. And although she had sparks of chemistry, she never married. Elements of her circumstances can be found in many of her characters; often intelligent women with witty,  pragmatic personalities, and rich inner lives. These headstrong heroines provide  an entertaining anchor for their tumultuous romantic narratives. Like the irreverent Elizabeth Bennet of ""Pride and Prejudice,"" whose devotion to her sisters’ love lives blinds her to a clumsy suitor. Or the iron-willed Anne Elliot  of ""Persuasion,"" who chooses to remain unmarried  after the disappearance of her first love. And Elinor Dashwood, who fiercely protects her family at the cost of her own desires in ""Sense and Sensibility."" These women all encounter  difficult choices about romantic, filial, and financial stability, and they resolve them without  sacrificing their values– or their sense of humor. Of course, these characters  are far from perfect. They often think they have  all the answers. And by telling the story from their perspective, Austen tricks the viewer into believing their heroine knows best– only to pull the rug out from under the protagonist and the reader. In ""Emma,"" the titular character feels surrounded by dull neighbors, and friends who can’t hope  to match her wit. As her guests prattle on and  on about nothing, the reader begins to agree– Emma is the only exciting character  in this quiet neighborhood. Yet despite her swelling ego, Emma may not be as in control as she thinks – in life or love. And Austen’s intimate use of perspective makes these revelations doubly surprising, blindsiding both Emma and her audience. But rather than diminishing her host of heroines, these flaws only confirm “the inconsistency of all human characters.” Their complexity has kept Austen prominent on stage and screen, and made her work easily adaptable for modern sensibilities. So hopefully, new readers will continue to find a friend in Ms. Austen for many years to come. "
334,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,NYv-GC8DgMk,"Cicero once said that the ""Sinews of war were infinite money."" Never has that been more true than in the second World War. This little bonus extra history series is going to be all about the complex economic struggle that underpinned the most colossal conflict in human history. These episodes are happening courtesy of the good folks at Paradox. who, after seeing those old Punic Wars episodes we made, approached us asking to sponsor a few episodes about the economic aspects of World War II. in anticipation of the upcoming release of Hearts Of Iron 4. And it's a great topic idea, so lets jump right in. First, let me set the stage. The year is 1939 Storm clouds are gathering over Europe. Hitler has already grabbed Austria, And Czechoslovakia is being gobbled up. The Italians have conquered Albania. Even as many tried to deny it, every nation knows. War is coming. Meanwhile, in the east, the Japanese have annexed Manchuria, and are pushing further into China. Chinese resistance movements have flared up. For all intents and purposes, the east is already at war. But most of the major players all have one goal in mind. Resources. Economic power, industrial installations, natural resources. These all needed to be gathered and hoarded as quickly as possible, because every state knows when war truly breaks all bounds, all the trade that keeps the world economy functioning will grind to a halt. Or so it was thought, in fact, many expected that the European nations would avoid war because their economies couldn't survive economic isolation. But, that assumption hadn't kept the first World War from breaking out. And it wouldn't keep the second. In truth, many of the pre-war planners had learned from the first World War And started preparing for just such a breakdown in trade years in advance. So let's take a look at the economies of some of the major players right at the outset of the war. The first big three are Germany,  France, and Great Britain. These are the major European nations that would be in direct conflict with each other from the get go. Germany, having been disarmed after World War I, had come roaring out of the Great Depression with One of the largest armaments programs the world had ever seen. France had invested heavily in static defenses. And Great Britain had restarted its fleet construction program, after the lull from the Washington naval treaty. But to really compare these countries we're going to have to talk numbers. The way I see it, there are four statistics you really have to consider when talking about countries involved in a  global war. First, GDP. Or Gross Domestic Product. This tells you roughly how big an economy is. How much raw production it's capable of. Which, of course, translates directly into tanks, bombs, guns, the materiel of war. Second, population. When we're looking at massive global conflicts that are gonna determine the very survival of nations, you've gotta look at the manpower they can draw upon. The larger the population, the larger the armies that nation can field. With more of industrialized countries being able to draw on larger sections of their populace without disrupting the flow of basic goods like grain. If a conflict becomes a long term struggle population count becomes increasingly important as attrition starts to mount. Third, territorial extent. This isn't a perfect measure by any stretch, but it serves to give us a surface level idea of relative natural resource control. In modern economies that require every thing from oil, to rubber, to aluminum to run. Territorial extent gives us a very rough idea of how self sufficient these economies might be if cut off from global trade. It also tells us how much ground a nation can give up without being knocked out of the fight. Though, it is worth noting that greater territorial extent also generally makes mobilization more difficult. And defense more complex, so it's kind of a trade-off in some ways. Fourth, per capita income. Individual wage may seem like a strange metric when thinking of war time economy, but it gives you a good idea of how developed an economy is. The higher the individual wage, the more advanced an economy you're usually dealing with. And this is actually super important, because in general, larger economies can take bigger hits without crumbling. Bombing one factory won't cause production to grind to a halt. They'll have a greater ability to synthesize or find alternatives for natural resources they don't have. They have a better internal network for transportation and distribution and such. So a nation that has a more advanced economy, even if it has the same GDP as another country, it can remain an effective combatant much longer than a nation with a less advanced economy. This is why china collapsed into a guerrilla war almost immediately, rather than fronting a centralized state effort. And it's why Italy capitulated so much quicker than Germany. It's also fascinating to think about in terms of the incredible Soviet effort to actually to pick up and move their entire industrial base in the face of a German invasion. But we'll get to that later. For right now, let's look at some numbers. Now all of the monetary figures I'm going to use here are in 1990 U.S dollars. Just because thats how the most comprehensive data set I found converted it So, the U.K has a population of 47 and a half million. A territorial reach of 245 thousand square kilometers. A GDP of 284.2 billion dollars. And a per capita income of about 5,983 dollars. Now, when compared to Germany's numbers with a population of 68.6 million 473 thousand square kilometers of territory A GDP of 351.4 billion And a per capita income of 5,126 per head The U.K's numbers may look a bit low, but first we've gotta factor in France. Which had a population of 42 million. A territorial reach of 551 thousand square kilometers. A GDP of 185.6 billion, and a per capita income 4,424 dollars. And perhaps far more importantly, we also have to factor in the British empire. If you add in all of the colonies and dominions that Britain held at the time, that's a whopping 483.8 million people 34,179,000 square kilometers in territory, and 391 billion in GDP. But granted, if you leave out some of the more economically advanced dominions like Canada and Australia, the colonies' collective per capita GDP was only 627 dollars. So, less great. Sorry, I know that was a lot of numbers, but what does it all tell us? All of those numbers basically tell us that Germany needed to win this war before the U.K could bring it's empire to bear. But it also tells us that British empire was unwieldy. It was spread out and had an incredibly low per capita GDP in a lot of places. which meant that there wasn't a lot in those places that could be diverted to war production. and those sections of the empire would probably collapse at the first show of hostile force. And that reality very much played into the overarching strategy of the war. Blitzkrieg was not only a tactical or even a strategic idea but an operational one. Germany had stockpiled materiel before the war. They believed that they had better military leadership, and better esprit de corps Their great hope was to expand fast enough using those early advantages to win total victory, But their more realistic planning told them that they still had no choice but to expand rapidly. So that they could bring in the resources, population, and industrial capacity that they would need to fight a protracted war. Seizing an early advantage was Germany's best chance. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, Japan was in much the same situation. The famous Japanese admiral Yamamoto estimated that he could win for 6 months If the U.S entered the war. But if Japan had not secured victory by then, loss was assured. If we look at the statistics for Japan and China, which I'll put down below just so I don't belabor you with more numbers We can see that China has a substantially higher population, and thus also a higher GDP but, a much lower per capita GDP. Meaning that China would probably lose a conventional war but they'd still be very hard to occupy if they got any outside help. And then there were the two wildcards. The United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had vast natural resources, a huge population and a high GDP. but, with a low per capita wage. Meaning they had a less advanced economy than many of the other European powers. Russia would play an enormous role in the struggle to come, But economically it's entire focus would be using what industrial resources it had to arm and equip the vast forces it could muster. The United States on the other hand, for the entire length of the war, From 1938, well before it was involved, to the war's conclusion in 1945 Had a GDP greater than every major Axis power combined. A GDP which was also greater than all the other major Allies put together. Not only that, but the U.S was protected by oceans from the conflict itself. This is why the United States would serve as the arsenal of democracy. Join us next time as we talk about Lend-Lease, and how American industrial output would be used to keep its beleaguered soon to be Allies afloat, before the American nation gathered the will to fight. See ya then. "
335,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,NZsAWciOS4w,"We all know that games don't always get the best rap, Especially when it comes to educators who might not have grown up with them. But today, we want to share the story of our teacher friend Patrick, Who used this medium to encourage inclusion in his classroom. My name is Patrick and I'm a high school English teacher. I'm humbled by how often I hear the phrase, ""Teachers can change lives"". Education does have a transformative power that can sent young minds on a path unforeseen By unlocking skills or talents that kids didn't even know were there. But, can video games change lives? The perennial time-waster, the notorious brain rotter, The scourge of parents and teachers everywhere. Well, after what happened in my classroom, I can without a doubt, I can without a doubt, say yes they can. Two years ago. I taught a group of freshmen first thing in the morning. Normally, period one is a little rough, since most of the kids are still waking up. But this group was different as soon as that bell rang on the first day. I could clearly see this was a spirited bunch They were chatty but respectful and full of character and energy to start things off We played an icebreaker game to learn everyone's names and to share something interesting about ourselves One kid was the goalie for our hockey team? One kid loved Bob Marley one kid was training to be a professional ice skater and one kid well She didn't have much to say I had to ask her for her name twice because I couldn't hear her the first time To be honest, I think she felt overwhelmed by all of the big personalities in the room, so I didn't push too hard I thought to myself no problem. It's only the first day I'm sure she just needs a little time to settle in and she'll come out of her shell when she feels ready So, the first few weeks of school go by, and period one continued to be the brightest and loudest part of my day. One kid had a meme of the day for the entire year. Another kid had an impressive collection of bowties. And one kid still didn't have much to say. By now it was the middle of October, and I still knew next to nothing about this young woman. Everyday, I tried to make a connection with her and every day I could barely get a word out. I watched helplessly as her grade in my class began to drop. I knew she was struggling with the reading, but she wouldn't respond to my offers for extra help. I was beginning to lose hope. When at last, the answer came to me on the first cold day of the school year The bell rang as it always did at 7:41. And the kids came into the room as they always do. Some kids clutch styrofoam coffee cups. Some kids chatted about the football game from the night before. And one kid was wearing a very special hoodie. It was a swirl of dark blues and purples, There was some lettering I couldn't quite make out and, 'Was that- stained glass on the back?' And then I saw the spiky hair, big yellow shoes, And of course, the Keyblade. I knew just what to do. At the time we were studying The Odyssey and I was teaching the traits of the epic hero. We were nearing the end of Odysseus's tale, And their assignment was to compare a modern character with Odysseus, and the stages of the hero's journey. As the class began brainstorming, and prewriting, My shy student flipped through her notes absently. I pulled up a chair and asked her if she had any characters in mind. She reluctantly shook her head I then asked if she knew of a character who had to travel far from home and became separated from his loved ones. A character who had to face a series of difficult trials in order to get back to them. She hesitated and shrugged her shoulders again. I could sense that she did have a character in mind, but was too embarrassed to admit it. Then I leaned in and said quietly just so she could hear: ""Are you sure?"" ""What if that character possesed a very special weapon, ""Maybe- I don't know, in the shape of a key?"" I will never forget the look of surprise, recognition, and relief in her face. She realized what I was doing. She looked up from her notes, and actually made eye contact with me for the first time. ""Kingdom Hearts!"" When she said the title, she was confirming that I was indeed hinting at her favorite video game, But also, she was asking if video games could actually have a place in the classroom and her writing. My answer was this: ""You know, I once wrote a paper in college comparing Jason and the Argonauts to Commander Shepard and his crew in Mass Effect."" Her jaw hit the floor. I believe this was truly a revelation for her that she could use video games as a way to make connections in the classroom. And not only that, her teacher was encouraging it. She began writing faster than I had ever seen before. It was as if a floodgate had opened and her mind and her hands had been unshackled. And from then on, she was one of my most active students in my class And her grades improved significantly. She was noticeably more comfortable around others. She shared her world with us and she felt vindicated. A videogame changed this girl's life. Not because her grades got better, But because through it, she learned to become much more confident overall. And by the time she was a senior She was heavily involved in our theater program and is now pursuing a degree in stagecraft. As a teacher, it's always my goal to help change my students lives for the better But in this case, it was actually Sora and the Keyblade that unlocked her true potential. Thanks, Patrick for sharing your story with us. We think educators like you who know how positive of force games can be, and who take the time to engage in individual students interests are pretty darn heroic in their own right. Even Sam's Keyblade. "

Had a lasting influence, but also young enough that this bird's eye view won't take us years to get through now Now we're not gonna go strictly by chronological order with this because I think it'll be more helpful to focus on the larger movements or eras of sci-fi Many of which overlap or are smeared out along  great swathes of time And we are inevitably going to miss some things and gloss over others simply for the sake of time, but don't worry We'll be coming back to everything when this mighty overview is done So let's get extra sci-fi started again without further ado imagine a world where machines can transmit information across long distances Where carriages  are pulled not by horses, but by engines relying on combustion? Imagine a world where  electrically powered ships can sail below the surface of the sea and heavier-than-air vessels sail the skies Jules Verne imagined all these things that was his incredible strength where Mary Shelley and to an even greater degree H.G. Wells used science fiction to project out and see the moral ramifications of our technology Jules Verne extrapolated the possible future applications of the science of the day and guessed at the marvels people might produce from the things we were so Rapidly learning  about the world Shelley to me is the true progenitor of science fiction? But Jules Verne's way of viewing the world allowed him to erect one of the great pillars of sci-fi Upon which so much other science fiction will be built in the episodes on Frankenstein we talked about how Shelley brought to us a genre distinct from myth or fantasy by creating  a place where the fantastic  can still happen, but within the realm of the possible today in discussing  Jules Verne We are gonna talk about  the originator of hard sci-fi the man who took this idea of the possible and said what if I run with that what if I make it not only the possible but something  nearer the probable Verne was meticulous in his research learning from scientists and studying the scientific reporting of the time his books were filled with Technical details that make him  somewhat laborious to read today, but the audience  of his time ate it up He was the first truly successful science fiction writer Shelley and Poe and a handful of others had dabbled in science fiction But they weren't really science fiction writers though some may  try to deny it all of Jules Verne's most Successful work was science fiction in his first truly smash hit Journey  to the Center of the Earth Verne takes us on a grand adventure  through volcanoes into a Hollow Earth filled with dinosaurs and flashing underground seas But even though the science here  is mostly wrong He launches into it with one of his great loves and one of his great contributions  to science fiction puzzles at the outset the main character finds  an Icelandic manuscript And in it is a set of ancient  mysterious runes in a manic sequence filled with philological Explanations the characters translate the runes to the English alphabet only to find that they are  also in ciphered locked in a room Refusing food or water until  the decipherment is done the protagonists work  to crack the code one character figures out They're looking at a transposition cipher,  but still can't make sense of it, then another character nearly faint from hunger Realizes it's backwards and in Latin Eureka the Location of the passage to the center of the earth is revealed now That is a sci-fi puzzle this tradition of puzzles puzzles of intellect Knowledge or technology  would become rife throughout not only Verne's own work But through him  science fiction at large Verne followed Journey  to the Center of the Earth with from the earth to the moon Because the guy just loved to write about journeys It was pretty much his jam and if you think about science fiction and fantasy from Nova to Lord of the Rings It's something that  so many people picked up on but this story Which is probably known best to us today from the 1902 silent film A Trip to the Moon was a shockingly? realistic depiction of space travel for a time when nobody was even really thinking about rocketry it considered everything from how  a human being might survive the acceleration necessary to escape  the Earth's atmosphere To how Lagrange points work and as Neil Armstrong himself pointed out Verne even figured out that the best place to launch a trip to the moon would be from the coast of Florida And if you want a really wild coincidence Verne named his space gun  the Columbia Decades later and with no intent  of making reference to Verne's work NASA would name their own Space shuttle which served basically  the same purpose the Columbia Verne also gave us 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea which while primarily  remembered for its Single-minded Captain Nemo and its early description  of an electric submarine. It's actually the most radical of the work.  He published during his lifetime 20,000 Leagues offers a bold critique of the society that Verne himself was living in criticizing imperialism and European social structure and giving us  that famous sci-fi trope of the bold adventurer  who retreats to the unknown rather than deal with the politics of society and like Frankenstein 20,000 Leagues makes reference to the classics Which inspired it namely the Odyssey Captain Nemo is even the name Odysseus  uses with the Cyclops helping to cement the link between science fiction and the classics Then there is of course around the world in 80 days Not so science fictiony but it did inspire much of modern steampunk and gave us an excellent mobile game but the reason it's important is that it really ushered in the idea that the world was shrinking that modern transportation and communication allowed different human societies to be explored and intermingle in ways largely absent in the literature before This would become an essential idea to so much of later sci-fi. Oh, and there is one other Verne book I should mention Paris in the 20th century Vern's publisher refused to release it during his lifetime deeming it Too radical in fact the book wasn't published until it was rediscovered in 1994 a hundred and thirty one years after Verne wrote it if you're a Verne fan that one's worth checking out because it shows us the writer Jules Verne could have been it's one of the first novels he ever actually wrote and it's a grim dystopia that warns of some of the social horrors that the Technological marvels he predicted might bring it's one of his most lyrical works, and it's one of in my opinion his most thoughtful plus It's always fun to imagine What would have happened if he'd been allowed to publish this would Verne have combined hard sci-fi with top-tier social critique and created an entirely different direction for the genre We'll never know But join us next time as we talk about the author who really did bring social critique to science fiction on a mass scale H.G. Wells "

Perhaps a billionaire banker or corporate mogul, like Bill Gates or John D. Rockefeller. How about African King Musa Keita I? Ruling the Mali Empire  in the 14th century CE, Mansa Musa, or the King of Kings, amassed a fortune that possibly made him one of the wealthiest  people who ever lived. But his vast wealth was only one piece of his rich legacy. When Mansa Musa came to power in 1312, much of Europe was racked  by famine and civil wars. But many African kingdoms and the Islamic world were flourishing, and Mansa Musa played a great role in bringing the fruits of this flourishing to his own realm. By strategically annexing  the city of Timbuktu, and reestablishing power over the city of Gao, he gained control  over important trade routes between the Mediterranean  and the West African Coast, continuing a period of expansion, which dramatically increased Mali's size. The territory of the Mali Empire was rich in natural resources, such as gold and salt. The world first witnessed the extent of Mansa Musa's wealth in 1324 when he took his pilgrimage to Mecca. Not one to travel on a budget, he brought a caravan stretching as far as the eye could see. Accounts of this journey are mostly based on an oral testimony and differing written records, so it's difficult to determine the exact details. But what most agree on is the extravagant scale of the excursion. Chroniclers describe an entourage  of tens of thousands of soldiers, civilians, and slaves, 500 heralds bearing gold staffs and dressed in fine silks, and many camels and horses bearing an abundance of gold bars. Stopping in cities such as Cairo, Mansa Musa is said to have spent massive quantities of gold, giving to the poor, buying souvenirs, and even having mosques  built along the way. In fact, his spending may have destabilized the regional economy, causing mass inflation. This journey reportedly took over a year, and by the time Mansa Musa returned, tales of his amazing wealth had spread to the ports of the Mediterranean. Mali and its king were elevated to near legendary status, cemented by their inclusion  on the 1375 Catalan Atlas. One of the most important world maps of Medieval Europe, it depicted the King holding a scepter and a gleaming gold nugget. Mansa Musa had literally put his empire and himself on the map. But material riches weren't  the king's only concern. As a devout Muslim, he took a particular interest in Timbuktu, already a center of religion and learning prior to its annexation. Upon returning from his pilgrimage, he had the great  Djinguereber Mosque built there with the help of an Andalusian architect. He also established a major university, further elevating the city's reputation, and attracting scholars and students from all over the Islamic world. Under Mansa Musa, the Empire became urbanized, with schools and mosques in hundreds of densely populated towns. The king's rich legacy  persisted for generations and to this day, there are mausoleums, libraries and mosques that stand as a testament  to this golden age of Mali's history. "

But are you starting to see colors in the rings? If so, your eyes  are playing tricks on you. The disk was only ever black and white. You see, your eyes don't always capture the world as a video camera would. In fact, there are quite a few differences, owing to the anatomy of your eye and the processing that takes place in your brain and its outgrowth, the retina. Let's start with some similarities. Both have lenses to focus light and sensors to capture it, but even those things behave differently. The lens in a camera moves to stay  focused on an object hurtling towards it, while the one in your eye responds by changing shape. Most camera lenses are also achromatic, meaning they focus both red and blue light to the same point. Your eye is different. When red light from an object is in focus, the blue light is out of focus. So why don't things look  partially out of focus all the time? To answer that question, we first need to look at how your eye and the camera capture light: photoreceptors. The light-sensitive surface in a camera only has one kind of photoreceptor that is evenly distributed  throughout the focusing surface. An array of red, green and blue filters on top of these photoreceptors causes them to respond selectively to long, medium and short wavelength light. Your eye's retinas, on the other hand, have several types of photoreceptors, usually three for normal light conditions, and only one type for lowlight, which is why we're color blind  in the dark. In normal light, unlike the camera, we have no need for a color filter because our photoreceptors already respond selectively to different wavelengths of light. Also in contrast to a camera, your photoreceptors  are unevenly distributed, with no receptors for dim light  in the very center. This is why faint stars seem to disappear when you look directly at them. The center also has very few receptors that can detect blue light, which is why you don't notice the blurred blue image from earlier. However, you still perceive blue there because your brain fills it in from context. Also, the edges of our retinas have relatively few receptors for any wavelength light. So our visual acuity and ability to see color falls off rapidly  from the center of our vision. There is also an area in our eyes called the blind spot where there are no photoreceptors of any kind. We don't notice a lack of vision there because once again,  our brain fills in the gaps. In a very real sense, we see with our brains, not our eyes. And because our brains, including the retinas, are so involved in the process, we are susceptible to visual illusions. Here's another illusion caused by the eye itself. Does the center of this image look like it's jittering around? That's because your eye actually jiggles most of the time. If it didn't, your vision  would eventually shut down because the nerves on the retina stop responding to a stationary image of constant intensity. And unlike a camera, you briefly stop seeing whenever you make a larger movement with your eyes. That's why you can't see  your own eyes shift as you look from one to the other in a mirror. Video cameras can  capture details our eyes miss, magnify distant objects and accurately record what they see. But our eyes are remarkably  efficient adaptations, the result of hundreds of millions of years of coevolution with our brains. And so what if we don't always see the world exactly as it is. There's a certain joy to be found watching stationary leaves waving on an illusive breeze, and maybe even an evolutionary advantage. But that's a lesson for another day. "

All wars to some extent are about resources, but this war was like no other conflict in history. To power the vast engine of war, to feed the complex machine that turned out tanks and bombs, trucks and ships, that kept millions of men fed, armed, and clothed in the field, the combatants of World War II needed a diversity and a quantity of natural resources heretofore unconsidered in the annals of military planning. And everybody knew that if they didn't get those resources, it would just be a matter of time before the all-consuming engine of battle ground to a halt. It was this fear that drove the Axis planning throughout much of the war. If we look at the Allies, we see an unimaginable wealth of resources. There were the oil and coal fields of Russia, the vast farmland, minerals, and refineries of the United States, and the far-flung empires of France and Britain, which could draw in exotic resources from across the globe. Now compare that to the Axis, with the small island nation of Japan, and the largely landlocked and noncolonial powers of Germany and Italy. The Allies could fuel the war on resources they already had. If the Axis was going to last at all, they needed to make up for what they lacked in war gains. And this dictated early policy. The Nazis knew that they were gonna lose their supplies of cobalt, copper and, most importantly, oil, as soon as the war began in earnest, for they had imported most of those materials from their soon-to-be enemies. So they needed to find an alternative. The Molotov-Ribbentrop pact with the Soviet Union not only assured that the Germans wouldn't have to fight a two-front war, but also laid out, in great detail, a trade agreement that would have the USSR provide Germany with the supplies of those resources it would need to prosecute the war. Next, the German planners had to tackle their lack of aluminum and iron. And this served as part of the impetus for the invasion of Norway. Not only would Norway serve as an excellent location for aluminum production, but it secured German access to Sweden, which is where the vast bulk of their iron imports came from. But the Germans would also need food if they were going to feed and field an army of millions, and France served as one of the most fertile regions in Europe. With a rapid conquest of France, Germany could also hope to secure strategic reserves that would buy them some time to pin down the other resources they were lacking. And so, there's the first two years of the war. Other concerns certainly factored into the strategic decision-making, but step by step, throughout the early war you can follow the need to shore up the resources the German economy lacked, but even after the massive German expansion of 1940, this left German planners with one great concern: oil. Even after Nazi efforts to support fascists in Romania brought the Romanian oil fields under their control, the German war machine was consuming about 25 percent more oil than even the expanded Reich could produce. Month after month, this shortfall was being made up for by shipments from the USSR, but Nazi planners and the Nazi leadership lived in a state of continual paranoia where the looming and perhaps quite real possibility of Stalin simply cutting off oil shipments would spell an end to the Reich. And this is where the resource war and the terrible ideology of the Third Reich merge. While there were a number of military men who suggested that the fascist war machine should break through North Africa and come to possess the oil fields of the Middle East, Hitler with his need for Lebensraum, his hatred of the Slavs and the Jews, and his foundational fear of communism instead decided that the Nazi armies would move east into the heart of the Soviet Union and to take possession of the Soviet oil fields. When this enormous effort stalled out, there were some desperate attempts to turn south and pick up oil fields closer to the Middle East, but by then it was too late. Germany had used most of its reserves pushing into Russia, and as a result would suffer shortages for the rest of the war. Japan faced a similar dilemma but was perhaps in yet more dire straits because the overwhelming majority of its trade before now had been with one single partner, the United States. Most Japanese planners recognized this deficiency but also believed that any expansion in the Pacific would almost certainly draw them into conflict with the U.S. This led directly to a strategy that involved knocking the U.S. out of the war as quickly as possible, but it also led to two other strategies for the coming conflict, a set of strategies that would divide the Japanese forces. The Army favored what is known as Hokushin-Ron, or the Northern Expansion Doctrine, which called for a push through China into the resource-rich country of Siberia. The central idea was that the army could simultaneously bring the majority of raw materials that their economy needed under Japanese control and cripple the Soviet Union's ability to prosecute a war against Japan. The Navy, on the other hand, advocated Nanshin-Ron or Southern Expansion Doctrine, which proposed sweeping up the islands in the South Pacific to solve Japan's economic shortfalls, and both of these doctrines would play a huge part in how the Japanese prosecuted the war. in the outset of the war, with the invasion of China, we see the beginning of the implementation of the Northern Expansion Doctrine, but though little talked about in the history of World War II, this approach ground to a halt when the Japanese tried to push up through Mongolia and were turned back by the Soviets at the battles of Khalkhyn Gol. Over 100,000 men fought an undeclared war there, and at its end, the Japanese army was forced to abandon its dreams of Siberian conquest, which left their Navy ascendant and free to push the doctrine that would win it the most prestige. And thus began Japan's rapid expansion into the Pacific. The idea was to strip the European nations already beleaguered by the war in the West of all of their colonial possessions in Asia. And this became an utter necessity because, by this point, the United States, Britain, China, and the Dutch government in exile who controlled the all-important Dutch East Indies, had put an embargo on Japan, denying it nearly 80% of its oil. And though this empire was rolled back and finally shattered over the course of the coming years, it does lead me to one last thing I wanted to talk about. You see, as the Japanese expanded in the Pacific, they denied the Allies one key war material: rubber. 90% of the world's rubber production came from the territory overrun by the Japanese. So what did the Allies do? Left with no alternative, they synthesized rubber. At the beginning of the Second World War, only 0.4 percent of America's rubber was synthetic. But by the end, refineries dotted America, and techniques for synthesizing rubber had been established that underpin how we do it to this day and even now, with no war or great international crisis, more of the world's rubber is synthesized than harvested. And this may seem like a small thing, but it tells us something very important about the Second World War. if World War I was the first truly industrial war, the first war where mass production and industrial capacity truly tipped the balance, World War II was the first scientific war, where things like radar, computing, and the atomic bomb would help to decide the world's fate. And not least among these scientific advances were synthetics. Without synthetics, the resource war may have been lost. And while the creation of synthetic forms of many natural resources may not get heralded the way that the radar or the jet engine do, it changed the war and changed the world economy forever. So if you want to understand policy decisions in World War II, whether they be strategic or scientific, one good place to start is to follow the resources. I hope some of these episodes got you thinking in a new way about the Second World War. I know they're not our usual epic story fair, but we wanted to take this opportunity to talk about tactics, ideas, and policies that had a huge impact but sometimes get glossed over in the grand scheme of things. This more or less concludes our discussion of resources in World War II, but as long as we're talking World War II, we wanted to take a closer look at the battle of Britain. So we'll see you soon for that. "
340,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,P27waC05Hdk,"In 1978, Louise Brown became  the world's first baby to be born by in vitro fertilization, or IVF. Her birth revolutionized the field of reproductive medicine. Given that approximately one in eight heterosexual couples has difficulty conceiving, and that homosexual couples and single parents often need clinical help to make a baby, the demand for IVF has been growing. IVF is so common, that more than 5 million babies have been born through this technology. IVF works by mimicking the brilliant design of sexual reproduction. In order to understand IVF, we first need to take a look at the natural process of baby making. Believe it or not, it all starts in the brain. Roughly fifteen days before fertilization can happen, the anterior pituitary gland secretes follicle stimulating hormone, FSH, which ripens a handful of follicles of the ovary that then release estrogen. Each follicle contains one egg, and on average, only one follicle becomes fully mature. As it grows and continues to release estrogen, this hormone not only helps coordinate growth and preparation of the uterus, it also communicates to the brain how well the follicle is developing. When the estrogen level is high enough, the anterior pituitary releases a surge of luteinizing hormone, LH, which triggers ovulation and causes the follicle to rupture and release the egg. Once the egg leaves the ovary, it is directed into the Fallopian tube by the finger-like fimbriae. If the egg is not fertilized by sperm within 24 hours, the unfertilized egg will die, and the entire system will reset itself, preparing to create a new egg and uterine lining the following month. The egg is the largest cell in the body and is protected by a thick,  extracellular shell of sugar and protein called the zona pellucida. The zona thwarts the entry and fusion of more than one sperm, the smallest cell in the body. It takes a man two to three months to make sperm, and the process constantly renews. Each ejaculation during sexual intercourse releases more than 100 million sperm. But only 100 or so will ultimately make it to the proximity of the egg, and only one will successfully penetrate through the armor of the zona pellucida. Upon successful fertilization, the zygote immediately begins  developing into an embryo, and takes about three days to reach the uterus. There, it requires another three or so days to implant firmly into the endometrium, the inner lining of the uterus. Once implanted, the cells that are to become the placenta secrete a hormone that signals to the ovulated follicle that there is a pregnancy in the uterus. This helps rescue that follicle, now called the corpus luteum, from degenerating as it normally would do in that stage of the menstrual cycle. The corpus luteum is responsible for producing the progesterone required to maintain the pregnancy until six to seven weeks of gestation, when the placenta develops and takes over, until the baby is born approximately 40 weeks later. Now, how do you make a baby in a lab? In patients undergoing IVF, FSH is administered at levels that are higher than naturally occuring to cause a controlled overstimulation of the ovaries so that they ultimately  produce multiple eggs. The eggs are then retrieved  just before ovulation would occur, while the woman is under anesthesia, through an aspirating needle that is guided by ultrasound. Most sperm samples are produced by masturbation. In the laboratory, the identified eggs are stripped of surrounding cells and prepared for fertilization  in a petri dish. Fertilization can occur by one of two techniques. In the first, the eggs are incubated with thousands of sperm and fertilization occurs naturally over a few hours. The second technique maximizes certainty of fertilization by using a needle to place a single sperm inside the egg. This is particularly useful when there is a problem with the quality of the sperm. After fertilization, embryos can be further screened for genetic suitability, frozen for later attempted pregnancies, or delivered into the woman's uterus via catheter. Common convention is to transfer the embryo three days after fertilization, when the embryo has eight cells, or on day five, when the embryo is called a blastocyst, and has hundreds of cells. If the woman's eggs are of poor quality due to age or toxic exposures, or have been removed due to cancer, donor eggs may be used. In the case that the intended mother has a problematic uterus, or lacks one, another woman, called the gestational carrier or surrogate, can use her uterus to carry the pregnancy. To increase the odds of success, which are as high as 40% for a woman younger than 35, doctors sometimes transfer multiple embryos at once, which is why IVF results  in twins and triplets more often than natural pregnancies. However, most clinics seek to minimize the chances of multiple pregnancies, as they are riskier for mothers and babies. Millions of babies, like Louise Brown, have been born from IVF and have had normal, healthy lives. The long-term health consequences of ovarian stimulation with IVF medicines are less clear, though so far, IVF seems safe for women. Because of better genetic testing, delayed childbearing, increased accessibility and diminishing cost, it's not inconceivable that artificial baby making via IVF and related techniques could outpace natural reproduction in years to come.

341,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,P9CEzFYCWMo,"In 1963, a 21-year-old physicist  named Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with a rare neuromuscular disorder called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,  or ALS. Gradually, he lost the ability to walk, use his hands, move his face, and even swallow. But throughout it all, he retained his incredible intellect, and in the more than 50 years that followed, Hawking became one of history’s most  accomplished and famous physicists. However, his condition went uncured and he passed away in 2018 at the age of 76. Decades after his diagnosis, ALS still ranks as one of the most complex, mysterious, and devastating  diseases to affect humankind. Also called motor neuron disease  and Lou Gehrig’s Disease, ALS affects about two out of every 100,000 people worldwide. When a person has ALS, their motor neurons, the cells responsible for all voluntary  muscle control in the body, lose function and die. No one knows exactly why or how these cells die and that’s part of what  makes ALS so hard to treat. In about 90% of cases, the disease arises suddenly,  with no apparent cause. The remaining 10% of cases are hereditary, where a mother or father with ALS passes  on a mutated gene to their child. The symptoms typically first appear  after age 40. But in some rare cases, like Hawking’s, ALS starts earlier in life. Hawking’s case was also a medical marvel  because of how long he lived with ALS. After diagnosis, most people with  the disease live between 2 to 5 years before ALS leads to respiratory problems  that usually cause death. What wasn’t unusual in Hawking’s case was that his ability to learn, think, and perceive with his senses  remained intact. Most people with ALS do not experience impaired cognition. With so much at stake  for the 120,000 people who are diagnosed with ALS annually, curing the disease has become one of our most important scientific and medical challenges. Despite the many unknowns, we do have some insight into how ALS  impacts the neuromuscular system. ALS affects two types of nerve cells  called the upper and lower motor neurons. In a healthy body,  the upper motor neurons, which sit in the brain’s cortex, transmit messages from the brain to the lower motor neurons, situated in the spinal cord. Those neurons then transmit the message into muscle fibers, which contract or relax in response, resulting in motion. Every voluntary move we make occurs because of messages transmitted  along this pathway. But when motor neurons degenerate in ALS, their ability to transfer messages is disrupted, and that vital signaling system  is thrown into chaos. Without their regular cues,  the muscles waste away. Precisely what makes the motor neurons degenerate is the prevailing  mystery of ALS. In hereditary cases, parents pass genetic  mutations on to their children. Even then, ALS involves multiple genes with multiple possible impacts on motor neurons, making the precise triggers hard to pinpoint. When ALS arises sporadically, the list of possible causes grows: toxins, viruses, lifestyle, or other environmental factors  may all play roles. And because there are  so many elements involved, there’s currently no single test that can determine whether someone has ALS. Nevertheless, our hypotheses  on the causes are developing. One prevailing idea is that certain proteins inside the motor neurons aren’t folding correctly, and are instead forming clumps. The misfolded proteins and clumps  may spread from cell to cell. This could be clogging up normal cellular processes, like energy and protein production,  which keep cells alive. We’ve also learned that along with  motor neurons and muscle fibers, ALS could involve other cell types. ALS patients typically have inflammation in their brains and spinal cords. Defective immune cells may also play a role in killing motor neurons. And ALS seems to change the behavior of specific cells that provide support for neurons. These factors highlight  the disease’s complexity, but they may also give us a fuller understanding of how it works, opening up new avenues for treatment. And while that may be gradual, we’re making progress all the time. We’re currently developing new drugs, new stem cell therapies  to repair damaged cells, and new gene therapies to slow the advancement of the disease. With our growing arsenal of knowledge, we look forward to discoveries that can change the future for people living with ALS. "
342,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,PBn7iWzrKoI,"What rights do people have, and where do they come from? Who gets to make decisions for others and on what authority? And how can we organize society to meet people's needs? These questions challenged an entire nation during the upheaval of the French Revolution. By the end of the 18th century, Europe had undergone a profound intellectual and cultural shift known as the Enlightenment. Philosophers and artists promoted reason and human freedom over tradition and religion. The rise of a middle class and printed materials encouraged political awareness, and the American Revolution had turned a former English colony into an independent republic. Yet France, one of the largest and richest countries in Europe was still governed by an ancient regime of three rigid social classes called Estates. The monarch King Louis XVI based his authority on divine right and granted special privileges to the First and Second Estates, the Catholic clergy, and the nobles. The Third Estate, middle class merchants and craftsmen, as well as over 20 million peasants, had far less power and they were the only ones who paid taxes, not just to the king, but to the other Estates as well. In bad harvest years, taxation could leave peasants with almost nothing while the king and nobles lived lavishly on their extracted wealth. But as France sank into debt due to its support of the American Revolution and its long-running war with England, change was needed. King Louis appointed finance minister Jacques Necker, who pushed for tax reforms and won public support by openly publishing the government's finances. But the king's advisors strongly opposed these initiatives. Desperate for a solution, the king called a meeting of the Estates-General, an assembly of representatives from the Three Estates, for the first time in 175 years. Although the Third Estate represented 98% of the French population, its vote was equal to each of the other Estates. And unsurprisingly, both of the upper classes favored keeping their privileges. Realizing they couldn't get fair representation, the Third Estate broke off, declared themselves the National Assembly, and pledged to draft a new constitution with or without the other Estates. King Louis ordered the First and Second Estates to meet with the National Assembly, but he also dismissed Necker, his popular finance minister. In response, thousands of outraged Parisians joined with sympathetic soldiers to storm the Bastille prison, a symbol of royal power and a large storehouse of weapons. The Revolution had begun. As rebellion spread throughout the country, the feudal system was abolished. The Assembly's Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen proclaimed a radical idea for the time -- that individual rights and freedoms were fundamental to human nature and government existed only to protect them. Their privileges gone, many nobles fled abroad, begging foreign rulers to invade France and restore order. And while Louis remained as the figurehead of the constitutional monarchy, he feared for his future. In 1791, he tried to flee the country but was caught. The attempted escape shattered people's faith in the king. The royal family was arrested and the king charged with treason. After a trial, the once-revered king was publicly beheaded, signaling the end of one thousand years of monarchy and finalizing the September 21st declaration of the first French republic, governed by the motto ""liberté, égalité, fraternité."" Nine months later, Queen Marie Antoinette, a foreigner long-mocked as ""Madame Déficit"" for her extravagant reputation, was executed as well. But the Revolution would not end there. Some leaders, not content with just changing the government, sought to completely transform French society -- its religion, its street names, even its calendar. As multiple factions formed, the extremist Jacobins lead by Maximilien Robespierre launched a Reign of Terror to suppress the slightest dissent, executing over 20,000 people before the Jacobin's own downfall. Meanwhile, France found itself at war with neighboring monarchs seeking to strangle the Revolution before it spread. Amidst the chaos, a general named Napoleon Bonaparte took charge, becoming Emperor as he claimed to defend the Revolution's democratic values. All in all, the Revolution saw three constitutions and five governments within ten years, followed by decades alternating between monarchy and revolt before the next Republic formed in 1871. And while we celebrate the French Revolution's ideals, we still struggle with many of the same basic questions raised over two centuries ago. "
343,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,PddQvyiBfdc,"Tens of millions of years ago, a force of nature set two giant masses on an unavoidable collision course that would change the face of the Earth and spell life or death  for thousands of species. The force of nature was plate tectonics, and the bodies were North and South America. And even though  they were hurdling towards each other at an underwhelming 2.5 cm per year, their collision actually did have massive biological reprocussions by causing one of the greatest episodes of biological migration in Earth's history: The Great American Biotic Interchange. Our story begins 65 million years ago, the beginning of the age of mammals, when what is now North and South America were continents separated by a marine connection between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. During this time, South America was the home of fauna that included armored glyptodonts as large as compact cars, giant ground sloths weighing more than a ton, opossums, monkeys, and carnivorous terror birds. North America had its own species, such as horses, bears, and saber-toothed cats. Over 20 million years, the shifting of the Farallon and Caribbean Plates produced the Central America Volcanic Arc, a peninsula connected to North America, with only a very narrow seaway separating it from South America. As these plates continued to surf the Earth's magma layer far beneath the Pacific Ocean floor, the Caribbean Plate migrated eastward, and about 15 million years ago, South America finally collided with  this Central American Arc. This gradually closed the water connection between the Pacific and the Caribbean, creating a land bridge, which connected North America  to South America. Terrestrial organisms could now cross between the two continents, and from the fossil records, it's evident that different waves of their dispersals took place. Even though plants don't physically move, they are easily dispersed by wind and waves, so they migrated first, along with a few species of birds. They were followed  by some freshwater fishes and amphibians, and finally, various mammals began to traverse the bridge. From South America, mammals like ground sloths and glyptodonts were widly distributed in North America. Moreover, many South American tropical mammals, like monkeys and bats, colonized the forests of Central America, and are very abundant today. South American predator marsupials went extinct 3 million years ago, at which point North American predators, such as cats, bears and foxes, migrated south and occupied  the ecological space left behind. Horses, llamas, tapirs, cougars, saber-toothed cats, gomphotheres, and later humans also headed south across the land bridge. But what happened on land is only half the story. What had been one giant ocean was now two, creating differences in temperature and salinity for the two bodies of water. The isthmus also became a barrier for many marine organisms, like mollusks, crustaceans, foraminifera, bryozoans, and fish, and separated the populations of many marine species. It also allowed the establishment of the thermohaline circulation, a global water conveyor belt, which transports warm water across the Atlantic, and influences the climate of the East Coast of North America, the West Coast of Europe, and many other areas. It's a challenge to track all of the ways the collision of the Americas changed the world, but it's safe to say that the ripples of the Great American Biotic Interchange have propagated through the history of life on the planet, and that of mankind. What if these species hadn't gone extinct, or if there were no monkeys in Central America, or jaguars in South America? What if the thermohaline circulation wasn't flowing? Would the East Coast of North America be much colder? It all goes to show some of the most impactful transformations of our planet aren't the explosive ones that happen in an instant, but the ones that crawl towards irreversible change. We are the product of history. "
344,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,PgSRAsgrKmg,"Deep beneath the geysers and hot springs  of Yellowstone Caldera lies a magma chamber produced by a  hot spot in the earth’s mantle. As the magma moves towards  the Earth’s surface, it crystallizes to form young, hot igneous rocks. The heat from these rocks drives groundwater towards the surface. As the water cools, ions precipitate out as mineral crystals, including quartz crystals from silicon  and oxygen, feldspar from potassium, aluminum,  silicon, and oxygen, galena from lead and sulfur. Many of these crystals have signature  shapes— take this cascade of pointed quartz,  or this pile of galena cubes. But what causes them to grow into these shapes again and again? Part of the answer lies in their atoms. Every crystal’s atoms are arranged in a highly organized, repeating pattern. This pattern is the defining feature of a crystal, and isn’t restricted to minerals— sand, ice, sugar, chocolate, ceramics,  metals, DNA, and even some liquids have crystalline structures. Each crystalline material’s atomic  arrangement falls into one of six different families: cubic, tetragonal, orthorhombic, monoclinic, triclinic, and hexagonal. Given the appropriate conditions, crystals will grow into geometric shapes that reflect the arrangement of their atoms. Take galena, which has a cubic structure composed of lead and sulfur atoms. The relatively large lead atoms are arranged in a three-dimensional  grid 90 degrees from one another, while the relatively small sulfur atoms  fit neatly between them. As the crystal grows, locations like these attract sulfur atoms, while lead will tend to  bond to these places. Eventually, they will complete the grid  of bonded atoms. This means the 90 degree grid pattern  of galena’s crystalline structure is reflected in the visible  shape of the crystal. Quartz, meanwhile, has a hexagonal  crystalline structure. This means that on one plane its atoms  are arranged in hexagons. In three dimensions, these hexagons are  composed of many interlocking pyramids made up of one silicon atom  and four oxygen atoms. So the signature shape of a quartz  crystal is a six-sided column with pointed tips. Depending on environmental conditions, most crystals have the potential to form multiple geometric shapes. For example, diamonds, which form deep in the Earth’s mantle, have a cubic crystalline structure and can grow into either cubes or octahedrons. Which shape a particular diamond grows into depends on the conditions where it grows, including pressure, temperature,  and chemical environment. While we can’t directly observe growth  conditions in the mantle, laboratory experiments have shown some evidence that diamonds tend to grow into cubes at  lower temperatures and octahedrons at higher temperatures. Trace amounts of water, silicon, germanium, or magnesium might also influence a diamond’s shape. And diamonds never naturally grow into the shapes found in jewelry— those diamonds have been cut to  showcase sparkle and clarity. Environmental conditions can also  influence whether crystals form at all. Glass is made of melted quartz sand, but it isn’t crystalline. That’s because glass cools  relatively quickly, and the atoms do not have time to arrange themselves into the ordered structure of a quartz crystal. Instead, the random arrangement of the atoms in the melted glass is locked in upon cooling. Many crystals don’t form geometric shapes because they grow in extremely close quarters with other crystals. Rocks like granite are full of crystals, but none have recognizable shapes. As magma cools and solidifies, many minerals within it crystallize at the same time and quickly run out of space. And certain crystals, like turquoise, don’t grow into any discernible geometric shape in most environmental conditions, even given adequate space. Every crystal’s atomic structure has  unique properties, and while these properties may not have any bearing on human emotional needs, they do have powerful applications  in materials science and medicine.

How do these beautiful, gelatinous creatures pack such a painful punch? Jellyfish are soft  because they are 95% water and are mostly made of a translucent  gel-like substance called mesoglea. With such delicate bodies, they rely on thousands of venom-containing stinging cells called cnidocytes for protection and prey capture. Even baby jellyfish,  the size of a pencil eraser, have the ability to sting. Larval jellyfish, ephyrae, look like tiny flowers pulsating in the sea. As they grow, they become umbrella-shaped with a bell at the top and descending tentacles  around the margin. The largest species of jellyfish, the lion's mane, has tentacles that can extend  more than 100 feet, longer than a blue whale. These tentacles contain  most of the stinging cells, although some species have them on their bells, too. Venom is ejected via a nematocyst, a whip-like hollow tubule, which lies coiled under  high osmotic pressure. When mechanical or chemical stimuli activate an external trigger, the lid of the cell pops open and sea water rushes in. This forces a microscopic barbed harpoon to shoot out, penetrate and inject venom into its victim. Nematocyst discharge can occur in less than a millionth of a second, making it one of nature's fastest biomechanical processes. Nematocysts can continue to fire even after a jellyfish has died, so it's important to remove lingering tentacles stuck to the skin. Rinsing with vinegar will usually render undischarged nematocysts inactive. Seawater can also help remove residual nematocysts. But don't use fresh water because any change in salt balance alters the osmotic pressure outside of the cnidocyte and will trigger the nematocyst to fire. That's why urinating on the affected area, a common folk remedy, may do more harm that good, depending on the composition of the urine. Most jellyfish stings  are a painful nuisance, but some can be deadly. An Indo-Pacific box jelly, also called a sea wasp, releases venom which can cause contraction of the heart muscles and rapid death in large doses. There's an anti-venom, but the venom is fast-acting, so you'd need immediate  medical intervention. Despite the impressive power in their tentacles, jellies aren't invincible. Their stinging cells are no match for the armor of thick-skin predators, like the leatherback turtle and ocean sunfish. These predators both have adaptations that prevents slippery jellyfish from escaping after they are engulfed: backwards pointing spines in the turtle's mouth and esophagus and recurved teeth behind the sunfish's cheeks. Even tiny lobster slipper larvae can cling to the bell of a jellyfish and hitch a ride, snacking on the jelly while they preserve their own energy for growth. Small agile fish use the jellies as moving reefs for protection, darting between tentacles without ever touching them. Nudibranchs, which are sea slugs covered in protective slime, can actually steal the jelly's defenses by eating the cnidocytes and transferring them  to specialized sacks for later use, as weapons against their own predators. Even humans might benefit from the sting of a jellyfish one day. Scientists are working on manipulating cnidocytes to deliver medicine, with nematocysts rarely 3% of the size of a typical syringe needle. So, the next time you're out in the ocean, be careful. But also, take a second  to marvel at its wonders. "
346,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,PxzNo58pE2c,"More than two kilometers below  the surface of northern Ontario, suspended in 345,000 liters  of ultra-pure water, there’s a perfect sphere. It contains 3600 kilograms  of liquid argon, cooled to -180 degrees Celsius. Scientists continuously monitor  this chamber from above ground, looking for a glimmer  of light in the darkness. Because down here, deep beneath the Earth’s surface  and cocooned in a watery shield, that light would indicate the presence of one of the universe’s greatest mysteries: dark matter. All the matter we can see, planets, stars and galaxies, doesn’t create enough gravitational pull to explain the universe’s larger structure. It’s dark matter, which is estimated to make up 25% of the known universe. But despite its prevalence, so far we haven’t been able  to detect it directly. It’s no small challenge. Dark matter was so named because it doesn’t interact with any type of light, visible or otherwise, which means our usual observation tools simply don’t work when trying to observe it. But while dark matter may not be visible in the electromagnetic spectrum, it’s still matter, so we should be able to measure  its interactions with other matter. And if our current model  of physics is correct, billions of sub-atomic dark matter particles are passing through  the Earth every second. Despite the prevalence of dark matter, its interactions are predicted to be rare  and extremely weak. To detect these interactions, dark matter experiments need to be incredibly sensitive. With such sensitive equipment, the ever-present background radiation  on Earth’s surface would create so much noise in the data that any dark matter particles would be completely overwhelmed. It would be like trying to hear a pin drop on a busy city street. To solve this problem, scientists have had to dig deep into the Earth. Dark matter experiments are set up in specialized underground labs, either in mines or inside mountains. The rock that makes up  the Earth’s crust works like a filter, absorbing radiation  and stopping disruptive particles. The ultra-pure water in which the detector is suspended adds an additional layer of radiation filtering. This shielding ensures that only the particles scientists are looking for can make their way into the detectors. Once these particles reach  an experiment’s inner vessel, scientists have a chance  of detecting them. The detector media are chosen because  they’re exquisitely sensitive detectors that can be purified extremely well. These could be a liquid noble gas, germanium and silicon crystals, a refrigerant, or other materials. When radiation interacts,  it leaves tell-tale signs, such as light or bubbles, which can be picked up by the sensors inside the detector. The detector media are held  in a central chamber made of glass or a special type of acrylic. These chambers have to be able to hold the substance inside without interacting with it while withstanding incredible pressure  from the water outside. The inner vessel is surrounded  by powerful sensors designed to detect even the tiniest blips of light, or the sound vibrations  caused by a single bubble. Each sensor records data 24/7, and experiments run for months and years at a time, generating terabytes of data every day. Building dark matter detectors  is as much a feat of engineering as it is a feat of physics. By the time an experiment is ready to start collecting data, years or decades of work and investment have already gone into it, to the tune of tens  of millions of dollars. As of 2017, no dark matter particles  have been directly detected. That’s not entirely surprising. Physicists expect these interactions to be incredibly rare and difficult to detect. In the meantime, scientists continue to develop new technologies and increase detector sensitivity, closing in on where dark matter is hiding. And when they find it, we’ll finally be able to bring the  universe’s darkest secrets into the light. "
347,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,R7WPEYGr1Vs,"On a December afternoon in Chicago during the middle of World War II, scientists cracked open the nucleus at the center of the uranium atom and turned nuclear mass into energy over and over again. They did this by creating  for the first time a chain reaction inside a new engineering marvel: the nuclear reactor. Since then, the ability to mine great amounts of energy from uranium nuclei has led some to bill nuclear power as a plentiful utopian source of electricity. A modern nuclear reactor generates enough electricity from one kilogram of fuel to power an average American household for nearly 34 years. But rather than dominate the global electricity market, nuclear power has declined from an all-time high of 18% in 1996 to 11% today. And it's expected to drop further in the coming decades. What happened to the great promise of this technology? It turns out nuclear power  faces many hurdles, including high construction costs and public opposition. And behind these problems lie  a series of unique engineering challenges. Nuclear power relies on the fission of uranium nuclei and a controlled chain reaction that reproduces this splitting in many more nuclei. The atomic nucleus is densely packed with protons and neutrons bound by a powerful nuclear force. Most uranium atoms have a total of 238 protons and neutrons, but roughly one in every 140 lacks three neutrons, and this lighter isotope is less tightly bound. Compared to its more abundant cousin, a strike by a neutron easily splits the U-235 nuclei into lighter, radioactive elements called fission products, in addition to two to three neutrons, gamma rays, and a few neutrinos. During fission, some nuclear mass transforms into energy. A fraction of the newfound energy powers the fast-moving neutrons, and if some of them strike uranium nuclei, fission results in a second larger generation of neutrons. If this second generation of neutrons strike more uranium nuclei, more fission results in an even larger third generation, and so on. But inside a nuclear reactor, this spiraling chain reaction is tamed using control rods made of elements that capture excess  neutrons and keep their number in check. With a controlled chain reaction, a reactor draws power steadily and stably for years. The neutron-led chain reaction is a potent process driving nuclear power, but there's a catch that can result in unique demands  on the production of its fuel. It turns out, most of the neutrons emitted from fission have too much kinetic energy to be captured by uranium nuclei. The fission rate is too low and the chain reaction fizzles out. The first nuclear reactor built in Chicago used graphite as a moderator to scatter and slow down  neutrons just enough to increase their capture by uranium and raise the rate of fission. Modern reactors commonly use purified water as a moderator, but the scattered neutrons are still a little too fast. To compensate and keep up the chain reaction, the concentration of U-235 is enriched to four to seven times  its natural abundance. Today, enrichment is often done by passing a gaseous uranium compound through centrifuges to separate lighter U-235  from heavier U-238. But the same process can be continued to highly enrich U-235 up to 130 times its natural abundance and create an explosive chain reaction in a bomb. Methods like centrifuge processing must be carefully regulated to limit the spread of bomb-grade fuel. Remember, only a fraction of the released fission energy goes into speeding up neutrons. Most of the nuclear power goes into the kinetic energy of the fission products. Those are captured inside the reactor as heat by a coolant, usually purified water. This heat is eventually used to drive an electric turbine generator by steam just outside the reactor. Water flow is critical  not only to create electricity, but also to guard against the most dreaded type of reactor accident, the meltdown. If water flow stops because a pipe carrying it breaks, or the pumps that push it fail, the uranium heats up very quickly and melts. During a nuclear meltdown, radioactive vapors escape  into the reactor, and if the reactor fails to hold them, a steel and concrete containment building is the last line of defense. But if the radioactive gas pressure is too high, containment fails and the gasses escape into the air, spreading as far and wide as the wind blows. The radioactive fission products in these vapors eventually decay into stable elements. While some decay in a few seconds, others take hundreds  of thousands of years. The greatest challenge for a nuclear reactor is to safely contain these products and keep them from harming humans or the environment. Containment doesn't stop mattering once the fuel is used up. In fact, it becomes an even greater storage problem. Every one to two years, some spent fuel is removed from reactors and stored in pools of water that cool the waste and block its radioactive emissions. The irradiated fuel is a mix of uranium that failed to fission, fission products, and plutonium, a radioactive material not found in nature. This mix must be isolated from the environment until it has all safely decayed. Many countries propose deep time storage in tunnels drilled far underground, but none have been built, and there's great uncertainty about their long-term security. How can a nation that has existed for only a few hundred years plan to guard plutonium through its radioactive half-life of 24,000 years? Today, many nuclear power plants sit on their waste, instead, storing them indefinitely on site. Apart from radioactivity, there's an even greater danger with spent fuel. Plutonium can sustain a chain reaction and can be mined from the waste to make bombs. Storing spent fuel is thus not only a safety risk for the environment, but also a security risk for nations. Who should be the watchmen to guard it? Visionary scientists from the early years of the nuclear age pioneered how to reliably tap  the tremendous amount of energy inside an atom - as an explosive bomb and as a controlled power source with incredible potential. But their successors have learned humbling insights about the technology's not-so-utopian industrial limits. Mining the subatomic realm makes for complex, expensive, and risky engineering. "

Without him, it's unlikely that we would have charged away from the space westerns... ...and gadget adventures of the pulp era, and raced towards what he himself coined ""Social Science Fiction"". Asimov laid the foundation for our understanding  of robots, and space empires. He led science fiction away from simply marveling at the new technology of the Atomic Age, instead, forcing us to question HOW we use it, and what it means for us as a species. He made science fiction something that asked you to think... ...rather than leaving it to simply serve as a distraction from everyday life Without him, we wouldn't have modern science fiction. But it almost didn't happen. *Extra Sci Fi Theme* Revolution sweeps Russia. In the midst of the chaos of civil war, a child is born, a child who will be someday known as Isaac Asimov. But the chaos of revolution was no place for a child... ...especially not one from a Jewish family, his parents decided. So they got out  while they could. By the time the child was three,  they had moved to America, to New York. A precocious child, Asimov learned  to read at the age of five... ...and, because of the nearly universal lack of records from the Russian Civil War... ...his mother got him into school early by telling them he was born a year earlier than he was. Maybe. Maybe, it was just a month earlier  than he was actually born. You see, this child, Isaac Asimov, one of the first major writers to really explore the butterfly effect... ...would have his own life, and thus so many of our lives, forever altered by this one small fact: There was no record  of his date of birth. No one, not even his own parents, knew for certain when he was born. It was somewhere between early October, 1919, and the beginning of January, 1920. And when young Asimov learned that his mother had fibbed to get him into school... ...he insisted that the school change the records to give him his ""real"" birthday. And for his ""real"" birthday, he chose to be  the youngest he might have been... ...choosing a birthday of January 2nd, 1920... ...a decision that will have unforeseen consequences. But those consequences are years away. As he grew up, his parents ran a candy store where he worked frequently. And there, fortunately for all of us,  they sold magazines. Not just any magazines, mind you, Science Fiction magazines, which young Isaac... ...poured over in all of his free time. When it came time for college, Asimov knew he wanted to go into the sciences, so he enrolled to be a zoologist. But he soon found  he disliked dissecting cats... ...and so became a Chemistry major instead. And as he was plugging away  at his college degree... ...one day he decided to take a trip down to the offices of Astounding Stories... ...where he met one John W. Campbell. They sat and talked for an hour... ...by the end of which, Campbell had promised to take a look at one of Asimov's stories. This he did, and rejected it. But this did lead to regular meetings between the two... ...and time and again, Asimov submitted writing, until at last, he got one accepted. Finally, with a story called ""Marooned off Vesta"", he became a published author. Though, amusingly, not by Campbell... ...but by his rival publication, ""Amazing Stories"". After that, encouraged by Campbell, he wrote fervently, and began being published everywhere... ...including his favorite magazine: Campbell's own, ""Astounding Stories"". By now, he had graduated, and was busy  getting rejected by medical schools. With medicine not seeming to be in the cards,  he had to choose another path. As he was mulling over getting his Masters in chemistry, his old friend Campbell read him an him an Emmerson quote. It said: ""If the stars should appear  one night in a thousand years... ...how would men believe, and adore, and persevere for generations, the remembrance of the city of God?"" After reading the passage, Campbell exclaimed that he thought instead... ...the stars appearing once in a thousand years would drive people mad... ...and then asked Asimov  to write a story about THAT. Campbell offered Asimov double pay, and Asimov set off to write the story that Campbell always knew he could. He wrote Nightfall. This instantly propelled him into the first rank of science fiction writers. While demand for his stories grew, and letters from fans started pouring in... ...science fiction writing still wasn't making ends meet. He wanted to get married, and was looking for something more stable... ...and with America entering the Second World War... ...he decided to put away writing, and start a real career down at the Philadelphia Naval Yard. For a year, he didn't write. But lucky for all of us, during the war, a lot of people with a bent for science on the East Coast ended up at the Philadelphia Naval Yards. So two of his coworkers and close friends ended up being L. Sprague de Camp and the man who helped get him the job: Robert Heinlein, and they wouldn't let him just give up in the things he loved. And so again, he picked up the pen. But once more, a twist of fate pulled him away. In 1945, he was drafted. He shouldn't have been,  but he was. Remember when, as a child, his mother had claimed he was older than he was to get into school... ...and then later, he rebelled and insisted on saying his official birthdate was the one that made him seem as young as possible? Well, that instance put him just below the oldest legal draft age of 26... ...and so, he was shipped off to Hawai'i. But, in one of the strangest twists of fate in sci-fi history... ...nine months later, a clerical error gave him an honorable discharge... ...and he was back on the east coast, and throwing himself back at writing. It's this period that gave us  some of his greatest works... ...and while he'll go on to get a doctorate and serve as a professor before deciding to become a professional writer full time... ...it's this period we're going to talk about for the next two episodes... ...because Asimov's great gift to sci-fi, was his ability to take theories or cutting edge scientific ideas... ...and ask, ""What would humanity do with this?"" ...and, ""How would this really play out?"" Due to his life of peculiar experiences, Asimov saw technology not as gadgets and gizmos in isolation... ...but rather as a part of the march of human progress. He saw that, you couldn't look at technology without looking at what it would mean to society... ...and how we would use it as human beings. Now his failing, as later writers would point out... ...is that he didn't realize that human nature, along with the foundation of societies, can change. Many of his books and many of his characters came out of the culture of a post World War 2 America... ...with it's perspectives, values, and biases. And even when he was commenting on, or critiquing those values, sometimes he couldn't shake those biases. He also -- and here I am committing a great blasphemy in the science fiction world by saying this -- wasn't... ...a great writer... in the technical sense. His prose are utilitarian, and his characters are often histrionic... ...serving less as characters, and more as devices to propel the plot. But his ideas, his ideas were revolutionary. He was the first great ideas writer of modern Sci Fi, and perhaps the best. Every book played with some theme or concept, exploring some notion that would impact our thinking for generations. At times, this makes his books hard to read today... ...because his ideas have become so much a part of of our society... ...that the revelations in them, which must have been mind-blowing when they were first released... ...are hard not to have spoiled by their mere act of existing in the modern world. Robotics, AI, Economics, Political Theory... ...all of these bare the stamp of his incredible mind. And, he was one of the most prolific writers of the modern age... ...leaving behind roughly 500 books, ranging from mystery novels, to books on hard science... ...to folios of dirty limericks. But it's the two greatest pillars of his idea-centric science fiction we'll be focusing on for the next few weeks: Robotics... ...and The Foundation. We'll see you then! *Exiting Theme* "

Dr. Welch and his team are pulling  into a train station in Washington DC returning, from a grueling cross-country  inspection of military hospitals. They hope to make their report and get some rest. Instead, a soldier meets them on the platform with new orders. Proceed immediately to Deven's. Spanish Influenza has struck the camp. [Opening theme] Eight hours later, Welch and his team  arrive in Massachusetts. They find Camp Deven's paralyzed. Patients fill each inch  of hospital space turning blue and coughing so hard they tear  their abdominal muscles They hemorrhage blood from their noses  and scream in fever delirium. In extreme cases, the disease has ripped  tiny holes in their lungs oxygen leaks out collecting beneath  the victims skin so they crackle when nurses roll them over like the pop snap sound of rice-cereal. What is happening? All training has stopped. Recruits that aren't sick have been put  into service caring for those that are. Nearly half the camp's  medical staff is ill. Some didn't even  show symptoms, they just collapsed. These sudden onset patients  often die within 12 hours. Those that avoid that quick death are falling to secondary pneumonia infections. The Army has arranged special trains to take away the dead and it's already  showing up in Boston. After a marathon session  of autopsies revealing lungs  full of frothy blood, the team turns  to Welch. He's the head of the  American Medical Association and has studied rare diseases  on three continents. Shaken, Welch says, ""This must be some kind of new infection or plague."" Then he runs out of the room, stepping around sick men  to get to a phone. He calls his boss Army Surgeon General Gorgas. ""This is going to spread."" He says, ""The army needs to shut down troop movements and expand hospital space now."" Then he calls the Rockefeller Institute and orders Dr. Oswald Avery to report to Devon's. Avery is a peculiar man. Like Welch, he'd shown  no interest in marriage or family. But, unlike Welch who that private clubs  and vacation in Atlantic City, Avery had no hobbies or social life. He is a single-minded obsessive, who lives in an apartment next to the Institute and talks  only about his work. If anybody could find the pathogen responsible, Avery could. ... but they have so little time. Several things  need to happen, Welch reasons. They need to figure out how the disease spreads and how to kill it. ... and whether they could do anything to stop it. They need to identify  the pathogen, the bacteria or toxin that caused this disease, so they could develop a serum, antitoxin, or vaccine. And that was Avery's task. Avery who had done such good work on the pneumonia serum they tested in the summer, which might come in handy given all the secondary  pneumonia cases. But Welch and his team weren't the only ones hunting for the pathogen. Long Island, New York. The speading Board of Health Car  fishtails down the dirt road. Inside it sits the most unusual pair  in American medicine. In the passenger seat hanging on for dear life is Dr. William Park. Behind the wheel, with her foot firmly on the accelerator, is the labs assistant director, Dr. Anna Williams. The two seem almost polar opposites. Where Park is religious, William stouts. He's a gentleman born to high society, where she prefers driving fast cars and riding shotgun on stunt planes. But in 25 years of collaboration, they've won fame for their work  on polio rabies and diphtheria. ... which is why they're speeding  towards an army base. If American doctors hope to produce a vaccine or Serum to fight this new disease, They need Park and Williams. No one, not even  their rivals at Rockefeller, can produce vaccine in the quantities Park can. If they isolate the pathogen, he can inject it into a horse, then draw the blood and extract the equine antibodies. and Park has a lot of horses. It's how they made enough diphtheria antitoxin to supply every doctor in New York free of charge. They parked the car, tie on their masks, and get to work. Within hours, they're heading  back to the city, the back seats stuffed full of throat swabs, blood samples,  and lung tissue Both teams are looking for the same thing: Bacillus influenzae 16 years earlier, the German physician Richard Pfeiffer had identified it as the cause of influenza - a discovery so momentous that the microbe  was nicknamed ""Pfeiffer's bacillus."" But Pfeiffer's is difficult  to identify and isolate. A tiny error in preparation  can ruin the sample, so finding it takes time. Meanwhile, army epidemiologists  are tracking the spread of the disease. They could actually  chart it on a map, jumping from base to base along shipping routes and rail lines. Boston. Philadelphia. New York. New Orleans. Puget Sound. The Great Lakes. Sometimes, men became so sick in transit that they had to be carried off the ships and trains when they reached their destinations. Their initial investigation suggests it's severe influenza. That means it's airborne and can survive for hours on hard surfaces. The large number  of secondary infections indicate that it suppresses  the immune system. Surgeon General Gorgas tries to raise the alarm. He insists his superiors freeze all transfers and stop the troop ships. At the very least, they could hold the men in quarantine for a week before they board. The military refuses. Germany is on their last legs,  they argue. The Austrians and the Ottomans are rumored to be drafting peace offers. This is not the time to let up the pressure. Nothing must distract them  or the public from the war effort. They send out  the next draft registration, forcing thousands of men across the country to crowd into civic buildings to fill out paperwork. Gorgas protests. What is the point of this? The camps have stopped all training to deal with the outbreak. These new draftees  wouldn't become fighting men, they'd just report  for duty and get flu. Finally, a win. The army agrees and cancels the next draft. But it's too late. As Gorgas battles the generals, unit commanders are already  ignoring medical advice. At Camp Grant, a doctor sits  in the Commandant's office telling his commander that the overcrowding situation is dangerous. He's ignoring regulations - too many men in the barracks  and on transfer trains. The Commandant answer will seal his fate. In two weeks, the doctor  will be back in this office, telling him that 500 men are dead. The last troop train they'd sent had turned into a plague train. 1/4 of the transfers  had to be hospitalized, and the camp  had run out of coffins. Upon hearing this the Commandant, will order  the doctor out of his office... ... draw his pistol... ... and take his own life. But that is two weeks from now. At this moment, he says the overcrowding is necessary. This is war doctor But as bad as things  are in the military, they're worse on the civilian front. The head of the Public Health Service is in denial. He issues a useless notice on how to avoid influenza and collects some statistics,  but does nothing more. The military worries that raising public awareness of the flu will damage morale, and he's not a man to stand up  to the military. And he's not alone. In Boston, New York,  and Philadelphia, people are starting to collapse on  the street or fall from horseback. Hacking, shivering patients fill hospitals. Employee absenteeism hikes up but civic leaders refuse  to admit the growing crisis As Park and Williams raced  to identify the Pathogen, with half their staff ill and some dying, the head of the New York Board of Health, a homeopath with the no scientific training... ... denies there's an epidemic. In Philadelphia, the mayor and his health officials are telling the press that the outbreak is nearly over. They continue doing so day after day as the death toll mounts  and hospital wards fill. The press buries flu reports in the back pages  to preserve wartime morale. After all, panicked citizens don't show up  for work at the shipyard They don't visit  their neighborhood Marine recruiter, or buy liberty loans to fund the war effort. And that last one is important, because Philadelphia is about to throw the largest Liberty Loan drive in the country. Soon, thousands will march through the city and hundreds of thousands will turn up to watch and chip in. Doctors urge the mayor to cancel  all public gatherings. he refuses He refuses. September 27th. There's been progress. Welch and his team at Camp Deven's telephone their report to Gorgas. They found Pfeiffer's bacillus in a majority of the flu cases. Park and Williams confirm the findings in their samples. Now if they can isolate and grow a sample of Pfeiffer's, They can begin  work on a vaccine. But Avery isn't so sure. He'd found Pfeiffer's,  but not consistently. In fact, he wonders  if something else is responsible: a virus too small to see. If so, they could only hope that when they produce the vaccine, the horse would make antibodies for this virus as well. It was the best they could do. After making his report, Welch boards a train to DC. It had been  a period of exhausting, dangerous work. He feels bone tired, and has a headache. The symptoms start to show on the train ride. He switches his ticket and gets a room at his favorite hotel in Atlantic City. He'll remain there, delirious, in self-imposed quarantine for weeks. The most respected man in American medicine is out of action, right when the country  needs him most. Because America was about to run out of coffins [Ending theme] "
350,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Rh9vBczqMk0,"How does this music make you feel? Do you find it beautiful? Is it creative? Now, would you change your answers if you learned  the composer was this robot? Believe it or not, people have been grappling with the question of artificial creativity, alongside the question of artifcial intelligence, for over 170 years. In 1843, Lady Ada Lovelace, an English mathematician considered the world's first computer programmer, wrote that a machine could not have human-like intelligence as long as it only did what humans intentionally programmed it to do. According to Lovelace, a machine must be able  to create original ideas if it is to be considered intelligent. The Lovelace Test, formalized in 2001, proposes a way of scrutinizing this idea. A machine can pass this test if it can produce an outcome that its designers cannot explain based on their original code. The Lovelace Test is, by design, more of a thought experiment than an objective scientific test. But it's a place to start. At first glance, the idea of a machine creating high quality, original music in this way might seem impossible. We could come up with an extremely complex algorithm using random number generators, chaotic functions, and fuzzy logic to generate a sequence of musical notes in a way that would be impossible to track. But although this would yield countless original melodies never heard before, only a tiny fraction of them would be worth listening to. With the computer having no way to distinguish between those which we would consider beautiful and those which we won't. But what if we took a step back and tried to model a natural process that allows creativity to form? We happen to know of at least one such process that has lead to original, valuable, and even beautiful outcomes: the process of evolution. And evolutionary algorithms, or genetic algorithms that mimic biological evolution, are one promising approach to making machines generate original and valuable artistic outcomes. So how can evolution make  a machine musically creative? Well, instead of organisms, we can start with an initial population of musical phrases, and a basic algorithm that mimics reproduction and random mutations by switching some parts, combining others, and replacing random notes. Now that we have  a new generation of phrases, we can apply selection using  an operation called a fitness function. Just as biological fitness is determined by external environmental pressures, our fitness function can be determined by an external melody chosen by human musicians, or music fans, to represent the ultimate beautiful melody. The algorithm can then compare between our musical phrases and that beautiful melody, and select only the phrases that are most similar to it. Once the least similar sequences are weeded out, the algorithm can reapply mutation and recombination to what's left, select the most similar, or fitted ones, again from the new generation, and repeat for many generations. The process that got us there has so much randomness and complexity built in that the result might pass the Lovelace Test. More importantly, thanks to the presence of human aesthetic in the process, we'll theoretically generate melodies we would consider beautiful. But does this satisfy our intuition for what is truly creative? Is it enough to make something original and beautiful, or does creativity require intention and awareness of what is being created? Perhaps the creativity in this case is really coming from the programmers, even if they don't understand the process. What is human creativity, anyways? Is it something more than a system of interconnected neurons developed by biological  algorithmic processes and the random experiences that shape our lives? Order and chaos, machine and human. These are the dynamos at the heart of machine creativity initiatives that are currently making music,  sculptures, paintings, poetry and more. The jury may still be out as to whether it's fair to call these acts of creation creative. But if a piece of art can make you weep, or blow your mind, or send shivers down your spine, does it really matter who or what created it? "
351,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,RhaepLsP5eg,"It was the perfect wedding,  the guests thought. The groom was Orpheus, the greatest of all poets and musicians. The bride Eurydice, a wood nymph. Anyone could tell the couple  was truly and deeply in love. Suddenly, Eurydice stumbled,  then fell to the ground. By the time Orpheus reached her side, she was dead, and the snake that had bitten  her was slithering away through the grass. Following Eurydice’s funeral, Orpheus was overcome with a grief the human world could not contain, and so he decided he would journey to the land of the dead, a place from which no living creature had ever returned, to rescue his beloved. When Orpheus reached the gates of the underworld, he began to strum his lyre. The music was so beautiful that Cerberus, the three-headed dog who guards the dead, lay down as Orpheus passed. Charon, the ferry captain who charged  dead souls to cross the River Styx, was so moved by the music that he brought  Orpheus across free of charge. When Orpheus entered  the palace of Hades and Persephone, the king and queen of the dead, he began to sing. He sang of his love for Eurydice,  and said she had been taken away too soon. The day would come when she,  like all living creatures, dwelled in the land of the dead for all eternity, so couldn’t Hades grant her just a few more years on Earth? In the moment after Orpheus finished, all hell stood still. Sisyphus no longer rolled his rock up the hill. Tantalus did not reach for the water  he would never be allowed to drink. Even the Furies,  the demonic goddesses of vengeance, wept. Hades and Persephone granted Orpheus’s plea, but on one condition. As he climbed back out of the underworld, he must not turn around to see if Eurydice was following behind him. If he did, she would return to the land of the dead forever. Orpheus began to climb. With each step, he worried more and more  about whether Eurydice was behind him. He heard nothing— where were her footsteps? Finally, just before he stepped out of the underworld and into the bright light of day, he gave into temptation. Orpheus tried to return to the underworld, but was refused entry. Separated from Eurydice, Orpheus swore never to love another woman again. Instead, he sat in a grove of trees  and sang songs of lovers. There was Ganymede, the beautiful boy  who Zeus made drink-bearer to the gods. There was Myrrah, who loved her father  and was punished for it, and Pygmalion, who sculpted  his ideal woman out of ivory, then prayed to Venus until she came to life. And there was Venus herself, whose beautiful Adonis was killed by a wild boar. It was as if Orpheus’s own love and loss had allowed him to see into  the hearts of gods and people everywhere. For some, however, poetry was not enough. A group of wild women called the Maenads could not bear the thought that a poet who sang so beautifully of love would not love them. Their jealousy drove them to a frenzy  and they destroyed poor Orpheus. The birds, nature’s singers,  mourned Orpheus, as did the rivers, who made music as they babbled. The world had lost two great souls. Orpheus and Eurydice had loved each other so deeply that when they were separated, Orpheus had understood the pain and joys of lovers everywhere, and a new art form, the love poem, was born. While the world wept, Orpheus found peace, and his other half, in the underworld. There, to this day, he walks with Eurydice along the banks of the River Styx. Sometimes, they stroll side by side; sometimes, she is in front; and sometimes, he takes the lead, turning to look back at her as often as he likes. "
352,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,RnvCbquYeIM,"Every year, the world uses  35 billion barrels of oil. This massive scale of fossil fuel  dependence pollutes the Earth and it won't last forever. Scientists estimate that we've consumed about 40% of the world's oil. According to present estimates, at this rate, we'll run out of oil and gas in 50 years or so, and in about a century for coal. On the flip side, we have abundant sun, water, and wind. These are renewable energy sources, meaning that we won't use them up over time. What if we could exchange our fossil fuel dependence for an existence based  solely on renewables? We've pondered that question for decades, and yet, renewable energy still only provides about 13% of our needs. That's because reaching 100% requires renewable energy that's inexpensive and accessible. This represents a huge challenge, even if we ignore the politics involved and focus on the science and engineering. We can better understand the problem by understanding how we use energy. Global energy use is a diverse and complex system, and the different elements  require their own solutions. But for now, we'll focus on two of the most familiar in everyday life: electricity and liquid fuels. Electricity powers blast furnaces, elevators, computers, and all manner of things in homes, businesses, and manufacturing. Meanwhile, liquid fuels  play a crucial role in almost all forms of transportation. Let's consider the electrical portion first. The great news is that our technology is already advanced enough to capture all that energy  from renewables, and there's an ample supply. The sun continuously radiates about 173 quadrillion watts of solar energy at the Earth, which is almost 10,000 times our present needs. It's been estimated that a surface that spans several hundred thousand kilometers would be needed to power humanity at our present usage levels. So why don't we build that? Because there are other  hurdles in the way, like efficiency and energy transportation. To maximize efficiency, solar plants must be located in areas  with lots of sunshine year round, like deserts. But those are far away  from densely populated regions where energy demand is high. There are other forms of renewable energy we could draw from, such as hydroelectric, geothermal, and biomasses, but they also have limits based on availability and location. In principle, a connected electrical energy network with power lines crisscrossing the globe would enable us to transport power from where it's generated to where it's needed. But building a system on this scale faces an astronomical price tag. We could lower the cost by developing advanced technologies to capture energy more efficiently. The infrastructure for transporting energy would also have to change drastically. Present-day power lines lose about 6-8% of the energy they carry because wire material dissipates energy through resistance. Longer power lines would mean more energy loss. Superconductors could be one solution. Such materials can transport electricity without dissipation. Unfortunately, they only work if cooled to low temperatures, which requires energy  and defeats the purpose. To benefit from that technology, we'd need to discover new superconducting materials that operate at room temperature. And what about the all-important, oil-derived liquid fuels? The scientific challenge there is to store renewable energy in an easily transportable form. Recently, we've gotten better at producing lithium ion batteries, which are lightweight and have high-energy density. But even the best of these store about 2.5 megajoules per kilogram. That's about 20 times less than the energy in one kilogram of gasoline. To be truly competitive, car batteries would have to store much more energy without adding cost. The challenges only increase for bigger vessels, like ships and planes. To power a cross-Atlantic flight for a jet, we'd need a battery weighing about 1,000 tons. This, too, demands a technological leap towards new materials, higher energy density, and better storage. One promising solution would be to find efficient ways to convert solar into chemical energy. This is already happening in labs, but the efficiency is still too low to allow it to reach the market. To find novel solutions, we'll need lots of creativity, innovation, and powerful incentives. The transition towards all-renewable  energies is a complex problem involving technology,  economics, and politics. Priorities on how to tackle this challenge depend on the specific assumptions we have to make when trying to solve such a multifaceted problem. But there's ample reason to be optimistic that we'll get there. Top scientific minds around the world are working on these problems and making breakthroughs all the time. And many governments and businesses are investing in technologies that harness the energy all around us. "
353,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,RwXAGiIVsgQ,"(intro) As the great empires battled in the scorched plains of the Middle East, a new threat began to creep its way onto the scene. It was, at first, a small thing, a local thing. A man in Pelusium dies. But this death served merely as the starting bell, the catalyst for a time of chaos and dread. A darkness reached out from the borders of Egypt and unleashed a horror never before seen on the world. That man in Pelusium had, at first, felt only a fever. But then, a strange fog descended on his mind. accompanied by a swelling of great black pustules on his thigh. Then, he began to vomit blood and his skin began to decay while he still lived. He had the plague. This outbreak in Pelusium is the first recorded instance in world history of the plague. But still, Pelusium was a somewhat isolated place. Sure, rumors began to spread across the empire of a town transformed into a living hell, but, at first, they were only rumors, horror stories to share at night. But then the plague moved up to Alexandria, the jewel of Egypt, and that horror became very real. The great port city of Alexandria fell into chaos. No medicine or prayer could stop the ravages of the disease. People spoke of the ends times, of the wrath of God, and people died. Unfortunately, Alexandria was one of the great ports of the ancient world. It was a center of trade. It provided grain to the greatest cities of eastern Rome. And so, from there, from port to port, the great plague made its way across the Roman world. In 542, it reached Constantinople. The horrors it inflicted cannot be overstated. One in four people in the great city died. Like, imagine that. Imagine if one out of every four people you knew just vanished. Imagine what it does to an economy. To the functions of trade and of state. How does a world run when, suddenly, for no rhyme or reason, a fourth of its people are snatched up by the jaws of death? And those left alive had other, grimmer duties? Those struck with the plague didn't die in ways that were uniform. They fell victim to different symptoms. Sometimes suffering delirium, sometimes falling into a catatonic state. Some men felt such great thirst, that they would run outside, wild, and drink from the fountains until they died, their bodies half-in and half-out of the water. Those who slipped into a coma-like state wouldn't die immediately. Not if they had somebody to tend to them. They would eat and drink if nourishment was put to their lips, which meant many of their loved ones lived with the spectre of death, caring for those they loved as the buboes grew and burst. And those who fell into a coma without somebody to care for them: They starved to death without even knowing. Bodies sealed in houses with no one to discover them until the stench became too great. It was said that no man was seen on the streets unless he was carrying a corpse. Justinian had set up an office to handle the burials when the plague first struck, but no functionary, no office of state could keep up with the tide of death. First, they filled the cemeteries, then, they dug up all the open land in Constantinople to bury the dead. Then, in the state's final days of dwindling functionality, they had dug mass graves outside the walls. But soon, these, too, were filled. Gravediggers tried to press the bodies down and pack them in. As everything unraveled, people just began to dump the bodies into the sea, which only lead to bloated corpses washing up along the shore. They also tried filling boats with corpses and pushing those out into the waves. All along the Mediterranean world, ghostly ships, manned only by the dead, would find their way to the coastline, bringing a cargo of bodies riddled by the plague. Finally, the people of Constantinople took to simply packing the corpses into the guard towers that lined its great wall. When the wind blew, the stench of decay covered the city. The queen of cities was a ghost town. Those the plague didn't kill, it often drove mad with horror or grief. Suicides increased dramatically and all over the world, reports spread of grim apparitions, plying the water in brazen boats or spreading the plague by a touch of their ghostly hand. Whether they were phantoms of men's plague-addled minds or merely the specters of fear is unknown, but these demonic visions gave men even more reason to keep hiding behind locked doors. And with all of this happening, harvest couldn't be collected. Crops rotted in the fields and famine loomed. And the plague spared neither the old nor the young, holy men or scoundrels, rich or poor. Everyone got the plague. Everyone, including Justinian. The emperor fell into a deep coma. Soon, the buboes appeared on his thigh. Every day, the city prayed, but everyone knew the plague's course. It was here that Theodora stepped in. Make no mistake, through Justinian's reign, she was working behind the scenes. During the course of his rule, she had worked to find space for both Orthodox and Monophysite Christians in the empire. She had fought for the rights of women and she had always helped with imperial policy. On top of that, Theodora had also served as a sort of informal spy master for Justinian's regime, uncovering plots and fending off any internal threats to Justinian's power. In fact, she had just recently forced Justinian's ruthless tax man, John the Cappadocian, into exile as a priest as punishment for his willingness to entertain a plot against the emperor. And here, now in this critical juncture, as Justinian lay comatose, Theodora took up the fallen reins of power. And this is a remarkable thing: To think that she could do this, that she could hold all of the jackals and potential usurpers at bay. All around, there were generals with armies at their call. The empire itself was in a state of disarray. Any one of these generals could easily claim that the current regime had been forsaken by God, that the emperor had no clear heir, and, by all accounts, he was weeks from death at most. At no point since ""Nika!"" was control of the empire more tenuous. When you consider the fact that Rome, even eastern Rome, had so often suffered civil wars and rebellions, it's incredible that in the midst of this plague and conflict, armies of Romans didn't array themselves against each other, spilling Roman blood to elevate some other ambitious man to the purple. But Theodora served as a unifying thread, as a continuation of imperium. She made all the decisions that would normally come to Justinian. She held the court together and acted as a symbol of perseverance for a city and a nation going through unimaginable suffering. But most of all, she acted quickly and ruthlessly, bringing to heel anyone she suspected might attempt to supplant Justinian. She had men of power arrested, she had generals recalled from their armies, and she had her courtiers listen for any sign of sedition. And through doing so, she prevented the civil war that should've come. But, one of the men she'd had to recall was Belisarius. The world knew of his promise to never seek the purple while Justinian lived, but Justinian was on his death bed. Many naturally assumed that Belisarius would simply take on the mantle of emperor once Justinian passed. And though he had tried to quiet those rumors, numerous Roman factions had started to campaign for pushing out the existing imperial family and installing Belisarius instead. And thus, Theodora recalled him, tried him, and confiscated the vast wealth he had accumulated during his campaigns. She would later use her friendship with Belisarius' wife as an excuse to restore him to favor, but for now, he was stuck cooling his heels in Constantinople, and safely removed from the power struggle, but also from the battlefield. Luckily for the Byzantines, this plague had struck the Persians as well. The war was by no means over, but there was a lull as each of the great empires struggled with their own internal problems and tried to keep their expensively trained troops away from the plague rather than fighting in the field. And so, for weeks, Constantinople existed in torpor, stunned and reeling from the catastrophe that had befallen it. But then, the impossible happened: Justinian woke up. [ending screen with music] "
354,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,RwtO04EXgUE,"It has no taste, color or smell, and we often look right through it. It covers over 70% of the Earth, cycling from the oceans and rivers to the clouds and back again. It even makes up about 60% of our bodies. With all this water around and inside us, it's easy to take its presence for granted. But in the rest of the solar system, liquid water is almost impossible to find. So how did our planet end up with so much of this substance and where did it come from? As you probably know, a water molecule consists  of two basic parts. Hydrogen, the simplest of all elements, has been around since close to the beginning of our universe. Oxygen entered the scene several hundred million years later after stars began to form. The massive pressure at the center of these fiery infernos was so great that hydrogen atoms  fused together to form helium. Helium, in turn, fused to form heavier elements, like beryllium, carbon and oxygen in a process known as nucleosynthesis. When stars eventually collapsed and exploded into supernovas, these new elements were spread across the universe and combined into new compounds, like the now familiar H2O. These water molecules were present in the dusty cloud that formed our solar system and more collided with our planet after its formation. But there's a big question  that we don't have the answer to: how much water arrived on Earth, and when? If, as one theory goes, relatively small amounts of water were present on Earth when the rock formed, the high temperatures  and lack of any surrounding atmosphere would have caused it  to evaporate back into space. Water would have been unable  to remain on the planet until hundreds of millions of years later when our first atmosphere formed through a process called outgassing. This occurred when molten rock in the Earth's core released volcanic gasses to the surface, creating a layer  that could then trap escaping water. So how then did water get back to the planet? Scientists have long suspected that much of it was brought by ice-bearing comets, or more likely asteroids that bombarded the Earth over millions of years. Recent research  has challenged this theory. In examining carbonaceous chondrite meterorites that formed shorty after the birth of our solar system, scientists have found  that not only did they contain water, but their mineral chemical composition matched rocks on Earth and samples from an asteroid that  formed at the same time as our planet. This suggests that the Earth  may have accumulated a substantial amount of water early on that was able to stay put, despite the lack of an atmosphere, though asteroids may have brought more over the eons. If this turns out to be true, life may have formed much earlier than previously thought. So we do not yet definitively know whether the water on Earth came from its initial formation, later impacts, or some combination of the two. Regardless, the water that runs from our showers, drinking fountains and faucets is something that didn't just come from a nearby lake or river, but first underwent a cosmic  and chaotic journey to get here. "
355,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,S1qffXgDqNM,"Night has fallen on the Australian Outback. Police search parties roam wide in search of the Kelly Gang, the cop killers who fled the scene of their crime one week prior. The rain falls heavy, and the river threatens to flood, but a group of officers searches the shore anyway. They spot something, tracks perhaps? They paced the riverbank looking for more, but find nothing. At last, they continue on their way. Once the police have gone from sight, four men emerge from a nearby clump of reeds, up to their noses in water. Soaking and shivering, their guns waterlogged and useless, the Kelly Gang drags themselves back to shore. Just a few more steps to the left, and the police would have found them utterly defenseless. This is the closest anyone will ever get to catching them. ♪ With three officers dead by his hand, Ned Kelly became a fugitive. The government declared the Kelly Gang to be outlaws, offering thousands for their capture, and authorizing every citizen to shoot them dead on sight. But no one seemed eager to claim the reward. Sympathizers across the countryside took the gang in, hid them in barns, misdirected any police search parties that came snooping. And any police who did manage to find the Kelly's trail, would immediately sprint in the opposite direction, fearing for their life. Several leading officers were censured for their cowardice, after blatantly abandoning chance after chance to catch the Kelly Gang. But the police faced an uphill battle, Ned was slowly winning the rest of the country to his side. Ned was determined to be a better kind of bushranger, one who never robbed ordinary people. In fact, if the gang ever had to stay the night at somebody's place or eat their food, Ned would pay them back for it. Ned's beef was with the rich squatters and their pet police force, and he was determined that they would be his only victims. At first, the only member of the gang who really understood this, was Ned's best friend. Joe Byrne. Everybody had always loved Joe. He was well-dressed, well-spoken, charismatic, and most importantly, smart. In Joe, Ned found a reliable right-hand man who not only understood Ned's intentions, but could help him plan it. And Ned had big plans. The way he saw it, the best way to get back at the squatters and undermine their stranglehold on the region's economy, was to hit them where it really hurt: Their wallets. And he knew just the place to do it. A sleepy little town with a sleepy little bank called Euroa. He and Joe put their heads together, and sketched out a plan. First they would seize a way station by the railroad stop, so that they could easily monitor traffic coming in and out of the area. Then they would destroy the telegraph station, to make sure that even if the plan went sour, no one would be able to summon the police in time to stop them. Finally, once they had completely secured the area, then they would rob the bank. On a Monday, December 9th of 1878, Ned rode up to the way station outside Euroa, and asked the groom to take his horse. On a whim, he asked: ""Do you know who I am?"" The old groom glanced up at this rumbled young man, and joked: ""Heh, perhaps you're Ned Kelly."" Ned drew his gun. ""You're a damn fine guesser."" Ned and his crew rounded up every worker and traveler that passed through the station that day, and packed them all into a small locked shed. All except for the women and children of course, they were put in the more comfortable station house. It was the decent thing to do. The gang executed Ned's plan slowly and methodically. They kept their hostages overnight, and even sat down among them to talk and answer questions. Ned was eager to dispel some of the worst myths that had been circulated about him. No, of course he hadn't sawed off dead police officers ears and fingers for trophies. He'd only fired on those three officers in self-defense after they tried to shoot him. By now, the hostages greatly outnumbered the Kelly Gang, but they didn't dare to turn on them. For one thing, they suspected, and they would have been correct, that Ned had invited a few local sympathizers to come by and pretend to be hostages, so that they could alert him of anyone who might be thinking of trying something stupid. For another, many of the actual hostages found this opportunity to interview a bushranger about his crimes fascinating. And Ned was nothing if not a charming and gracious host ...age taker. (Hostage taker) Come the next morning, Ned executed the rest of his plan. Destroying the telegraph office, and robbing the bank. It went off without a hitch. No one had expected them, and they met no real resistance. Ned walked away with well over £2,000 in cash. And just for good measure, he burned every record of debt the bank had, hoping to get a few poor farmers off the hook. He returns to the way station, gave the hostages a small share of the loot to apologize for the trouble, and then rode off with his gang. Ned's legend was growing. As eager newspapers spread the story of Euroa, people began to praise the Kelly Gang. One paper even suggested that the Australian police force should be rebuilt with men like them. Hardy, self-made Australian natives, who treated civilians with courtesy, and weren't afraid to dive into the thick of danger to confront problems. The Kelly Gang made fools of the police, whose disorganized search parties never managed to even catch sight of the gang, and had even once shot at each other in confusion. Disgraced and humiliated, the police began cracking down on suspected Kelly sympathizers, throwing them in jail. But they had no real evidence against anybody. They barely even knew who their suspects were, and they arrested the wrong people several times. The site of police parading these innocent, everyday people through the streets in handcuffs, did nothing to scare Kelly's sympathizers. If anything, it only further convinced them that Ned Kelly was right. The police were crooked and incompetent, and willing to throw anybody in jail to protect their rich squatter friends. More and more citizens began to take Ned Kelly's side, and support for him became so widespread, that the entire area became known as Kelly country. As the months dragged on, the spectacle of arrested sympathizers only grew worse. Time after time, the sympathizers would go to court and demand a trial, only to be denied as the court found every excuse to delay. The police knew that at least some of these people were helping the Kelly Gang, but a trial with no evidence would only set them free to do it again. When the official prosecutor voiced concerns about this, he was promptly fired. But then, a few days later, he returned to the case, now defending Kelly's sympathizers. Ned had hired him with the money he stole from Euroa, and thus, scored another popular victory for his cause. The last of the sympathizers would finally be released without charges after 107 days in prison. Not all the common folk were Kelly fans though. A journalist in the town of Jerilderie, remained steadfast in his opposition to the gang. He wrote an article scolding the police for not taking bank security more seriously. His own town had only two policemen defending it. How could they be expected to defend the local bank from four infamous bushrangers? One month after its publication, four young police officers showed up to reinforce Jerilderie. It would seem that his article had hit home. Turns out, it had, ...just not with the people he had intended. In his effort to whip the police into action, he had given Ned perfect scouting information on Jerilderie's vulnerability. Seizing on this easy target, Ned had snuck into town, caught the two local police officers by surprise, and locked them up in their own jail cell. Then, he and his gang had borrowed uniforms, and spent a day casually strolling about the town, chasing the area. Their plan was the same as last time: Destroy the telegraph station, set up a secure staging area with hostages, and then take the bank. Ned had picked a nearby hotel, and left Joe Byrne and his brother Dan in charge of guarding it, making hostages of any passers-by to keep them from entering the bank. With that settled, Ned and the last gang member Steve Hart, entered the bank. To the surprise of everyone involved, they find the bank manager in a back room, tucked inside a small metal tub, taking his afternoon bath. At gunpoint, the manager agrees to give them the key to the safe... after he finishes his bath. Listen, he really wants this bath Ned, amused by this, assigned Steve to supervise while he goes back out front. Steve has never quite understood Ned's strange insistence on being well-behaved bushrangers. And resentful over having to watch this guy take a stupid bath, he steals the managers watch in retribution. Once the bath is concluded, the bank heist goes well. Another £2,000 are collected, the debt records are destroyed, and the gang returns to the hotel to buy their hostages a round of drinks before letting them go. As Ned is about to leave, however, a friend of the bank manager stops him, and accuses Steve of stealing the watch. Ned is outraged. He reclaims the watch and starts to return it, but... no, he hands it back to Steve and orders him: ""Give it back to him yourself, like a man."" Steve obeys. With his gang's honor restored, Ned jumps on his horse, waves his hat and farewell, and rides off to the cheers of his own former hostages. It would be 17 whole months before the public saw Ned Kelly again. But during that time, he began formulating his most ambitious and deadly plan yet.

357,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,SIlnsP6AjP8,"Last we left off, South Sea shares were at an all time high. But under the surface, things were amiss. The company had burnt through much of the money it made selling stock by giving people ridiculous terms on shares and offering loans to anyone wanting to buy into South Sea; legislating its rivals out of business had caused bankrupt business owners to sell South Sea shares to cover their debt, and to cap it all the company still hadn't made a single cent selling goods in the South Sea. As August came to a close, these cracks had started to show. the company had ceased its meteoric rise and in fact was starting to go south and Blunt knew that if the shares began to fall people would start to take a closer look at South Sea house  and realize just how bad a shape it was in. So Blunt did the only thing Blunt could do: sell more shares at an even higher price. This was Blunt at his Blunt-iest. He opened up a new round of stock for purchase at the impossible price of 1000 pounds a share… while, at the same time, quietly beginning to sell off what stock he owned in his own company. He pushed that fresh batch of stocks hard, though. This time, he offered even more ridiculous incentives, asking for only 10% up front and no payments for a year.   I mean, at this point, that sounds more like a late night TV ad than a stock sale. But, lucky for Blunt, the hype around the South Sea company was still so strong that he was able to sell all of the new stock, bringing in about a million more pounds. This was the last time, though. As Blunt sold these absurdly expensive shares, he had to know that anyone buying in was bound to lose their shirt. The South Sea cash reserves were just too low and the stock price too high for them to conceivably continue to inflate the share value. He’d pushed this monster as far as it could go. And, ironically, the bump in share price that Blunt created with this new inflated round of stock was just what some of the earlier investors were looking for in order to get out. As those who had invested early and taken advantage of the 20% down deal had the rest of their payment come due, many found it to be a good time to walk away rather than reinvest their profits back into the company. One such investor was Robert Walpole. Remember him? The great opponent of the South Sea Company? The man Blunt got locked up way back when they were first forming South Sea? Well despite the whole getting-locked- in-the-tower-of-London incident, he had been making a tidy profit off South Sea stock this whole time and was, in fact, planning to reinvest when his friend and personal financial manager, Robert Jacomb interceded and stopped him from putting money back into South Sea tThis not only saved Walpole his personal fortune but, as we’ll see next week, cemented his reputation in days to come. As South Sea stock inevitably began to droop again, Blunt, having no cash left in the reserves to prop up the share price, tried one last desperate gamble. He offered a dividend of 30% on the stock, with the dividend moving up to 50% for the next ten years. This was meant to be too attractive to pass up, but instead it just made all of those investors who were still dreaming the South Sea dream snap awake. Just to cover this dividend, the company would have to make roughly 15 million pounds a year, or roughly a quarter of the gross domestic product of Great Britain. At long last, the British population thought to themselves: “that seems a little unrealistic...” With confidence in the company vanishing and nothing left in its coffers, the stock began to plummet. It fell hundreds of pounds a week and, by the middle of September, was barely over 150 pounds a share.  This, down from Blunt’s 1000 pound shares sale just some three weeks earlier. Anybody who had invested late, and especially anybody who had taken out loans to do so, was ruined. Bankruptcies were rampant and suicides only slightly less so. Soon, even the old &lt;i&gt;Hollow Sword Blade Company&lt;/i&gt; closed up shop with nothing more than a nice note on the door saying they would certainly cover any of their existing obligations, so just, please, check back... uh... later... Unfortunately, no one informed the king, who was on holiday in his native Hannover. So, as the South Sea Company fell apart, so did the royal finances. Which leads us nicely to the final chapter of this tale: the fallout. Do you remember how Walpole had originally tried to convince the government to lock the shares that South Sea could swap for debt to a fixed value? And remember earlier how his friend, Jacomb, had made him divest himself of all of his stock before the collapse? Well, Walpole saw an opportunity in this. he presented himself as the righteous defender of the public against the madness of markets, attempting to seize this chance to get the public on his side and to finally get even with those who had locked him up so many years ago But Walpole was a man of wheels within wheels, and beneath this new public persona and only slightly-veiled chance for revenge,  he was secretly playing at a much greater opportunity: a chance to take over the government. It would be a dicey game, because he'd have to make it look like he was helping his fellow Whigs while, at the same time, making sure that the current leaders of the Whig party got caught in the blast radius from the South Sea scandal. He would also need to save the King from the fallout, because he would need the King’s favor if he was going to take over. Besides, if the King went down with the South Sea company, the Whigs might lose everything, and that wouldn’t fit Walpole’s plans at all. Luckily for him, the Whig leadership had only one real plan: to have the Bank of England bail out their hated rival, South Sea. And, even more luckily, he still had friends in the Bank of England from back when he first tried to have the government give the debt to the Bank instead of South Sea. Walpole negotiated a much better deal with the Bank than the rest of the leadership could, convincing them and the &lt;i&gt;East India Company&lt;/i&gt; to offer to swap their stock  for the now nearly worthless South Sea stock people were stuck with. He also got all outstanding debt that people owed the South Sea company for buying stock on credit canceled, which made him a public hero. Many people still lost their shirts, but at least now they wouldn't lose their whole wardrobe. The British public was still in a fervor though, and a parliamentary inquiry was demanded. This complicated Walpole’s plans somewhat. On the one hand, he needed to appear to be all for rooting out the insidious corruption that had ruined so many. On the other hand, if anyone started looking closely at what had really gone on, the Whigs, the King, and even perhaps Walpole himself, would soon be implicated. This juggling act was about to get complicated. and it was all about to come to a head around a man named &lt;i&gt;Robert Knight&lt;/i&gt; and his little green ledger. Join us next week  for the conclusion of the South Sea bubble as we dive into the fallout from the collapse of the South Sea Company, find out the ultimate fate of all of our actors, and learn the wild tale of the small green book that had the power to take down the most powerful government in the world.

358,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,SXXrQlJoNsw,"The discovery of an alien monolith  on planet RH-1729 has scientists across the world  racing to unlock its mysteries. Your engineering team has developed  an elegant probe to study it. The probe is a collection  of 27 cube modules capable of running all the scientific  tests necessary to analyze the monolith. The modules can self-assemble  into a large 3x3x3 cube, with each individual module placed anywhere in the cube, and at any orientation. It can also break itself apart  and reassemble into any other orientation. Now comes your job. The probe will need a special  protective coating for each of the extreme environments it passes through. The red coating will seal it against  the cold of deep space, the purple coating will protect it  from the intense heat as it enters the atmosphere of RH-1729, and the green coating will shield it from the alien planet’s electric storms. You can apply the coatings to each of the faces of all 27 of the cubic modules in any way you like, but each face can only  take a single color coating. You need to figure out how you  can apply the colors so the cubes can re-assemble themselves to show only red, then purple, then green. How can you apply the colored coatings  to the 27 cubes so the probe will be able  to make the trip? Pause here if you want to figure it out yourself. You can start by painting the outside of the complete cube red, since you’ll need that regardless. Then you can break it into 27 pieces,  and look at what you have. There are 8 corner cubes,  which each have three red faces, 12 edge cubes, which have two red faces, 6 face cubes, which have 1 red face, and a single center cube,  which has no red faces. You’ve painted a total of 54 faces red  at this point, so you’ll need the same number of faces  for the green and purple cubes, too. When you’re done,  you’ll have painted 54 faces red, 54 faces green, and 54 faces purple. That’s 162 faces, which is precisely how many the cubes have in total. So there’s no margin for waste. If there’s any way to do this, it’ll probably be highly symmetrical. Maybe you can use that to help you. You look at the center cube. You’d better paint it half green  and half purple, so you can use it as a corner  for each of those cubes, and not waste a single face. There’ll need to be center cubes with no green and no purple too. So you take 2 corner cubes  from the red cube and paint the 3 blank faces of 1 purple, and the 3 blank faces of the other green. Now you’ve got the 6 face cubes that each have 1 face painted red. That leaves 5 empty faces on each. You can split them in half. In the first group,  you paint 3 faces green and 2 faces purple; In the second group,  paint 3 faces purple and 2 green. Counting on symmetry, you replicate these piles again with the colors rearranged. That gives you 6 with 1 green face, 6 with 1 red face, and 6 with 1 purple face. Counting up what you’ve completely painted, you see 8 corner cubes in each color, 6 edge cubes in each color, 6 face cubes in each color, and 1 center cube. That means you just need 6 more edge cubes in green and purple. And there are exactly 6 cubes left, each with 4 empty faces. You paint 2 faces of each green  and 2 faces of each purple. And now you have a cube that’s perfectly  painted to make an incredible trip. It rearranges itself  to be red in deep space, purple as it enters RH-1729’s atmosphere, and green when it flies through the electric storms. As it reaches the monolith, you realize you’ve achieved something humans have dreamt of for eons: alien contact. "
359,Education,27,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,SXe9WCeccOw,"This is the first staged photo. It depicts a suicide. But it also tells a story. Of an ambitious amateur inventor who found a way to achieve the incredible. But was pushed aside by a powerful, meddling politician with his own agenda. And doomed to obscurity. Hippolyte Bayard was an artist. A gardener. A collector. And an experimenter. And in 1839, he invented photography – sort of. People knew for centuries how to create an image with light, but they didn’t have a way to permanently fix it onto a surface. Until several people actually figured it out all at once. They invented their own methods, building on years of individual experimentation and failed attempts. Bayard, in France, was one of them. He was experimenting with photography in his free time while working a day job in a government office. He found a way to fix images by dipping paper into photosensitive chemicals and exposing it to light inside a camera obscura, which is essentially a dark room with a tiny hole in it. You can actually see stains from excess chemicals in his earliest successful attempts. His photographs prominently featured his home and garden, where he would arrange tools, statues, and vases into loaded still lifes. Also windmills. He loved windmills. Often he included himself in the scenes, eyes closed because of the long exposure time his process required. But he’s not the photo pioneer you might have heard of. That would be this guy: fellow Frenchman Louis Daguerre. Daguerre had already made a name for himself and captured the public’s attention in the 1820s with popular interactive art shows, called “dioramas.” Fixing an image to a surface was his next big ambition. And by the late 1830s, he’d had his own breakthrough with photography, successfully creating a process to fix an image to a metal plate. He called his invention the Daguerreotype. He kept his discovery mostly under wraps, showing the Daguerreotypes to just a few influential members of society, who would then spread rumors of his success to the press. Bayard, on the other hand, worked alone, but he was eager to share his work. In June 1839 he held a photo exhibition, becoming the first photographer to show his work in public. One attendee later wrote, “they were like nothing I’d ever seen… they unite the impression of reality with the fantasy of dreams.” Bayard was prepared to demonstrate his process to the Academy of Sciences, the highest scientific authority in France. And that’s where Francois Arago steps in. A prominent French politician and astronomer, and Chair of the Academy of Sciences. He was also a supporter of Daguerre's, and after being shown successful Daguerreotypes in late 1838, he set out to arrange a deal with the French government to purchase the rights to the invention. He wanted photography to be France’s gift to the world, and Daguerre was going to be the man to deliver it. So when Bayard showed Arago his successful prints, the politician persuaded him to hold off on announcing the details of his method until the Daguerre deal was finished. And on August 19th, 1839, standing before the Academy of Sciences with Daguerre seated right next to him, Francois Arago revealed the exact process for creating a Daguerreotype. That moment is considered the birth of photography. And once the French government made the details of the process public, Daguerreotyping spread like wildfire, becoming the first practical, widespread method of making pictures. Daguerre was awarded a lifetime government pension, and the principle credit for inventing photography — sealing his place in the history books. A couple months later, Bayard finally got his chance with the Academy and demonstrated his own process. But it was too late. Daguerreotyping was already established, and the Academy wasn’t interested in pursuing his alternative technique. And as a response, Bayard killed himself. Well, metaphorically. The tongue-in-cheek caption he wrote on the back of this self-portrait reads: “The corpse which you see here is that of Monsieur Bayard, inventor of the process that has just been shown to you.” “The government which has been only too generous to Monsieur Daguerre, has said it can do nothing for Monsieur Bayard, and the poor wretch has drowned himself.” The image itself is rich with symbols that Bayard included to hint at his perceived injustice. First, he posed nude, partially covered in a shroud, a symbol people would have recognized from iconic paintings depicting martyrs. Another important detail that would have resonated with 19th century Parisians is in the caption: “He has been at the morgue for several days, and no-one has recognized or claimed him.” The Paris Morgue at this time was open every day to the public, in hopes that people would claim unidentified bodies — many of them anonymous suicides. Bayard’s protest is all about recognition – or lack thereof – so the morgue is a fitting metaphor. Just like morgue victims, he’s on display – propped up and surrounded by personal effects that might give a clue to the corpse’s identity. In Bayard’s case, a broad-brimmed straw hat and, as a second attempt at the photo shows more clearly, a floral vase and a statue. Objects that, along with the inventor himself, were recurring visual themes in his work and would have been strong indicators of the identity of the drowned man, should anyone recognize them, or him, at all. Bayard went on experimenting with photography in the years following his “suicide” and even became a founding member of the French Society of Photography. But of the many photographs taken over his long career, it’s this one that is the most talked about and analyzed. And that’s because this isn’t just the first staged photo – it’s an early example of photography showing something non-literal and symbolic. Laying the groundwork for exploring the medium’s potential for creative expression and establishing from the very beginning that a photograph doesn’t always show the truth. If you want to check out more of Bayard's photographs, or see some of the research that informed this video, there's links to that in the description. I'll also be sharing some sources that I used for inspiration and story ideas in the Video Lab, our membership program.

361,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,SuidVI9ENN8," Welcome back, friends, to the final installment of the Extra History of England series voiced splendiferously by the history of England podcast host David Crowther. Thanks so much for lending your voice to this series, David! It was my pleasure, Matthew. Thank you so much for having me.  And to think I made it this whole series without trying to do a faux English accent Yes, we're all very proud of you for that bit of restraint Right, let's get the end of our tale Ecclesiastes chapter 10 verse 16 was much quoted in the Middle Ages: ""woe to their land when thy King is a child."" In France minorities had often been disastrous.  England's experience was very different. In Henry VI's minority, Henry V's two surviving brothers John the Duke of Bedford and Humphrey Duke of Gloucester and a Regency Council were to guide England safely through the minority until Henry VI assumed his place and England was to wish that her King had never come of age at all. Bedford was the eldest of Henry V's sons He was an impressive man intelligent, a good diplomat, a strategist, and a decent military commander.  To him was assigned the role of commander and governor of France. From his magnificent palace he built in Rouen and from Paris Bedford ruled as much of France as had accepted Henry VI as King. Gloucester was a slightly different kettle of fish He was surely loyal intelligent and cultured but he was also volatile and a populist Parliament and the King's Council did not entirely trust him So rather than be sole regent in England Gloucester was made protector, head of the council only. Gloucester whined continually about this but never to the point of rebellion. During the minority the English strategy was to hold what they'd won while making itty-bitty border raids into the rest of France for defensive purposes only, of course Meanwhile Charles VI of France died in 1422 and his son the Daufin became Charles VII.  As the English held Paris he had to set up his court at the ancient royal city of Chinon, south of the river Loire. The English-held France of Henry VI was organized for defense with garrisons and key towns throughout Normandy and Greater Anjou.  The inhabitants were part of the English administration They submitted taxation to maintain their own defence.  For six years Charles got nowhere. In fact, at Vernois in 1424, Bedford won as completed victories as Agincourt and Crécy had ever been. England was once again blessed with talented commanders in men like Salisbury and Tolbert. At Chinon, Charles VII's court was a despairing depressed mess of defeatism. And then in 1428 something truly remarkable happened. The English were besieging the city of Orléans. First, a cannonball took the life of Salisbury, the best English commander. And then at Charles's quarter, Chinon, there appeared a French peasant girl She claimed that God had sent her a vision to lead the French King to victory Now religious mystics were honored in the Middle Ages So although he saw no more chance of success than a snowball at a summer fête, and gave her little or no support, Charles allowed her to travel to Orléans. Joan of Arc, called the Maid of Orléans, as she became known to history, did not lack for confidence Sorry to interrupt David but if our viewers want to know more about Joan our patrons voted for a full series on her life Which will air right after this special series ends. So, you know if you could just have no spoilers though I guess there's no way to not spoil so just Keep calm and carry on I'll show myself out. Against all expectations Joan won around the hardened French soldiers trapped in Orléans and inspired them. They counter-attacked with the Maid of Orléans at their head dressed in shining armor And they threw the English from the siege.  The English fell back in chaos and confusion. Three critical English fortresses fell one by one. And then came the unthinkable the hated invincible English archers were ridden down and destroyed at the Battle of Patay The spell had been broken: the English could be defeated. In the following year, 1429, there in the cathedral in a blaze of glory Charles followed his ancestors and was crowned king of France and there was nothing Bedford could do to stop them All he could do was watch in helpless fury. And then the maid of Orléans turned on Paris itself It had been the greatest comeback since Lazarus, but it was here that Joan's momentum was stopped. Within six months Miss d'Arc had been captured, and in May 1430 was burned as a heretic in Rouen But she had lit a fire the English couldn't put out. Her story is just incredible.  Like any legend there is much exaggeration that attached itself to her but the sight of a peasant girl leading armies to war is astounding and she transformed the war.  From now on the Anglo Burgundian alliance was always on the defensive. In 1431, Bedford organized the coronation of the nine-year-old Henry VI in Paris as King of France But although Bedford did his best to organize a new offensive, the English Treasury was bare. The cost of maintaining these garrisons was bleeding England and her Burgundian allies dry. Now the Duke of Burgundy no longer believed England was capable of winning, and so a massive diplomatic conference was held in 1435. Hundreds of diplomats gathered every day from France, Burgundy, and England in front of the papal mediator England watch helplessly as Burgundy and Charles kissed hugged made up and agreed They were not scared of the English pig dogs and made a separate peace. It was a disaster for England.  It drove the nail into the coffin of English-held France hammered home by the news that Bedford himself was dead. In England, at the Palace of Westminster, Henry VI sat on his throne in the presence chamber and announced that he was now 15 the Minority was ended and he assumed his role as King of England. But Henry VI had little in common with his warrior father.  Henry VI could have done with either a bit more hero or A good dose of monster because as it was he was better suited for the church than the throne Henry VI was indecisive, weak-willed, he hated war, and wanted only peace with France at any cost. For a while, the Duke of Suffolk, the King's chief adviser, tried to protect his young King For 10 years the war of attrition in France dragged on. England was outgunned and alone But commanders like Tolbert and Richard Duke of York fiercely held the line. Charles and Burgundy could not break the English grip on Normandy, Maine, and Anjou The logjam was finally broken by a truce of such stunning naivety that the mind literally boggles. Henry VI wanted peace and Henry VI wanted a wife. In 1445 it appeared that Suffolk had negotiated both. Henry's wife was to be Margaret of Anjou, a minor French princess, and King Charles of France gave some vague promises that he would come up with some suitable peace proposals but to pay for the marriage all of Maine and Anjou would have to be handed back to France. Obviously, this is a laughable proposal ha ha ha without the solid agreement of peace no one would be stupid enough to give away two entire provinces. So you guessed it, This is exactly what Henry and Suffolk did. At first, no one in England understood what had happened. Margaret of Anjou became Queen and the streets of London ran with wine as they celebrated But by 1447 the streets of London ran with refugees from Maine and Anjou.  King Charles had no new peace proposals except permission to leave very quietly and give back everything Henry V had won. People began to understand what had been done in their name. what had been given away by Suffolk and Henry and that English blood had been shed in vain. But now the levee was breached the flood began. In 1450 the last battle in northern France took place at a village called Formigny. The English were slaughtered and the last Englishmen fled Normandy. Never to return. The end in Gascony was not far behind. In 1453 England's last competent commander of the glory days Tolbert died in the cannon fire of the Battle of Castillon. Bordeaux and Gascony finally fell to the French 300 years after Eleanor of Aquitaine had brought them to the Plantagenet dynasty The immediate impact was political chaos Suffolk could tried to hang on to power by having the outraged Duke of Gloucester seized and thrown into jail Where he died from a heart attack. But now Suffolk's enemies gathered and forced him from power. Henry tried to protect his loyal hard-working servant In this he was not entirely successful. Suffolk's head was in fact found stuck on a pole on the beach and the rest of his body had a hard time enjoying life without it. Remarkably, political poems appeared directly attacking the king.  Now this was exceptional. The king was God's anointed.  He could do no wrong in the medieval world Political criticism was always directed at the King's advisers. The enemies of Henry began to gather around the son of that man executed by Henry V in 1415, Richard Duke of York. Very soon the incompetence of Henry VI would launch England on 30 years of destructive civil war known to history as the Wars of the Roses so while the Hundred Years War and the English conquest of France came to a crushing end, In the longer view, in defeat was for England, victory. the hundred and sixteen year struggle helped define the English. English was now the official language and had helped build a joint sense of purpose in the nation. Geoffrey Chaucer and his Canterbury Tales made English for the first time acceptable as a language of culture. Edward III and Henry V had made it the language of government. During the religious wars of the sixteenth century this sense of unity would enable England to defeat the mightiest Armada Europe had ever seen. In France, the French Kings were forced to centralize and tackle separatist forces and by so doing with the fall of the dukes of Burgundy France became the arbiter of Europe. And lastly, the later history of England is unthinkable with lands in France. With their continental ambitions crushed, England would turn to the New World. To the Caribbean, the Americas, the East and create a commercial empire that would in turn make her the most powerful nation on Earth. "

But around 800 BCE, that began to change: the value of bronze declined, causing social upheaval and an economic crisis— what we would call a recession today. What causes recessions? This question has long been the subject of heated debate among economists, and for good reason. A recession can be a mild decline in  economic activity in a single country that lasts months, a long-lasting downturn with global ramifications that last years, or anything in between. Complicating matters further, there are countless variables that contribute to an economy’s health, making it difficult to pinpoint specific causes. So it helps to start with the big picture: recessions occur when there is a negative  disruption to the balance between supply and demand. There’s a mismatch between how many goods people want to buy, how many products and services producers  can offer, and the price of the goods and services sold, which prompts an economic decline. An economy’s relationship between supply  and demand is reflected in its inflation rates  and interest rates. Inflation happens when goods and services  get more expensive. Put another way, the value  of money decreases. Still, inflation isn’t necessarily  a bad thing. In fact, a low inflation rate is thought  to encourage economic activity. But high inflation that isn’t accompanied  with high demand can both cause problems for an economy  and eventually lead to a recession. Interest rates, meanwhile, reflect the cost of taking on debt for individuals and companies. The rate is typically an annual percentage of a loan that borrowers pay to their creditors  until the loan is repaid. Low interest rates mean that companies  can afford to borrow more money, which they can use to invest  in more projects. High interest rates, meanwhile, increase  costs for producers and consumers, slowing economic activity. Fluctuations in inflation and interest  rates can give us insight into the health  of the economy, but what causes these fluctuations  in the first place? The most obvious causes are shocks  like natural disaster, war, and geopolitical factors. An earthquake, for example, can destroy the infrastructure needed to produce important commodities such as oil. That forces the supply side of the economy to charge more for products that use oil, discouraging demand and potentially prompting a recession. But some recessions occur in times of economic prosperity— possibly even because  of economic prosperity. Some economists believe that business  activity from a market’s expansion can occasionally reach  an unsustainable level. For example, corporations and consumers  may borrow more money with the assumption that economic growth will help them handle the added burden. But if the economy doesn’t grow as quickly as expected, they may end up with more debt  than they can manage. To pay it off, they’ll have to redirect  funds from other activities, reducing business activity. Psychology can also contribute  to a recession. Fear of a recession can become a  self-fulfilling prophecy if it causes people to pull back investing and spending. In response, producers might  cut operating costs to help weather the expected decline in demand. That can lead to a vicious cycle as cost cuts eventually lower wages, leading to even lower demand. Even policy designed to help prevent  recessions can contribute. When times are tough, governments and  central banks may print money, increase spending, and lower central bank interest rates. Smaller lenders can in turn lower their  interest rates, effectively making debt “cheaper”  to boost spending. But these policies are not sustainable  and eventually need to be reversed to prevent excessive inflation. That can cause a recession if people have become too reliant on cheap debt and government stimulus. The Bronze recession in Britain eventually ended when the adoption of iron helped revolutionize farming  and food production. Modern markets are more complex, making today’s recessions far more difficult to navigate. But each recession provides new data to help anticipate and respond to future recessions more effectively. "
363,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,T24hdchCVIg,"Between 2008 and 2012, archeologists excavated the rubble of an ancient hospital in England. In the process, they uncovered a number of skeletons. One in particular belonged  to a wealthy male who lived in the 11th or 12th century and died of leprosy between the ages of 18 and 25. How do we know all this? Simply by examining some old, soil-caked bones? Even centuries after death, skeletons carry unique features that tell us about their identities. And using modern tools and techniques, we can read those features as clues. This is a branch of science known as biological anthropology. It allows researchers to piece together details about ancient individuals and identify historical events that affected whole populations. When researchers uncover a skeleton, some of the first clues they gather, like age and gender, lie in its morphology, which is the structure, appearance, and size of a skeleton. Bones, like the clavicle,  stop growing at age 25, so a skeleton with a clavicle that hasn't fully formed must be younger than that. Similarly, the plates in the cranium can continue fusing up to age 40, and sometimes beyond. By combining these with some  microscopic skeletal clues, physical anthropologists can estimate an approximate age of death. Meanwhile, pelvic bones reveal gender. Biologically, female pelvises are wider, allowing women to give birth, where as males are narrower. Bones also betray the signs  of ancient disease. Disorders like anemia leave their traces on the bones. And the condition of teeth  can reveal clues to factors like diet and malnutrition, which sometimes correlate with wealth or poverty. A protein called collagen can give us even more profound details. The air we breathe, water we drink, and food we eat leaves permanent traces in our bones and teeth in the form of chemical compounds. These compounds contain measurable quantities called isotopes. Stable isotopes in bone collagen and tooth enamel varies among mammals dependent on where they lived and what they ate. So by analyzing these isotopes, we can draw direct inferences regarding the diet and location of historic people. Not only that, but during life, bones undergo a constant cycle of remodeling. So if someone moves from one place to another, bones synthesized after that move will also reflect the new isotopic  signatures of the surrounding environment. That means that skeletons can be used like migratory maps. For instance, between 1-650 AD, the great city of Teotihuacan in Mexico bustled with thousands of people. Researchers examined the isotope ratios in skeletons' tooth enamel, which held details of their diets when they were young. They found evidence for significant migration into the city. A majority of the individuals were born elsewhere. With further geological  and skeletal analysis, they may be able to map where those people came from. That work in Teotihuacan is also an example of how bio-anthropologists study skeletons in cemeteries and mass graves, then analyze their similarities  and differences. From that information, they can learn about cultural beliefs, social norms, wars, and what caused their deaths. Today, we use these tools to answer big questions about how forces, like migration and disease, shape the modern world. DNA analysis is even possible in some relatively well-preserved ancient remains. That's helping us understand how diseases like tuberculosis have evolved over the centuries so we can build better treatments for people today. Ancient skeletons can tell us a surprisingly great deal about the past. So if your remains are someday buried intact, what might archeologists  of the distant future learn from them? "
364,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,TGLYcYCm2FM,"If you know an older left-handed person, chances are they had to learn to write or eat with their right hand. And in many parts of the world, it's still common practice to force children to use their ""proper"" hand. Even the word for right also means correct or good, not just in English, but many other languages, too. But if being left-handed is so wrong, then why does it happen in the first place? Today, about 1/10 of the world's population are left-handed. Archeological evidence shows that it's been that way for as long as 500,000 years, with about 10% of human remains showing the associated differences in arm length and bone density, and some ancient tools and artifacts showing evidence of left-hand use. And despite what many may think, handedness is not a choice. It can be predicted even before birth based on the fetus' position in the womb. So, if handedness is inborn, does that mean it's genetic? Well, yes and no. Identical twins, who have the same genes, can have different dominant hands. In fact, this happens as often as it does with any other sibling pair. But the chances of being right or left-handed are determined by the handedness of your parents in surprisingly consistent ratios. If your father was left-handed but your mother was right-handed, you have a 17% chance of being born left-handed, while two righties will have a left-handed child only 10% of the time. Handedness seems to be determined by a roll of the dice, but the odds are set by your genes. All of this implies there's a reason that evolution has produced this small proportion of lefties, and maintained it over the course of millennia. And while there have been several theories attempting to explain why handedness exists in the first place, or why most people are right-handed, a recent mathematical model suggests that the actual ratio reflects a balance between competitive and cooperative pressures on human evolution. The benefits of being left-handed are clearest in activities involving an opponent, like combat or competitive sports. For example, about 50% of top hitters in baseball have been left-handed. Why? Think of it as a surprise advantage. Because lefties are a minority to begin with, both right-handed and left-handed competitors will spend most of their time encountering and practicing against righties. So when the two face each other, the left-hander will be better prepared against this right-handed opponent, while the righty will be thrown off. This fighting hypothesis, where an imbalance in the population results in an advantage for left-handed fighters or athletes, is an example of negative frequency-dependent selection. But according to the principles of evolution, groups that have a relative advantage tend to grow until that advantage disappears. If people were only fighting and competing throughout human evolution, natural selection would lead to more lefties being the ones that made it until there were so many of them, that it was no longer a rare asset. So in a purely competitive world, 50% of the population would be left-handed. But human evolution has been shaped by cooperation, as well as competition. And cooperative pressure pushes handedness distribution in the opposite direction. In golf, where performance doesn't depend on the opponent, only 4% of top players are left-handed, an example of the wider phenomenon of tool sharing. Just as young potential golfers can more easily find a set of right-handed clubs, many of the important instruments that have shaped society were designed for the right-handed majority. Because lefties are worse at using these tools, and suffer from higher accident rates, they would be less successful in a purely cooperative world, eventually disappearing from the population. So by correctly predicting the distribution of left-handed people in the general population, as well as matching data from various sports, the model indicates that the persistence of lefties as a small but stable minority reflects an equilibrium that comes from competitive and cooperative effects playing out simultaneously over time. And the most intriguing thing is what the numbers can tell us about various populations. From the skewed distribution of pawedness in cooperative animals, to the slightly larger percentage of lefties in competitive hunter-gatherer societies, we may even find that the answers to some puzzles of early human evolution are already in our hands.

365,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,TWbzjGIec20,"You may think you know the words that sit plainly in black on your page, but don't be fooled. Some words are capable of taking on different guises, masquerading as nouns, verbs and adjectives that alter their meanings entirely. This seeming superpower is called lexical ambiguity. It can turn words and sentences into mazes that mess with our minds. For example, consider the following: Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo. That may sound like nonsense, but it's actually a grammatically  correct sentence. How? Well, Buffalo is proper noun, a noun, and a verb. It refers to an animal also known as a bison, an American city, and it can also mean to bully. These different interpretations create a sequence of words that is grammatically  correct as it stands, though it helps to add in a few implied phrases and punctuation marks to reveal what's really going on. Buffalo buffalo are bison  from the city of Buffalo, and this sentence has three groups of them. Group A, which is bullied by Group B, bullies Group C. In other words, bison from Buffalo that other bison from Buffalo bully also bully bison from Buffalo. If you let each buffalo perform its role, the meaning becomes apparent. What if the bunch of bullying buffalo decides to cross the ocean? Not just on any ship, but a ship-shipping ship shipping shipping-ships? That sentence sounds just as outrageous, but there's logic to the babble. Ship can mean a vessel and to transport. When we sub in those meanings, a clearer picture emerges. Here we have a huge ship-carrying vessel transporting ships that themselves are designed to carry goods across the sea. A ship-shipping ship, shipping shipping-ships. How about some entertainment on board this unusual vessel to offset the scuffling buffalo? Consider the can-can. Can-can can-can can can can can can-can. Here, the word can comes in many guises. There's can-can, the flamboyant dance, can, that means able to, and can, figuratively  meaning to outperform. By sticking in a comma and including the implied meanings, this sentence becomes clearer. Can-can dances that can-can dances are able to outperform, can also outperform other can-can dances. You wouldn't necessarily use any of these sentences in a conversation. They're just too ridiculous. Yet they serve as an extreme example on just how tangled  everyday language can be. Lexical ambiguities sail into our speech and writing all the time, spreading confusion and misunderstanding wherever they can-can. "
366,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Tb6QX9Yy1GM,"If you ask people whether  they think stealing is wrong, most of them would answer, ""Yes."" And yet, in 2013, organizations all over the world lost an estimated total of 3.7 trillion dollars to fraud, which includes crimes like embezzlement, pyramid schemes, and false insurance claims. This wasn't just the work of a few bad apples. The truth is that many people are susceptible not only to the temptation to commit fraud but to convincing themselves that they've done nothing wrong. So why does fraud happen? While individual motivations may differ from case to case, the fraud triangle, a model developed by criminologist Donald Cressey, shows three conditions  that make fraud likely: pressure, opportunity, and rationalization. Pressure is often what motivates someone to engage in fraud to begin with. It could be a personal debt, an addiction, an earnings quota, a sudden job loss, or an illness in the family. As for opportunity, many people in both public and private sectors have access to tools that enable them to commit and conceal fraud: corporate credit cards, internal company data, or control over the budget. The combination of pressure and being exposed to such opportunities on a daily basis can create a strong temptation. But even with these two elements, most fraud still requires rationalization. Many fraudsters are first time offenders, so in order to commit an act most would regard as wrong, they need to justify it to themselves. Some feel entitled to the money because they are underpaid and overworked and others believe  their fraud is victimless, perhaps even planning to return the money once their crisis is resolved. Some of the most common types of fraud don't even register as such to the perpetrator. Examples include employees fudging time sheets or expense reports, taxpayers failing to report cash earnings, or service providers overbilling insurance companies. Though these may seem small, and can sometimes only involve hundreds of dollars, they all contribute to the big picture. And then there's fraud on a massive scale. In 2003, Italian dairy food giant Parmalat went bankrupt after it was found to have fabricated a 4 billion dollar bank account and falsified financial statements to hide the fact that its subsidiaries had been losing money. Because it was family controlled, corporate governance and regulator supervision were difficult, and the company likely hoped that the losses could be recouped before anyone found out. And it's not just corporate greed. Governments and non-profits are also susceptible to fraud. During her time as City Comptroller for Dixon, Illinois, Rita Crundwell embezzled  over 53 million dollars. Rita was one of the country's leading  quarter horse breeders and winner of 52 world championships. But the cost of maintaining the herd ran to 200,000 dollars per month. Because her position gave her complete control over city finances, she was easily able to divert money to an account she used  for private expenses, and the scheme went unnoticed for 20 years. It is believed that Crundwell felt entitled to a lavish lifestyle based on her position, and the notoriety her winnings brought to the city. It's tempting to think of fraud as a victimless crime because corporations and civic institutions aren't people. But fraud harms real people in virtually every case: the employees of Parmalat  who lost their jobs, the citizens of Dixon whose taxes subsidized horse breeding, the customers of companies which raise their prices to offset losses. Sometimes the effects are obvious and devestating, like when Bernie Madoff caused thousands of people to lose their life savings. But often they're subtle and not easy to untangle. Yet someone, somewhere is left holding the bill. "
367,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Ts3LIirgDbU,"Roald Amundsen had spent nearly two years preparing his Arctic expedition. He had secured funding from the Norwegian Crown and hand-picked a trusted crew. He’d even received the blessing of the famed explorer Fridtjof Nansen, along with the use of his ship, Fram, specially constructed to withstand the ice. Now, with the voyage departing, he had  one final announcement to his shipmates: They were going to head in the opposite direction. By the early 20th century, nearly every region of the globe had been visited and mapped, with only two key locations remaining: the North Pole, deep in the frozen waters of the Arctic region, and the South Pole, nestled within a recently discovered icy continent in the vast Antarctic Ocean. A veteran of several expeditions,  Amundsen had long dreamed of reaching the North Pole. But in 1909, amidst his preparations, news came that the American explorers Frederick Cook and Robert Peary had staked rival claims to the achievement. Instead of abandoning the planned voyage, Amundsen decided to alter its course to what he called “the last great problem.” But Amundsen’s crew weren’t  the only ones kept in the dark. British naval officer Robert F. Scott had already visited the Antarctic, and was leading his own  South Pole expedition. Now, as Scott’s ship Terra Nova reached Melbourne in 1910, he was greeted with the news that Amundsen was also heading south. Reluctantly, Scott found himself pitted against the Norwegian in what the newspapers  called a ‘race to the Pole.’ Yet if it was a race, it was a strange one. The expeditions left at different times from different locations, and they had very different  plans for the journey. Amundsen was focused solely on reaching the Pole. Informed by his Arctic exploration, he drew on both Inuit and  Norwegian experience, arriving with a small team of men and more than a hundred dogs. His explorers were clothed in sealskin and furs, as well as specially designed skis and boots. But Scott's venture was more complicated. Launching an extensive scientific research expedition, he traveled with over three times  more men than Amundsen, alongside over 30 dogs,  19 Siberian ponies, and three state-of-the-art motorized sledges. But these additional tools and bodies weighed down the ship as it battled the storms of the southern ocean. And as they finally began to lay supplies, they found both their ponies and motor-sledges ineffective in the harsh ice and snow. In the spring of 1911, after waiting out the long polar night, both parties began the journey south.  Scott’s team traveled over the Beardmore Glacier, following the path of Ernest Shackleton's earlier attempt to reach the pole. But although this course had been documented, it proved slow and laborious. Meanwhile, despite an initial false start, Amundsen’s five-man team made good time using a previously uncharted route through the same Transantarctic Mountains. They stayed ahead of Scott’s team, and on December 14, arrived first at their desolate destination. To avoid the ambiguity that surrounded Cook and Peary’s North Pole claims, Amundsen’s team traversed the area in a grid to make sure they covered the Pole’s location. Along with flags and a tent marker, they left a letter for Scott, which would not be found until over a month later. But when Scott’s party finally reached the pole, losing the ‘race’ was the least of their problems.  On the way back towards the camp, two of the five men succumbed to frostbite starvation, and exhaustion. The remaining explorers hoped for a prearranged rendezvous with a team sent from their base, but due to a series of mishaps, misjudgements and miscommunications, their rescue never arrived. Their remains, along with Scott’s diary, would not be found until spring. Today, scientists from various countries live and work at Antarctic research stations. But the journeys of these early explorers are not forgotten. Despite their divergent fates, they are forever joined in history, and in the name of the research base that marks the South Pole. "
368,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,U69LIr0OrNc,"It's easy to forget how vast and deep the ocean really is. About 60% of it is actually a cold and dark region known as the deep ocean. And it reaches down to 11,000 meters. Yet, this remote zone is also one of the greatest habitats on Earth, harboring a huge diversity of life, from giant squids and goblin sharks to minuscule animals smaller than a millimeter. How do so many species thrive in this underwater world? Over the decades, intrepid scientists have ventured there to find out. Traveling down through the water column, pressure increases  and light begins to wane. At 200 meters, photosynthesis stops and temperature decreases from surface temperatures by up to 20 degrees Celsius. By 1000 meters, normal sunlight has disappeared altogether. Without light, life as we know it seems impossible. That's why in 1844, the naturalist  Edward Forbes wrote his Azoic Theory, Azoic, meaning without animals. Forbes was sure that nothing could survive below 600 meters on account of the lack of light. Of course, the discovery of deep-sea species proved him wrong. What Forbes failed to take into account is something called marine snow, which sounds much nicer than it is. Marine snow is basically organic matter, things like particles of dead algae, plants, and animals, drifting down into the depths and acting as food for deep-sea animals. Largely thanks to that, abundant life forms exist in the darkness, adapting to a harsh reality where only the weird and wonderful can survive. Fish with cavernous mouths, spiky teeth jutting from their jaws, and lamp-like structures  protruding from their heads, like the anglerfish which entices prey with its misleading glow. Several sea creatures have perfected this lightning technique known as bioluminescence, using it to lure prey, distract predators, or attract mates. Some creatures use it for camoflauge. In parts of the water column where only faint blue light filters through, animals bioluminesce to match the glow. Predators or prey looking up from below are deceived by this camoflauge, unable to see the creatures silhouette. Such otherworldly adaptations also arise from the need to locate and snatch up food before it drifts away. Some sea animals, like jellyfish, comb jellies and salps can migrate between depths partially because their 90% water consistency allows them to withstand immense pressure. But they're the exception. Most deep-sea creatures are confined to a narrow range in the water column where nutrients are scarce since the food drifting downwards from the surface rapidly sinks to the sea floor. Plunging all the way down, we find more exotic creatures. Some take on dwarfism, a trait that transforms them  into miniature versions of animals we see closer to the surface. It's thought that reduced food availability causes the shrinkage. Only a tiny fraction of the food produced at the surface reaches the sea floor, so being small gives animals a low energy requirement and an adaptive advantage. And yet, the sea is also the land of giants. Here, gargantuan squids can reach 18 meters long. Isopods scuttle around the sea floor like enormous wood lice. There are long-limbed  Japanese spider crabs, and oarfish, whose bodies stretch to 15 meters. This trait is known as gigantism, and it's something of a mystery. It's thought that high oxygen levels may drive extreme growth in some species, while the colder temperatures promote longer life spans, giving animals the opportunity  to grow massive. Many of these exotic sea beasts will never experience sunlight. Some will venture up through the water column to feed, and a few will actually break the waves, reminding us at the surface about the incredible survival skills of the ocean's deepest inhabitants. Humans still have an astounding 95% of the ocean left to explore. So those depths remain a great mystery. What other untold wonders lie far below, and which ones will we discover next? "
369,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,URuMb15CWJs,"Just for a moment, focus on your breath. In slowly. Out slowly. In slowly. Out. The same pattern repeats within every one of us and consider your pulse. The beat is built into the very fabric of our being. Simply put, we're creatures of rhythm and repetition. It's central to our experience, rhythm and repetition, rhythm and repetition. On, and in, and on, and out. And we delight in those aspects everyday, in the rhythm of a song, the beat of the drum, the nod of your head, or in the repetition of soup cans, the rows of an orchard, the artistry of petals. Pattern can be pleasure. In language, rhythm and repetition are often used as the building blocks for poetry. There's the rhythm of language, created by syllables and their emphasis, such as, ""So long as men can breathe or eyes can see."" And there's the repetition of language at multiple levels: the repetition of letters, ""So long lives this and this gives life to thee,"" of sounds, ""breathe,"" ""see,"" ""thee,"" and of words. With so many uses, repetition is one of the poet's most malleable and reliable tools. It can lift or lull the listener, amplify or diminish the line, unify or diversify ideas. In fact, even rhythm itself, a repeated pattern of stressed syllables, is a form of repetition. Yet for all its varied uses, too much repetition can backfire. Imagine writing the same sentence on the blackboard twenty times, again, and again, and again, and again, or imagine a young child clamoring for her mother's attention, ""Mom, mom, mommy, mom, mom."" Not exactly what we might call poetry. So what is poetic repetition, and why does it work? Possibly most familiar is rhyme, the repetition of like sounds in word endings. As with Shakespeare's example, we often encounter rhyme at the ends of lines. Repetition in this way creates an expectation. We begin to listen for the repetition of those similar sounds. When we hear them,  the found pattern is pleasurable. Like finding Waldo in the visual chaos, we hear the echo in the oral chatter. Yet, rhyme need not surface solely at a line's end. Notice the strong ""i"" sound in, ""So long lives this and this gives life to thee."" This repetition of vowel sounds is called assonance and can also be heard  in Eminem's ""Lose Yourself."" Notice how the ""e"" and ""o"" sounds repeat both within in and at the end of each line: ""Oh, there goes gravity, Oh, there goes rabbit, he choked, he so mad but he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes."" The alternating assonance creates its own rhythm, and invites us to try our own voices in echoing it. Similarly, consonance is the repetition of like consonant sounds, such as the ""l"" and ""th"" in, ""So long lives this and this gives life to thee."" In fact, this type of specific consonance, which occurs at the beginning of words may be familiar to you already. It's called alliteration, or front rhyme. Great examples include tongue twisters. Betty bought some butter but the butter was bitter so Betty bought some better butter to make the bitter butter better. Here, the pleasure in pattern is apparent as we trip over the consonance both within words and at their start. Yet tongue twisters also reflect the need for variation in poetic repetition. While challenging to say, they're seen by some as lesser imitations of poetry, or gimmicky because they hammer so heavily on the same sounds, closer to that blackboard-style  of repetition. Ultimately, this is the poet's balancing act, learning when to repeat and when to riff, when to satisfy expectations, and when to thwart them, and in that balance, it may be enough to remember we all live in a world of wild variation and carry with us our own breath and beat, our own repetition wherever we go. "
370,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,UixU1oRW64Q,"How high can you count on your fingers? It seems like a question with an obvious answer. After all, most of us have ten fingers, or to be more precise, eight fingers and two thumbs. This gives us a total of ten digits on our two hands, which we use to count to ten. It's no coincidence that the ten symbols we use in our modern numbering system are called digits as well. But that's not the only way to count. In some places, it's customary to go up to twelve on just one hand. How? Well, each finger is divided into three sections, and we have a natural pointer to indicate each one, the thumb. That gives us an easy to way to count to twelve on one hand. And if we want to count higher, we can use the digits on our other hand to keep track of each time we get to twelve, up to five groups of twelve, or 60. Better yet, let's use the sections on the second hand to count twelve groups of twelve, up to 144. That's a pretty big improvement, but we can go higher by finding more countable parts on each hand. For example, each finger  has three sections and three creases for a total of six things to count. Now we're up to 24 on each hand, and using our other hand to mark groups of 24 gets us all the way to 576. Can we go any higher? It looks like we've reached the limit of how many different finger parts we can count with any precision. So let's think of something different. One of our greatest mathematical inventions is the system of positional notation, where the placement of symbols allows for different magnitudes of value, as in the number 999. Even though the same symbol is used three times, each position indicates a different order of magnitude. So we can use positional value on our fingers to beat our previous record. Let's forget about finger sections for a moment and look at the simplest case of having just two options per finger, up and down. This won't allow us to represent  powers of ten, but it's perfect for the counting system that uses powers of two, otherwise known as binary. In binary, each position has double the value of the previous one, so we can assign  our fingers values of one, two, four, eight, all the way up to 512. And any positive integer, up to a certain limit, can be expressed  as a sum of these numbers. For example, the number seven is 4+2+1. so we can represent it by having just these three fingers raised. Meanwhile, 250 is 128+64+32+16+8+2. How high an we go now? That would be the number with all ten fingers raised, or 1,023. Is it possible to go even higher? It depends on how dexterous you feel. If you can bend each finger just halfway, that gives us three different states - down, half bent, and raised. Now, we can count using  a base-three positional system, up to 59,048. And if you can bend your fingers into four different states or more, you can get even higher. That limit is up to you, and your own flexibility and ingenuity. Even with our fingers in just two possible states, we're already working pretty efficiently. In fact, our computers are based on the same principle. Each microchip consists of tiny electrical switches that can be either on or off, meaning that base-two is the default way they represent numbers. And just as we can use this system to count past 1,000 using only our fingers, computers can perform billions of operations just by counting off 1's and 0's. "

He had three promising students: Moni Mekhala, the brilliant goddess of the seas, Vorachhun, the princely manifestation of the earth, and Ream Eyso, a demon whose heart burned with passionate fire. Lok Ta wished to bestow a gift upon his most deserving student. To determine which of the three that was, he announced a contest: whoever first brought back  a glass full of morning dew would be master of this mysterious gift. When dusk came, Vorachhun and Ream Eyso ventured into the forest. They left not one leaf or blade of grass untouched, impatiently shaking the precious fluid into their glasses. When they returned to the hermit’s hut, they found Moni Mekhala sitting patiently  with a full glass of morning dew. She had left her shawl out overnight and won the contest by simply wringing out the fabric over her glass. Proud of all his students, and loving them like his own children, Lok Ta surprised all three with gifts. He turned the dew Ream Eyso  collected into a diamond axe, Vorachhun’s into a magic dagger, and Moni Mekhala’s into a crystal ball unlike anything ever seen. Soon Ream Eyso grew covetous and decided he must have Mekhala’s prize. He and Vorachhun tried to woo the goddess so they could get the precious gem. But after she rejected their advances  and flew off, Ream Eyso resolved to take the crystal ball by force. Ream Eyso flew through the air in search of Moni Mekhala, propelled on by a jealous rage. On his way, he encountered Vorachhun  and attacked him, knowing that the righteous prince would never allow him to steal the crystal. The demon gained the upper hand  in the heat of battle, and hurled Vorachhun against the side of a mountain. Sure of Vorachhun’s death, Ream Eyso continued his search until he finally found Moni Mekhala. He demanded that she  and her friends either submit to him, the most brilliant of Lok Ta’s students and rightful master of the crystal ball, or die like Vorachhun. Mekhala, without fear,  refused and flew off into the clouds, hoping to draw the demon away from her friends. Ream Eyso took the bait, ripping through nimbus after nimbus in his crazed pursuit. Once far enough away, Mekhala confronted her pursuer. Ream Eyso made one last demand but the goddess remained unfazed. Enraged, he began  to swing his diamond axe. Before he could hurl the weapon, Mekhala threw her crystal into the air. As it climbed the height of the sky, it emitted powerful flashes of lightning that blinded the demon. Ream Eyso let his axe loose in wild desperation. As the weapon flew through the air  it cut through clouds, creating deep, rolling peals of thunder. And when the lightning and thunder mixed, precious seeds of water fell from heaven: rain. Mekhala drew close to Ream Eyso, now blind and impotent without his axe. She pondered what she should do to the murderer. Remembering the kindness and love of her teacher, Moni Mekhala chose compassion  and flew into the sky. Shortly later, Ream Eyso regained his strength, found his axe, and followed her. Thunder, lightning, and rain continued  to dance across the earth. Some drops fell on Vorachhun and revived him, his skin golden like a rice field ready for harvest. Grabbing his magic dagger, he flew into the sky in search  of Ream Eyso and Moni Mekhala. "

These are the oldest trees, with hundreds of children and  thousands of grandchildren. They check in with their neighbors,  sharing food, supplies, and wisdom gained over their long lives. They do all this rooted in place, unable  to speak, reach out, or move around. The secret to their success lies  under the forest floor, where vast root systems support the  towering trunks above. Partnering with these roots are symbiotic  fungi called mycorrhizae. These fungi have countless branching,  thread-like hyphae that together make up the mycelium. The mycelium spreads across a much larger area than the tree root system and connect the roots of different trees together. These connections form  mycorrhizal networks. Through mycorrhizal networks, fungi can pass resources and signaling molecules between trees. We know the oldest trees have the largest mycorrhizal networks with the most connections to other trees, but these connections are incredibly  complicated to trace. That’s because there are about a hundred  species of mycorrhizal fungi– and an individual tree might be colonized by dozens of different fungal organisms, each of which connects to a unique set of other trees, which in turn each have their own unique set of fungal associations. To get a sense of how substances flow through this network, let’s zoom in on sugars, as they travel from a mature tree to a  neighboring seedling. Sugar’s journey starts high above  the ground, in the leaves of the tallest trees  above the canopy. The leaves use the ample sunlight up there to create sugars through photosynthesis. This essential fuel then travels through the tree to the base of the trunk in the thick sap. From there, sugar flows down to the roots. Mycorrhizal fungi encounter the tips of the roots and either surround or penetrate  the outer root cells, depending on the type of fungi. Fungi cannot produce sugars, though they need them for fuel just like trees do. They can, however, collect nutrients from the soil much  more efficiently than tree roots— and pass these nutrients into  the tree roots. In general, substances flow from where they are more abundant to where they are less abundant, or from source to sink. That means that the sugars flow from the  tree roots into the fungal hyphae. Once the sugars enter the fungus, they travel along the hyphae through pores between cells or through special hollow  transporter hyphae. The fungus absorbs some of the sugars, but some travels on and enters the roots of a neighboring tree, a seedling that grows in the shade and has less opportunity to photosynthesize sugars. But why does fungus transport resources  from tree to tree? This is one of the mysteries of the  mycorrhizal networks. It makes sense for fungus to exchange soil nutrients and sugar with a tree— both parties benefit. The fungus likely benefits in less obvious ways from being part of a network between trees, but the exact ways aren’t totally clear. Maybe the fungus benefits from  having connections with as many different trees as possible, and maximizes its connections by shuttling molecules between trees. Or maybe plants reduce their  contributions to fungi if the fungi don’t facilitate exchanges  between trees. Whatever the reasons, these fungi pass an incredible amount  of information between trees. Through the mycorrhizae, trees can tell  when nutrients or signaling molecules are coming from a member of their  own species or not. They can even tell when information is  coming from a close relative like a sibling or parent. Trees can also share information about events like drought or insect attacks through their  fungal networks, causing their neighbors to increase  production of protective enzymes in anticipation of threats. The forest’s health relies on these intricate communications and exchanges. With everything so deeply interconnected, what impacts one species is bound to impact others. "
374,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,VVL-8zr2hk4,"Each time you take a step, 200 muscles work in unison to lift your foot, propel it forward, and set it down. It's just one of the many thousands of tasks performed by the muscular system. This network of over 650 muscles covers the body and is the reason we can blink, smile, run, jump, and stand upright. It's even responsible for  the heart's dependable thump. First, what exactly  is the muscular system? It's made up of three main muscle types: skeletal muscle, which attaches via tendons to our bones, cardiac muscle, which is only found in the heart, and smooth muscle, which lines the blood vessels and certain organs, like the intestine and uterus. All three types are  made up of muscle cells, also known as fibers, bundled tightly together. These bundles receive signals from the nervous system that contract the fibers, which in turn generates force and motion. This produces almost all the movements we make. Some of the only parts of the body whose motions aren't governed by the muscular system are sperm cells, the hair-like cilia in our airways, and certain white blood cells. Muscle contraction can be split into three main types. The first two, shortening muscle fibers and lengthening them, generate opposing forces. So the biceps will shorten while the triceps will lengthen or relax, pulling up the arm and making it bend at the elbow. This allows us to, say, pick up a book, or if the muscle relationship  is reversed, put it down. This complementary partnership exists throughout the muscular system. The third type of contraction creates a stabilizing force. In these cases, the muscle fibers don't change in length, but instead keep the muscles rigid. This allows us to grip a mug of coffee or lean against a wall. It also maintains our posture by holding us upright. Skeletal muscles form the bulk of the muscular system, make up about 30-40% of the body's weight, and generate most of its motion. Some muscles are familiar to us, like the pectorals and the biceps. Others may be less so, like the buccinator, a muscle that attaches your cheek to your teeth, or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle, a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment called the stapedius that's nestled deep inside the ear. Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are connected to the somatic nervous system, which gives us almost complete control over their movements. This muscle group also contains two types of muscle fibers to refine our motions even further, slow-twitch and fast-twitch. Fast-twitch fibers react instantly when triggered but quickly use up their energy and tire out. Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand, are endurance cells. They react and use energy slowly so they can work for longer periods. A sprinter will accumulate more fast-twitch muscles in her legs through continuous practice, enabling her to quickly, if briefly, pick up the pace, whereas back muscles contain  more slow-twitch muscles to maintain your posture all day. Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's cardiac and smooth muscles are managed by  the autonomic nervous system beyond our direct control. That makes your heart thump roughly 3 billion times over the course of your life, which supplies the body  with blood and oxygen. Autonomic control also contracts and relaxes smooth muscle in a rhythmic cycle. That pumps blood through the smooth internal walls of blood vessels, enables the intestine to constrict and push food through the digestive system, and allows the uterus to contract when a person is giving birth. As muscles work, they also use energy and produce an important byproduct, heat. In fact, muscle provides  about 85% of your warmth, which the heart and blood vessels then spread evenly across the body via the blood. Without that, we couldn't maintain the temperature necessary for our survival. The muscular system  may be largely invisible to us, but it leaves its mark on almost everything we do, whether it's the blink of an eye or a race to the finish line. "
375,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,VdHHus8IgYA,"Thousands of years in the making, what began as part of a religious festival honoring the Greek god Zeus in the rural Greek town of Olympia has today become the greatest show of sporting excellence on Earth. The inception date in 776 BC became the basis for the Greek's earliest calendar, where time was marked in four-year increments called olympiads. What could it be? Why, it's the Olympic games, of course. Competition fosters excellence, or so thought the Ancient Greeks. In addition to sporting events, contests were held for music,  singing, and poetry. You can read about them all yourself in classical literary works, like Homer's ""Iliad""  and Virgil's ""Aeneid."" Even mythical heroes appreciate a good contest every now and then, wouldn't you say? For the first thirteen games, the Ancient Greek Olympics featured just one event, the two hundred yard dash. But over time, new exciting contests, like boxing, chariot and mule racing, and even a footrace where the competitors wore a full suit of armor enticed many hopeful champions into the Olympic stadium. The combined running, jumping, wrestling, javelin throwing, and hurling the discus events known as the pentathlon inspired world-class competition, and the pankration, a no holds barred fight where only biting and eye-gouging were prohibited, ensured the toughest men were victorious. And victorious they were. Nobody tops the local baker Coroebus, who 776 BC became the very first Olympic champion. And we'll never forget Orsippus of Megara, the 720 BC Olympic victor tore away his loincloth so he could race unimpeded, inaugurating the Ancient Greek tradition of competing in the nude. Now there's a winning streak, if ever we've seen one. But all good things must end. In 391 AD, the Christian Roman Emperor Theodosius banned pagan practices, so the world soon bid a fond farewell to the Olympic games. But just like those early  pankration athletes, you can't keep a good one down, and 1500 years later in 1896, the modern Olympic games kicked off in Athens, Greece. Today, the Summer and Winter Olympics bring international world-class athletes together by the thousands, uniting fans by the billions for the world's foremost sporting competition. Citius, Altius, Fortius. Three cheers for the Olympics. "
376,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,VdZd5zYTKAw,"It was the dawn of 1863, and London’s  not-yet-opened subway system, the first of its kind in the world,  had the city in an uproar. Digging a hole under the city  and putting a railroad in it seemed the stuff of dreams. Pub drinkers scoffed at the idea and a local minister accused the railway company of trying to break into hell. Most people simply thought the project, which cost more than 100 million dollars in today’s money, would never work. But it did. On January 10, 1863, 30,000 people ventured underground to travel on the world’s first subway on a four-mile stretch of line in London. After three years of construction and a few setbacks, the Metropolitan Railway was ready for business. The city’s officials were much relieved. They’d been desperate to find a way to reduce the terrible congestion on the roads. London, at the time the world’s largest and most prosperous city, was in a permanent state of gridlock, with carts, costermongers, cows, and commuters jamming the roads. It’d been a Victorian visionary,  Charles Pearson, who first thought of putting railways  under the ground. He’d lobbied for underground trains  throughout the 1840s, but opponents thought the idea was impractical since the railroads at the time only had short tunnels under hills. How could you get a railway through the center of a city? The answer was a simple system called ""cut and cover."" Workers had to dig a huge trench, construct a tunnel out of brick archways, and then refill the hole over the newly built tunnel. Because this was disruptive and required the demolition  of buildings above the tunnels, most of the line went under existing roads. Of course, there were accidents. On one occasion, a heavy rainstorm  flooded the nearby sewers and burst through the excavation, delaying the project by several months. But as soon as  the Metropolitan Railway opened, Londoners rushed in to ride the new trains. The Metropolitan quickly became a vital part of London’s transport system. Additional lines were soon built, and new suburbs grew around the stations. Big department stores opened next to the railroad, and the railway company  even created attractions, like a 30-story Ferris wheel in Earls Court to bring in tourists by train. Within 30 years, London’s subway system covered  80 kilometers, with lines in the center of town running in tunnels, and suburban trains operating  on the surface, often on embankments. But London was still growing, and everyone wanted to be connected to the system. By the late 1880s, the city had become too dense with buildings, sewers, and electric cables for the ""cut and cover"" technique, so a new system had to be devised. Using a machine  called the Greathead Shield, a team of just 12 workers could bore through the earth, carving deep underground tunnels through the London clay. These new lines, called tubes, were at varying depths, but usually about 25 meters deeper than  the ""cut and cover"" lines. This meant their construction  didn’t disturb the surface, and it was possible to dig under buildings. The first tube line,  the City and South London, opened in 1890 and proved so successful that half a dozen more lines were built in the next 20 years. This clever new technology was even used to burrow several lines under London’s river, the Thames. By the early 20th century, Budapest, Berlin, Paris, and New York had all built subways of their own. And today, with more than 160 cities in 55 countries using underground rails  to combat congestion, we can thank Charles Pearson and the Metropolitan Railway for getting us started on the right track.

377,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,VjO55pKuBo4,"As far as we know, Medieval England was never invaded by ice zombies, or terrorized by dragons, but it was shaken by a power struggle between two noble families spanning generations and involving a massive cast of characters with complex motives  and shifting loyalties. If that sounds familiar, it's because the historical conflicts known as the Wars of the Roses served as the basis for much of the drama in Game of Thrones. The real-life seeds of war were sewn by the death of King Edward III in 1377. Edward's oldest son had died before his father, but his ten-year-old son, Richard II, succeeded to the throne  ahead of Edward's three surviving sons. This skipping of an entire generation left lingering claims to the throne among their various offspring, particularly the Lancasters, descended from Edward's third son, and the Yorks, descended from his fourth son. The name of the ensuing wars comes from the symbols associated with the two families, the white rose of York and the red rose of Lancaster. The Lancasters first gained the throne when Richard II was deposed  by his cousin Henry IV in 1399. Despite sporadic unrest, their reign remained secure until 1422, when Henry V's death  in a military campaign left an infant Henry VI as king. Weak-willed and dominated by advisors, Henry was eventually convinced to marry Margaret of Anjou to gain French support. Margaret was beautiful, ambitious, and ruthless in persecuting  any threat to her power, and she distrusted Richard of York, most of all. York had been the King's close advisor and loyal General, but was increasingly  sidelined by the Queen, who promoted her favorite supporters, like the Earls of Suffolk and Somerset. York's criticism of their inept handling of the war against France led to his exclusion from court and transfer to Ireland. Meanwhile, mounting military failures, and corrupt rule by Margaret and her allies caused widespread discontent, and in the midst of this chaos, Richard of York returned with an army to arrest Somerset and reform the court. Initially unsuccessful,  he soon got his chance when he was appointed Protector of the Realm after Henry suffered a mental breakdown. However, less than a year later, Henry suddendly recovered and the Queen convinced him  to reverse York's reforms. York fled and raised an army once more. Though he was unable to directly seize the throne, he managed to be reinstated as Protector and have himself and his heirs designated to succeed Henry. But instead of a crown, York's head acquired a pike after he was killed in battle with the Queen's loyalists. His young son took up the claim and was crowned Edward IV. Edward enjoyed great military success against the Lancasters. Henry was captured, while Margaret fled into exile with their reportedly cruel son,  Edward of Westminster. But the newly crowned King made a tragic political mistake by backing out of his arranged marriage with a French Princess to secretly marry the widow of a minor Noble. This alienated his most powerful ally, the Earl of Warwick. Warwick allied with the Lancasters, turned Edward's jealous younger brother, George, against him, and even briefly managed to restore Henry as King, but it didn't last. Edward recaptured the throne, the Lancaster Prince was killed in battle, and Henry himself died in captivity not long after. The rest of Edward IV's reign  was peaceful, but upon his death in 1483,  the bloodshed resumed. Though his twelve-year-old son was due to succeed him, Edward's younger brother Richard III declared his nephews illegitimate due to their father's secret marriage. He assumed the regency himself and threw the boys in prison. Though no one knows what ultimately became of them, after a while, the Princes disappeared and Richard's power seemed secure. But his downfall would come only two years later from across the narrow sea of the English Channel. Henry Tudor was a direct descendant of the first Duke of Lancaster, raised in exile after his father's  death in a previous rebellion. With Richard III's power grab causing a split in the York faction, Henry won support for his royal claim. Raising an army in France, he crossed the Channel in 1485 and quickly defeated Richard's forces. And by marrying Elizabeth of York, elder sister of the disappeared Princes, the newly crowned Henry VII joined the two roses, finally ending nearly a century of war. We often think of historical wars as decisive conflicts with clearly defined winners and losers. But the Wars of the Roses, like the fiction they inspired, show us that victories can be uncertain, alliances unstable, and even the power of Kings as fleeting as the seasons. "

From outlawed religious tracts and revolutionary manifestos to censored and burned books, we know the potential power of words to overturn the social order. But as strange as it may seem, some numbers have also been considered dangerous enough to ban. Our distant ancestors long counted objects using simple tally marks. But as they developed agriculture and began living together in larger groups, this was no longer enough. As numbers grew more complex, people began not just using them, but thinking about what they are and how they work. And by 600 B.C.E. in Ancient Greece, the study of numbers was well-developed. The mathematician Pythagoras and his school of followers found numerical patterns in shapes, music, and the stars. For them, mathematics held  the deepest secrets of the universe. But one Pythagorean named Hippasus discovered something disturbing. Some quantities, like the diagonal of a square with sides of length one couldn't be expressed by any combination of whole numbers or fractions, no matter how small. These numbers,  which we call irrational numbers, were perceived as a threat to the Pythagorean's notion  of a perfect universe. They imagined a reality  that could be described with rational, numerical patterns. Historians write that Hippasus was exhiled for publicizing his findings, while legends claim he was drowned as punishment from the gods. While irrational numbers  upset philosophers, later mathematical inventions would draw attention from political and religious authorities, as well. In the Middle Ages, while Europe was still using Roman numerals, other cultures had developed  positional systems that included a symbol for zero. When Arab travelers brought this system to the bustling maritime cities of Italy, its advantages for merchants and bankers was clear. But the authorities were more wary. Hindu-Arabic numerals were considered easier to forge or alter, especially since they were less familiar to customers than to merchants. And the concept of zero opened  the door to negative numbers and the recording of debt at a time when moneylending was regarded with suspicion. In the 13th century, Florence banned the use of Hindu-Arabic numerals for record keeping. And though they soon proved too useful to ignore, controversies over zero  and negative numbers continued for a long time. Negative numbers  were dismissed as absurd well into the 19th century. And prominent mathematicians, like Gerolamo Cardano, avoided using zero, even though it would have made it much easier to find solutions to cubic and the quartic equations. Even today it's illegal to use some numbers for different reasons. Some are banned because of what they represent. For example, governments have prohibited the display of numbers that have symbolic meaning, such as the date of a revolution or connections to oppositional political figures or parties. Other numbers are potentially illegal because of the information they carry. Just about any information, whether text, image, video, or executable programs can be translated into a string of numbers. But this means that protected information, whether copyrights, proprietary materials, or state secrets can also be represented as numbers, so possessing or publishing these numbers may be treated as a criminal offense. This idea gathered attention in 2001 when code that could be used to decrypt DVDs was widely shared and distributed in the form of a large prime number. The idea of illegal numbers may sound absurd, but like words, written numbers are a way of expressing concepts and information. And in a world where calculations and algorithms shape more and more of our lives, the mathematician's pencil grows stronger by the day. "
379,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Vtkv3-endYc,"What drives someone to kill in cold blood? What goes through the murderer’s mind? And what kind of a society breeds such people? Over 150 years ago Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky took these questions up in what would become one of the best-known works of Russian literature: ""Crime and Punishment."" First serialized in a literary  magazine in 1866, the novel tells the story of Rodion  Romanovich Raskolnikov, a young law student in Saint Petersburg. Raskolnikov lives in abject poverty, and at the start of the story has run  out of funds to continue his studies. Letters from his rural home  only add to his distress when he realizes how much his mother and sister have sacrificed for his success. Increasingly desperate after selling the last of his valuables to an elderly pawnbroker, he resolves on a plan  to murder and rob her. But the impact of carrying out this unthinkable act proves to be more than  he was prepared for. Though the novel is sometimes cited as one of the first psychological thrillers, its scope reaches far beyond  Raskolnikov’s inner turmoil. From dank taverns to dilapidated  apartments and claustrophobic police stations, the underbelly of 19th century Saint  Petersburg is brought to life by Dostoyevsky’s searing prose. We’re introduced to characters such as Marmeladov, a miserable former official who has drank his family into ruin, and Svidrigailov, an unhinged and lecherous nobleman. As Raskolnikov’s own family  arrives in town, their moral innocence stands  in stark contrast to the depravity of those around them, even as their fates grow increasingly intertwined. This bleak portrait of Russian society reflects the author’s own complex life  experiences and evolving ideas. As a young writer who left behind  a promising military career, Fyodor had been attracted to  ideas of socialism and reform, and joined a circle of intellectuals to  discuss radical texts banned by the Imperial government. Upon exposure, members of this group, including  Dostoyevsky, were arrested. Many were sentenced to death, only to be subjected to a mock execution and last-minute pardon from the Tsar. Dostoyevsky spent the next four years in a Siberian labor camp before being released in 1854. The experience left him with a far  more pessimistic view of social reform, and his focus shifted toward  spiritual concerns. In the 1864 novella ""Notes from  Underground,"" he expounded on his belief that utopian Western philosophies could never satisfy the contradictory  yearnings of the human soul. ""Crime and Punishment"" was conceived  and completed the following year, picking up on many of the same themes. In many ways, the novel follows a common narrative thread where a promising youth is seduced and corrupted by the dangers of urban life. But its social critique cuts far deeper. Raskolnikov rationalizes that  his own advancement at the cost of the exploitative  pawnbroker’s death would be a net benefit to society. In doing so, he echoes the doctrines of egoism  and utilitarianism embraced by many of Dostoyevsky’s  contemporary intellectuals. And in believing that his intelligence  allows him to transcend moral taboos, Raskolnikov cuts himself off from  his own humanity. Yet although the book is deeply  concerned with morality, ""Crime and Punishment"" never comes across as merely moralizing, with each character given their own  distinctive and convincing voice. One of the most remarkable things about ""Crime and Punishment"" is its ability to thrill despite the details of the central murder being revealed in the first act. Raskolnikov’s crime is clear. But it’s only through Dostoyevsky’s  gripping account of the ensuing social and psychological turmoil that we learn the true nature  of his punishment– and the possibility of redemption. "
380,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,W0GpIMNTPYg,"The biggest kidney stone on record weighed more than a kilogram and was 17 centimeters in diameter. The patient didn't actually swallow a stone the size of a coconut. Kidney stones form inside the body, but unfortunately, they're extremely painful to get out. A kidney stone is a hard mass of crystals that can form in the kidneys, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Urine contains compounds  that consist of calcium, sodium, potassium, oxalate, uric acid, and phosphate. If the levels of these particles get too high, or if urine becomes too acidic or basic, the particles can clump together and crystallize. Unless the problem is addressed, the crystals will gradually grow over a few weeks, months, or even years, forming a detectable stone. Calcium oxalate is the most common type of crystal to form this way, and accounts for about  80% of kidney stones. Less common kidney stones are made of calcium phosphate, or uric acid. A slightly different type of stone made of the minerals magnesium ammonium phosphate, or struvite, can be caused by bacterial infection. And even rarer stones can result from genetic disorders or certain medications. A kidney stone can go undetected until it starts to move. When a stone travels through the kidney and into the ureter, its sharp edges scratch the walls of the urinary tract. Nerve endings embedded in this tissue transmit excruciating pain signals through the nervous system. And the scratches can send blood flowing into the urine. This can be accompanied  by symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation while urinating. If a stone gets big enough to actually block the flow of urine, it can create an infection, or back flow, and damage the kidneys themselves. But most kidney stones don't become this serious, or even require invasive treatment. Masses less than five millimeters in diameter will usually pass out of the body on their own. A doctor will often simply recommend drinking large amounts of water to help speed the process along, and maybe taking some pain killers. If the stone is slightly larger, medications like alpha blockers can help by relaxing the muscles in the ureter and making it easier  for the stone to get through. Another medication called potassium citrate can help dissolve the stones by creating a less acidic urine. For medium-sized stones up to about ten millimeters, one option is pulverizing them with soundwaves. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy uses high-intensity pulses of focused ultrasonic energy aimed directly at the stone. The pulses create vibrations inside the stone itself and small bubbles jostle it. These combined forces crush the stone into smaller pieces that can pass out of the body more easily. But zapping a stone with sound doesn't work as well if it's simply too big. So sometimes, more invasive treatments are necessary. A rigid tube called a stent can be placed in the ureter to expand it. Optical fibers can deliver laser pulses to break up the stone. Stones can also be surgically removed through an incision in the patient's back or groin. What about just avoiding kidney stones in the first place? For people prone to them, their doctor may recommend drinking plenty of water, which dilutes the calcium oxalate and other compounds that eventually build up  into painful stones. Foods like potato chips, spinach, rhubarb, and beets are high in oxalate, so doctors might advise limiting them. Even though calcium  is often found in stones, calcium in foods and beverages can actually help by binding to oxalate  in the digestive tract before it can be absorbed and reach the kidneys. If you do end up with a kidney stone, you're not alone. Data suggests that rates are rising, but that world record probably won't be broken any time soon. "

They’re in physics labs: clouds of gases held just fractions of a degree above absolute zero. That’s 395 million times colder than your refrigerator, 100 million times colder  than liquid nitrogen, and 4 million times colder than outer space. Temperatures this low give scientists a window into the inner workings of matter, and allow engineers to build incredibly sensitive instruments that tell us more about everything from our exact position on the planet to what’s happening in the farthest reaches of the universe. How do we create such extreme temperatures? In short, by slowing down  moving particles. When we’re talking about temperature, what we’re really talking about is motion. The atoms that make up solids, liquids, and gases are moving all the time. When atoms are moving more rapidly, we perceive that matter as hot. When they’re moving more slowly, we perceive it as cold. To make a hot object or gas cold in everyday life, we place it in a colder environment, like a refrigerator. Some of the atomic motion in the hot object is transferred to the surroundings, and it cools down. But there’s a limit to this: even outer space is too warm to create ultra-low temperatures. So instead, scientists figured out a way to slow the atoms down directly – with a laser beam. Under most circumstances, the energy in a laser beam  heats things up. But used in a very precise way, the beam’s momentum can stall  moving atoms, cooling them down. That’s what happens in a device  called a magneto-optical trap. Atoms are injected into a vacuum chamber, and a magnetic field draws them towards the center. A laser beam aimed  at the middle of the chamber is tuned to just the right frequency that an atom moving towards it will absorb a photon of the laser beam and slow down. The slow down effect comes from the transfer of momentum between the atom and the photon. A total of six beams, in a perpendicular arrangement, ensure that atoms traveling in all directions will be intercepted. At the center, where the beams intersect, the atoms move sluggishly,  as if trapped in a thick liquid — an effect the researchers who invented it  described as “optical molasses.” A magneto-optical trap like this can cool atoms down to just a few microkelvins — about -273 degrees Celsius. This technique was developed in the 1980s, and the scientists who'd contributed to it won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for the discovery. Since then, laser cooling has been improved to reach even lower temperatures. But why would you want to cool atoms down that much? First of all, cold atoms can make very good detectors. With so little energy, they’re incredibly sensitive to fluctuations in the environment. So they’re used in devices that find underground oil and mineral deposits, and they also make highly accurate atomic clocks, like the ones used in global positioning satellites. Secondly, cold atoms hold  enormous potential for probing the frontiers of physics. Their extreme sensitivity makes them candidates to be used to detect gravitational waves in future space-based detectors. They’re also useful for the study of atomic and subatomic phenomena, which requires measuring incredibly tiny fluctuations in the energy of atoms. Those are drowned out at normal temperatures, when atoms speed around at hundreds of meters per second. Laser cooling can slow atoms to just a few centimeters per second— enough for the motion caused by atomic quantum effects to become obvious. Ultracold atoms have already allowed scientists to study phenomena like Bose-Einstein condensation, in which atoms are cooled almost  to absolute zero and become a rare new state of matter. So as researchers continue in their quest  to understand the laws of physics and unravel the mysteries of the universe, they’ll do so with the help of the very coldest atoms in it. "
382,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,WW4skW6gucU,"If you've got a cold,  mucus is hard to miss. But what is it, and what does it do besides making you miserable? Your body produces more than a liter of mucus every day, and all the wet surfaces of your body that are not covered by skin, like your eyes, nose, mouth, lungs, and stomach get a liberal coating. That's why they're known  as mucus membranes. Mucus plays lots of roles in your body. It keeps delicate tissues  from drying out and cracking, which would expose them to infection. It lubricates your eyes so you can blink. It protects your stomach lining from acid. It neutralizes threats by removing or trapping substances that could make you sick. And finally, it houses and keeps your body's trillions of bacterial inhabitants, your microbiota, under control. Mucus contains lots  of different compounds, including proteins, fats, and salts. But a key component of mucus versatility is a set of proteins called mucins. Mucins are the primary large molecules in mucus and are essential  for giving mucus its slippery feel. They belong to a class of proteins called glycoproteins which are built out of both amino acids and sugars. In mucin, long chains of sugars are attached to specific amino acids in the protein backbone. The hydrophilic sugar chains help mucin dissolve in your body's watery fluids. Mucus, which is up to 90% water, stays hydrated thanks  to these sugar chains. Some of these mucins can interact with other mucin molecules to create a complex network that establishes a barrier against pathogens and other invaders. That's why mucus is the body's first line of defense against foreign objects, like bacteria and dust. It's continuously produced to clear them from the respiratory tract, like a slimy conveyor belt. This keeps bacteria from getting a solid purchase on delicate lung tissue, or making it to the blood stream, where they could cause a major infection. Many of those harmful bacteria also cause diseases when they cluster into slimy growths called biofilms. But mucus contains mucins, antimicrobial peptides, antibodies, and even bacteria-hungry viruses called bacteriophages that all work together to prevent biofilms from forming. If microbes do become harmful  and you get sick, the body ramps up mucus production to try to quickly flush out the offenders, and the immune system floods your mucus with extra white blood cells. In fact, the greenish mucus often associated with infections gets its color from an enzyme produced by those white blood cells. This multi-pronged approach  to bacterial management is one of the main reasons why we're not sick all the time. Even though mucus protects against the infectious bacteria, the vast majority of your body's bacterial tenants are not harmful, and many are actually beneficial. That's particularly true  when they live in mucus, where they can perform important functions, like synthesizing vitamins, suppressing harmful inflammation, and controlling the growth of more harmful species. So even though you probably associate mucus with being ill, it's really helping you stay healthy. Sure, it might seem gross, but can you think of any other substance that can lubricate, keep your body clean, fight infection, and domesticate a teeming  bacterial population? Nope, just mucus. "
383,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,WYQ3O8U6SMY,"In the winter of 1995, scientists pointed the Hubble Telescope at an area of the sky near the Big Dipper, a spot that was dark and out of the way of light pollution from surrounding stars. The location was apparently empty, and the whole endeavor was risky. What, if anything, was going to show up? Over ten consecutive days, the telescope took close to 150 hours of exposure of that same area. And what came back was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 distinct galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver  of the universe. Now, let's take a step back to understand the scale of this image. If you were to take a ballpoint pen and hold it at arm's length in front of the night sky, focusing on its very tip, that is what the Hubble Telescope captured in its first Deep Field image. In other words, those 3,000 galaxies were seen in just a tiny speck of the universe, approximately one two-millionth of the night sky. To put all this in perspective, the average human measures about 1.7 meters. With Earth's diameter  at 12,700 kilometers, that's nearly 7.5 million humans lined up head to toe. The Apollo 8 astronauts flew a distance of 380,000 kilometers to the moon. And our relatively small Sun has a diameter of about 1.4 million kilometers, or 110 times the Earth's diameter. A step further, the Milky Way holds somewhere  between 100 to 400 billion stars, including our Sun. And each glowing dot of a galaxy captured in the Deep Field image contains billions of stars at the very least. Almost a decade after taking the Deep Field image, scientists adjusted the optics on the Hubble Telescope and took another long exposure over a period of about four months. This time, they observed 10,000 galaxies. Half of these galaxies have since been analyzed more clearly in what's known as  the eXtreme Deep Field image, or XDF. By combining over ten years  of photographs, the XDF shows galaxies so distant that they're only  one ten-billionth the brightness that the human eye can perceive. So, what can we learn about the universe from the Deep Field images? In a study of the universe, space and time are inextricably linked. That's because of  the finite speed of light. So the Deep Field images are like time machines to the ancient universe. They reach so far into space and time that we can observe galaxies that existed over 13 billion years ago. This means we're looking at the universe as it was less than a billion years  after the Big Bang, and it allows scientists to research galaxies in their infancy. The Deep Field images have also shown that the universe is homogeneous. That is, images taken at different spots in the sky look similar. That's incredible when we think about how vast the universe is. Why would we expect it to be the same across such huge distances? On the scale of a galaxy,  let alone the universe, we're smaller than we can readily comprehend, but we do have the capacity to wonder, to question, to explore, to investigate, and to imagine. So the next time you stand gazing up at the night sky, take a moment to think about the enormity of what is beyond your vision, out in the dark spaces between the stars. "
384,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,WaNLJf8xzC4,"You work at the college library. You're in the middle of a quiet afternoon when suddenly a shipment of 1,280 different books arrives. The books have been dropped of in one long straight line, but they're all out of order, and the automatic sorting  system is broken. To make matters worse, classes start tomorrow, which means that first thing in the morning, students will show up in droves looking for these books. How can you get them all sorted in time? One way would be to start at one end of the line with the first pair of books. If the first two books are in order, then leave them as they are. Otherwise, swap them. Then, look at the second and third books, repeat the process, and continue until you reach  the end of the line. At some point, you'll come across the book that should be last, and keep swapping it with every subsequent book, moving it down the line until it reaches the end where it belongs. Then, start from the beginning and repeat the process to get the second to last book in its proper place, and keep going until all books are sorted. This approach is called Bubble Sort. It's simple but slow. You'd make 1,279 comparisons in the first round, then 1,278, and so on, adding up to 818,560 comparisons. If each took just one second, the process would take over nine days. A second strategy would be to start by sorting just the first two books. Then, take the third book and compare it with the book in the second spot. If it belongs before the second book, swap them, then compare it with the book in the first spot, and swap again if needed. Now you've sorted the first three books. Keep adding one book at a time to the sorted sub-line, comparing and swapping the new book with the one before it until it's correctly placed among the books sorted so far. This is called Insertion Sort. Unlike Bubble Sort, it usually doesn't require comparing every pair of books. On average, we'd expect to only need to compare each book to half of the books that came before it. In that case, the total number of comparisons would be 409,280, taking almost five days. You're still doing  way too many comparisons. Here's a better idea. First, pick a random book. Call it the partition and compare it to every other book. Then, divide the line by placing all the books that come before the partition on its left and all the ones that come after it on its right. You've just saved loads of time by not having to compare any of the books on the left to any of the ones  on the right ever again. Now, looking only  at the books on the left, you can again pick a random partition book and separate those books that come before it from those that come after it. You can keep creating sub-partitions like this until you have a bunch of small sub-lines, each of which you'd sort quickly using another strategy, like Insertion Sort. Each round of partitioning requires about 1,280 comparisons. If your partitions are pretty balanced, dividing the books into 128 sub-lines of ten would take about seven rounds, or 8,960 seconds. Sorting these sub-lines would add about 22 seconds each. All in all, this method  known as QuickSort could sort the books in under three and a half hours. But there's a catch. Your partitions could end up lopsided, saving no time at all. Luckily, this rarely happens. That's why QuickSort is one of the most efficient strategies used by programmers today. They use it for things like sorting items in an online store by price, or creating a list of all the gas stations close to a given location sorted by distance. In your case, you're done quick sorting with time to spare. Just another high-stakes day  in the library. "
385,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,WuyPuH9ojCE,"Are you sleeping restlessly, feeling irritable or moody, forgetting little things, and feeling overwhelmed and isolated? Don't worry. We've all been there. You're probably just stressed out. Stress isn't always a bad thing. It can be handy for a burst of extra energy and focus, like when you're playing  a competitive sport, or have to speak in public. But when its continuous, the kind most of us face day in and day out, it actually begins to change your brain. Chronic stress, like being overworked or having arguments at home, can affect brain size, its structure, and how it functions, right down to the level of your genes. Stress begins with something called the hypothalamus pituitary adrenal axis, a series of interactions between endocrine glands in the brain and on the kidney, which controls  your body's reaction to stress. When your brain detects  a stressful situation, your HPA axis is instantly activated and releases a hormone called cortisol, which primes your body for instant action. But high levels of cortisol over long periods of time wreak havoc on your brain. For example, chronic stress increases the activity level and number of neural connections in the amygdala, your brain's fear center. And as levels of cortisol rise, electric signals in your hippocampus, the part of the brain associated with learning, memories, and stress control, deteriorate. The hippocampus also inhibits the activity of the HPA axis, so when it weakens, so does your ability  to control your stress. That's not all, though. Cortisol can literally cause your brain to shrink in size. Too much of it results in the loss of synaptic connections between neurons and the shrinking of your prefrontal cortex, the part of your brain the regulates behaviors like concentration, decision-making, judgement, and social interaction. It also leads to fewer new brain cells being made in the hippocampus. This means chronic stress might make it harder for you to learn and remember things, and also set the stage for more serious mental problems, like depression and eventually Alzheimer's disease. The effects of stress may filter right down to your brain's DNA. An experiment showed that the amount of nurturing  a mother rat provides its newborn baby plays a part in determining how that baby responds to stress later in life. The pups of nurturing moms turned out less sensitive to stress because their brains developed  more cortisol receptors, which stick to cortisol and dampen the stress response. The pups of negligent moms had the opposite outcome, and so became more sensitive to stress throughout life. These are considered epigenetic changes, meaning that they effect  which genes are expressed without directly changing the genetic code. And these changes can be reversed if the moms are swapped. But there's a surprising result. The epigenetic changes caused by one single mother rat were passed down to many generations of rats after her. In other words, the results  of these actions were inheritable. It's not all bad news, though. There are many ways to reverse what cortisol does to your stressed brain. The most powerful weapons are exercise and meditation, which involves breathing deeply and being aware and focused on your surroundings. Both of these activities  decrease your stress and increase the size of the hippocampus, thereby improving your memory. So don't feel defeated  by the pressures of daily life. Get in control of your stress before it takes control of you. "
386,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,X4BmV2t83SM,"How is it that so many  intergalactic species in movies and TV just happen to speak perfect English? The short answer is that no one wants to watch a starship crew spend years compiling an alien dictionary. But to keep things consistent, the creators of Star Trek and other science-fiction worlds have introduced the concept of a universal translator, a portable device that can instantly translate between any languages. So is a universal translator possible in real life? We already have many programs that claim to do just that, taking a word, sentence,  or entire book in one language and translating it into almost any other, whether it's modern English or Ancient Sanskrit. And if translation were just a matter of looking up words in a dictionary, these programs would run circles around humans. The reality, however,  is a bit more complicated. A rule-based translation program uses a lexical database, which includes all the words  you'd find in a dictionary and all grammatical forms they can take, and set of rules to recognize the basic linguistic elements in the input language. For a seemingly simple sentence like, ""The children eat the muffins,"" the program first parses its syntax, or grammatical structure, by identifying the children  as the subject, and the rest of the sentence  as the predicate consisting of a verb ""eat,"" and a direct object ""the muffins."" It then needs to recognize English morphology, or how the language can be broken down into its smallest meaningful units, such as the word muffin and the suffix ""s,"" used to indicate plural. Finally, it needs to understand  the semantics, what the different parts of the sentence actually mean. To translate this sentence properly, the program would refer to a different set of vocabulary and rules for each element of the target language. But this is where it gets tricky. The syntax of some languages allows words to be arranged in any order, while in others, doing so could make the muffin eat the child. Morphology can also pose a problem. Slovene distinguishes between two children and three or more using a dual suffix absent  in many other languages, while Russian's lack of definite articles might leave you wondering whether the children are eating  some particular muffins, or just eat muffins in general. Finally, even when the semantics are technically correct, the program might miss their finer points, such as whether the children  ""mangiano"" the muffins, or ""divorano"" them. Another method is  statistical machine translation, which analyzes a database of books, articles, and documents that have already  been translated by humans. By finding matches between source and translated text that are unlikely to occur by chance, the program can identify corresponding phrases and patterns, and use them for future translations. However, the quality  of this type of translation depends on the size of the initial database and the availability of samples  for certain languages or styles of writing. The difficulty that computers have with the exceptions, irregularities and shades of meaning that seem to come instinctively to humans has led some researchers to believe that our understanding of language is a unique product of our biological brain structure. In fact, one of the most famous fictional universal translators, the Babel fish from ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"", is not a machine at all but a small creature that translates the brain waves and nerve signals of sentient species through a form of telepathy. For now, learning a language the old fashioned way will still give you better results than any currently available computer program. But this is no easy task, and the sheer number  of languages in the world, as well as the increasing interaction between the people who speak them, will only continue to spur greater advances in automatic translation. Perhaps by the time we encounter intergalactic life forms, we'll be able to communicate with them through a tiny gizmo, or we might have to start compiling that dictionary, after all. "
387,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,XMriWTvPXHI,"This may look like a neatly arranged stack of numbers, but it's actually a mathematical treasure trove. Indian mathematicians called it the Staircase of Mount Meru. In Iran, it's the Khayyam Triangle. And in China, it's Yang Hui's Triangle. To much of the Western world, it's known as Pascal's Triangle after French mathematician Blaise Pascal, which seems a bit unfair since he was clearly late to the party, but he still had a lot to contribute. So what is it about this that has so intrigued mathematicians the world over? In short, it's full of patterns and secrets. First and foremost, there's the pattern that generates it. Start with one and imagine invisible zeros on either side of it. Add them together in pairs, and you'll generate the next row. Now, do that again and again. Keep going and you'll wind up  with something like this, though really Pascal's Triangle  goes on infinitely. Now, each row corresponds to what's called the coefficients of a binomial expansion of the form (x+y)^n, where n is the number of the row, and we start counting from zero. So if you make n=2 and expand it, you get (x^2) + 2xy + (y^2). The coefficients,  or numbers in front of the variables, are the same as the numbers in that row of Pascal's Triangle. You'll see the same thing with n=3, which expands to this. So the triangle is a quick and easy way to look up all of these coefficients. But there's much more. For example, add up  the numbers in each row, and you'll get successive powers of two. Or in a given row, treat each number as part of a decimal expansion. In other words, row two is (1x1) + (2x10) + (1x100). You get 121, which is 11^2. And take a look at what happens when you do the same thing to row six. It adds up to 1,771,561, which is 11^6, and so on. There are also geometric applications. Look at the diagonals. The first two aren't very interesting: all ones, and then the positive integers, also known as natural numbers. But the numbers in the next diagonal are called the triangular numbers because if you take that many dots, you can stack them  into equilateral triangles. The next diagonal has the tetrahedral numbers because similarly, you can stack that many spheres into tetrahedra. Or how about this: shade in all of the odd numbers. It doesn't look like much when the triangle's small, but if you add thousands of rows, you get a fractal known as Sierpinski's Triangle. This triangle isn't just a mathematical work of art. It's also quite useful, especially when it comes to probability and calculations in the domain of combinatorics. Say you want to have five children, and would like to know the probability of having your dream family  of three girls and two boys. In the binomial expansion, that corresponds to girl plus boy to the fifth power. So we look at the row five, where the first number  corresponds to five girls, and the last corresponds to five boys. The third number is what we're looking for. Ten out of the sum of all the possibilities in the row. so 10/32, or 31.25%. Or, if you're randomly  picking a five-player basketball team out of a group of twelve friends, how many possible groups  of five are there? In combinatoric terms, this problem would be phrased as twelve choose five, and could be calculated with this formula, or you could just look at the sixth element of row twelve on the triangle and get your answer. The patterns in Pascal's Triangle are a testament to the elegantly interwoven fabric of mathematics. And it's still revealing fresh secrets to this day. For example, mathematicians recently  discovered a way to expand it to these kinds of polynomials. What might we find next? Well, that's up to you. "
388,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Xm13Kq_E1ik,"Suppose you placed a camera at a fixed position, took a picture of the sky at the same time everyday  for an entire year and overlayed all of the photos on top of each other. What would the sun look like in that combined image? A stationary dot? A circular path? Neither. Oddly enough, it makes this figure eight pattern, known as the Sun's analemma, but why? The Earth's movement  creates a few cycles. First of all, it rotates on its axis about once every 24 hours, producing sunrises and sunsets. At the same time, it's making a much slower cycle, orbiting around the sun approximately every 365 days. But there's a twist. Relative to the plane of its orbit, the Earth doesn't spin with the North Pole pointing straight up. Instead, its axis has a constant tilt of 23.4 degrees. This is known as the Earth's axial tilt, or obliquity. A 23-degree tilt may not seem important, but it's the main reason that we experience different seasons. Because the axis remains tilted in the same direction while the Earth makes its annual orbit, there are long periods each year when the northern half of the planet remains tilted toward the Sun while the southern half is tilted away and vice versa, what we experience as summer and winter. During summer in a given hemisphere, the Sun appears higher in the sky, making the days longer and warmer. Once a year, the Sun's declination, the angle between the equator and the position on the Earth where the Sun appears directly overhead reaches its maximum. This day is known as the summer solstice, the longest day of the year, and the one day where the Sun  appears highest in the sky. So the Earth's axial tilt partially explains why the Sun changes positions in the sky and the analemma's length represents the full 46.8 degrees of the sun's declination throughout the year. But why is it a figure eight and not just a straight line? This is due to another feature of the Earth's revolution, its orbital eccentricity. The Earth's orbit around the Sun is an ellipse, with its distance to the Sun changing at various points. The corresponding change in gravitational force causes the Earth to move fastest in January when it reaches  its closest point to the Sun, the perihelion, and the slowest in July when it reaches its farthest point, the aphelion. The Earth's eccentricity  means that solar noon, the time when the Sun  is highest in the sky, doesn't always occur at the same point in the day. So a sundial may be as much as sixteen minutes ahead or fourteen minutes behind a regular clock. In fact, clock time and Sun time only match four times a year. The analemma's width represents the extent of this deviation. So how did people know  the correct time years ago? For most of human history, going by the Sun's position was close enough. But during the modern era, the difference between sundials and mechanical clocks became important. The equation of time,  introduced by Ptolemy and later refined based on the work of Johannes Kepler, converts between apparent solar time and the mean time we've all come to rely on. Globes even used to have the analemma printed on them to allow people to determine  the difference between clock time and solar time based on the day of the year. Just how the analemma appears depends upon where you are. It will be tilted at an angle depending on your latitude or inverted if you're in  the southern hemisphere. And if you're on another planet, you might find something  completely different. Depending on that planet's  orbital eccentricity and axial tilt, the analemma might appear as a tear drop, oval, or even a straight line. "
389,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,XvUHcsZOhJ8,"From sailors who were turned into pigs, nymphs that sprouted into trees, and a gaze that converted  the beholder to stone, Greek mythology brims with shape-shifters. The powerful gods usually changed their own forms at will, but for mortals, the mutations  were often unwanted. One such unnerving transformation  befell the spinner Arachne. Arachne was the daughter  of a tradesman who spent his days dying cloth the deepest shades of purple. She had a flair for spinning  the finest threads, weaving them into flowing fabric, and creating magnificent tapestries. People flocked to watch her hands  flying across her loom, as if thread sprung directly  from her fingertips. But as praise for her work grew,  so did her pride. Arachne could often be heard  boasting about her skills, declaring that her talent surpassed  anyone else’s—mortal or divine. She refused to see weaving  as a gift from the gods. Rather, she flaunted it as her own personal genius. Unfortunately, the goddess of wisdom and crafts, Athena, overheard Arachne  making these claims. Planning to teach the ungrateful girl a lesson, Athena disguised herself as an old woman and stole amongst the mortals. She berated Arachne in public— how dare the weaver claim herself greater than the gods? But Arachne only laughed,  barely looking up from her loom. Provoked, the old woman threw off her cloak to reveal her true form. If Arachne insisted on defaming the gods, Athena would challenge her to a contest directly. Masking her shock at the appearance of the grey-eyed goddess, Arachne accepted the challenge. Athena drew up her own glittering loom  as a great crowd gathered to watch. The weavers began,  eyes fixed and shuttles blurring. Athena conjured wisps of cloud from above and slender threads of grass from below in a spectacle of strength. She wove tremendous scenes that showed the power of the gods: Poseidon riding the waves, Zeus firing thunderbolts, and Apollo hurtling across the sky. In Athena’s splendid tapestry,  the glory of the gods dwarfed mortal life. But Arachne had no interest  in boosting godly egos. Her tapestry showed the gods abusing their power: squabbling amongst themselves, drinking and bragging, and meddling in the lives of mortals. She represented Zeus as a philanderer, transfiguring himself to ensnare women: a swan for Leda, a bull for Europa, a shower of gold for Danae. Arachne then turned to the misdemeanors of other gods, from Pluto’s abduction of Persephone to Bacchus’s wild pursuit of Erigone. Even though she cast the gods  in the most unflattering light, Arachne’s work shone  with her dazzling skill. Her tapestry was almost alive, filled with movement  and lustrous colors that winked triumphantly. When Athena saw Arachne's undeniably better and flagrantly subversive work, she flew into a rage  and turned on the human weaver. Arachne’s glee dimmed as she felt her body shrinking and contorting. Her fingers waved wildly  as her arms stuck to her sides, and black hair sprouted all over her body. The goddess left Arachne with a single spool of thread unfurling from her belly, a slim reminder of her human talent. For challenging the assumption that the gods were untouchable, Athena had shrunk her adversary  into the first spider. To this day, Arachne and her children spin out her penance— or is it undaunted persistence?— in the shadows of giants. "

""She kept Caesar lounging  in Egypt for months when Rome needed him."" ""Caesar did more than lounge. He was fascinated by Egypt's culture and knowledge, and he learned much during his time there. When he returned to Rome,  he reformed the calendar, commissioned a census, made plans for a public library, and proposed many new infrastructure projects."" ""Yes, all very ambitious, exactly what got him assassinated."" ""Don't blame the Queen for Rome's strange politics. Her job was ruling Egypt, and she did it well. She stabilized the economy, managed the vast bureaucracy, and curbed corruption by priests and officials. When drought hit, she opened the granaries to the public and passed a tax amnesty, all while preserving her kingdom's stability and independence with no revolts during  the rest of her reign."" ""So what went wrong?"" ""After Caesar's death, this foreign Queen couldn't stop meddling in Roman matters."" ""Actually, it was the Roman factions who came demanding her aid. And of course she had no choice but to support Octavian and Marc Antony in avenging Caesar, if only for the sake of their son."" ""And again, she provided her particular kind of support to Marc Antony."" ""Why does that matter? Why doesn't anyone seem to care about Caesar or Antony's countless other affairs? Why do we assume she instigated the relationships? And why are only powerful women defined by their sexuality?"" ""Order."" ""Cleopatra and Antony were a disaster. They offended the Republic with their ridiculous celebrations sitting on golden thrones and dressing up as gods until Octavian had all of Rome convinced of their megalomania."" ""And yet Octavian was the one  who attacked Antony, annexed Egypt, and declared himself Emperor. It was the Roman's fear of a woman in power that ended their Republic, not the woman herself."" ""How ironic."" Cleopatra's story survived mainly in the accounts of her enemies in Rome, and later writers filled the gaps  with rumors and stereotypes. We may never know the full truth of her life and her reign, but we can separate fact from rumor by putting history on trial. "

She had been imprisoned for her activities as an Allied spy, but with the help of a screwdriver and  two other prisoners, she was back under the Parisian stars. As she began to run, her thoughts leapt to the whirlwind  of events that had brought her here… Born in Moscow in 1914 to an Indian  Muslim father and an American mother, Noor was raised in a profoundly  peaceful home. Her parents were Sufi pacifists, who put their faith in the power of  music and compassion. They moved to Paris, where Noor studied child psychology  and published children’s books. But all this changed with the advent  of the Second World War. In May 1940, with the German army  ready to occupy Paris, Noor and her brother were faced  with a difficult choice. As pacifists, they believed that all  disputes should be settled non-violently. But witnessing the devastation  across Europe, they decided that standing on the  sidelines was not an option. Traveling to England, Noor volunteered for the Women’s  Auxiliary Air Force and trained as a radio operator. She immersed herself in wireless operations and Morse code– unaware that she was being monitored by a secret organization. The British Special Operations Executive was established to sabotage the Germans  in Nazi-occupied countries. As a trained radio operator who knew  Paris well and spoke fluent French, Noor was an attractive recruit. In her interview, she was warned that wireless operation was some of the most dangerous work in the intelligence field. Operators had to lug a conspicuous transmitter through enemy territory, and the clandestine agency couldn’t protect her if she was caught. Noor accepted her assignment immediately. While she was determined to take her  pacifist principles as far as possible, Noor had to learn the art of espionage. She learned how to contact intelligence networks, pick a lock, resist interrogation and fire a gun. In June 1943 she landed  in Angers, south of Paris, and made her way to the city armed  with a false passport, a pistol and a few French francs. But her network was compromised. Within a week of her deployment, all her fellow agents were arrested, and Noor was called home. She convinced her supervisors  to let her stay– which meant doing the work of six radio  operators singlehandedly. Over the following months, she tracked and transported supplies to the French resistance, sent reports of Nazi activity back  to London and arranged safe passage  for allied soldiers. This work was essential to building the  French resistance and Allied intelligence networks– and, ultimately, ending the war. Protected only by her quick  thinking and charisma, she frequently talked her way  out of questioning. When the Gestapo searched her on the train, she gave them a casual tour  of her “film projector.” When an officer spotted  her hanging her aerial, she chatted about her passion for  listening to music on the radio– and charmed him into helping  her set up the cable. In her entire four month tenure, her sharp wits and stealth  never failed her. But her charm had inspired  lethal jealousy. In October 1943, the sister of a colleague, in love with an agent that loved Noor, sold her address to the Gestapo. Noor refused to give away any information, focusing instead on her escape. Secreting a screwdriver away  from the guards, they were able to loosen a skylight  and slip out into the night. But just as the prisoners began  to run for their lives, an air raid siren alerted her captors. Noor was caught once again and sent to a German prison. Then, on to Dachau concentration camp. Despite being tortured,  deprived and isolated, Noor gave nothing away. In the moments before her execution she is thought to have shouted “Liberté!” Since her heroic sacrifice, Noor has been honoured as a hero who waged secret battles behind enemy lines– paving the way for freedom without ever taking a life.

392,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Y8ZXOfWUbms,"In 1962, a cave explorer  named Michel Siffre started a series of experiments where he isolated himself underground for months without light or clocks. He attached himself to electrodes that monitored his vital signs and kept track of when he slept and ate. When Siffre finally emerged, the results of his pioneering experiments revealed that his body had kept to a regular sleeping-waking cycle. Despite having no external cues, he fell asleep, woke up, and ate at fixed intervals. This became known as a circadian rhythm from the Latin for ""about a day."" Scientists later found these rhythms affect our hormone secretion, how our bodies process food, and even the effects of drugs on our bodies. The field of sciences studying these changes is called chronobiology. Being able to sense time helps us do everything from waking and sleeping to knowing precisely when to catch a ball that's hurtling towards us. We owe all these abilities to an interconnected system of timekeepers in our brains. It contains the equivalent of a stopwatch telling us how many seconds elapsed, a clock counting the hours of the day, and a calendar notifying us of the seasons. Each one is located in  a different brain region. Siffre, stuck in his dark cave, relied on the most primitive clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN of the hypothalamus. Here's the basics of how we think it works based on fruitfly and mouse studies. Proteins known as CLK, or clock, accumulate in the SCN throughout the day. In addition to activating genes that tell us to stay awake, they make another protein called PER. When enough PER accumulates, it deactivates the gene that makes CLK, eventually making us fall asleep. Then, clock falls low, so PER  concentrations also drop again, allowing CLK to rise, starting the cycle over. There are other proteins involved, but our day and night cycle may be driven in part by this seesaw effect between CLK by day and PER by night. For more precision, our SCNs also rely  on external cues like light, food, noise, and temperature. We called these zeitgebers, German for ""givers of time."" Siffre lacked many  of these cues underground, but in normal life, they fine tune our daily behavior. For instance, as natural morning light filters into our eyes, it helps wake us up. Traveling through the optic nerve to the SCN, it communicates what's happening in the outside world. The hypothalamus then halts the production of melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. At the same time, it increases the production of vasopressin and noradrenaline throughout the brain, which help control our sleep cycles. At about 10 am, the body's rising temperature drives up our energy and alertness, and later in the afternoon, it also improves our muscle activity and coordination. Bright screens at night can confuse these signals, which is why binging on TV before bed makes it harder to sleep. But sometimes we need to be even more precise when telling the time, which is where the brain's internal  stopwatch chimes in. One theory for how this works  involves the fact that communication between a given pair of neurons always takes roughly the same amount of time. So neurons in our cortex  and other brain areas may communicate in scheduled, predictable loops that the cortex uses to judge with precision how much time has passed. That creates our perception of time. In his cave, Siffre made a fascinating additional discovery about this. Every day, he challenged himself  to count up to 120 at the rate of one digit per second. Over time, instead of taking two minutes, it began taking him as long as five. Life in the lonely, dark cave had warped Siffre's own perception of time despite his brain's best efforts to keep him on track. This makes us wonder what else influences our sense of time. And if time isn't objective,  what does that mean? Could each of us  be experiencing it differently? Only time will tell. "
393,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,YAhtYq62WOc,"In Argos, centuries and centuries ago... There lived a king. Acrisius. He had a single child, a daughter more radiant than any other woman of the world. This child though, he valued not; for what he wanted was a son. But you know what they say: be careful what you wish for. Acrisius, King of Argo. In his desire for a son, went to Delphi to ask the priestess if he might have one, No, they told him and threw in a bonus second part of the prophecy for free. They told him that his daughter though, would have a son and that that son would, in time, kill him. Horrified, he decided that the only way to avoid fate -- something which if he had read any mythology, he'd realized you just don't get to do -- was to kill his own daughter. He feared the Furies though, for their vengeance was especially harsh for those who had committed crimes against their own blood. So being of sound mind and quick thinking -- as anyone who's about to kill their own daughter clearly is -- he came to the most obvious solution. He figured he'd simply build a house of bronze underneath the ground, with just enough of it open to the air that his daughter might breathe, and then Imprison her there forever. Great plan, but it had one fatal flaw. Zeus. You see, Acrisius, his daughter, being very lovely, and Zeus, being Zeus, meant that inevitably Zeus came down to her in the form of rain through the open portal and impregnated her. Because you know that was (sighs) kind of his thing. She was able to hide the pregnancy from her father and even hide the boy she'd bore for a little while. But eventually, Acrisius found them. So now, Acrisius really had to get his murder on but he ran into the same problem; the Furies. Then he had it! He hit upon an even sounder plan. if he put them both in a chest, and drop it in the ocean. then he'd totally not be responsible for the murder. Get it? This would ensure it was totally the sea that killed them, not him. ""You see, the sea did it, you see?"" That sound logic was 100% going to work on the Furies So with this impeccable and unimpeachable plan, he locked them both in a chest and dumped it over the side of a boat. But turns out, his plan was both peccable and impeachable. Because in his ""towering genius"", he forgot to make the box, you know, sink. Yep, he dumped them in a buoyant chest and didn't weigh it down. But they were still locked in the box. So from their perspective, they're still not great And thus they floated, bobbing on the waves, until finally there was a thud and the motion stopped. They had washed up on a beach and, as fortune would have it, a fisherman found them and took pity on them. Childless, he brought them into his home and with his wife helped raise the boy...whose name was Perseus. Perseus grew strong, following his adopted grandfather's trade, living simply with his family as a fisherman. But peace was not fated for him, as his adopted grandfather's brother, Polydectes, the despot of the island, took notice of his mother, who was still very beautiful and desired her...just not her son. Being slightly more cunning than the last ruler we ran into though, Polydectes came up with a crafty plan. Step one: He befriended Perseus and told him about a group of terrible monsters that lived on an island far away. They were called the Gorgons. They had wild hair, all of snakes, terrible wings that beat the air, and whosoever looked at them turned to stone living no more. Step two: He told Perseus of his one great desire more than anything else; he wanted the head of one of the Gorgons to treasure for his own. Step three: He invited all of the great men of the island to a feast and declared that he intended to wed, knowing what would come next. Each of the guests in turn rose and toasted him and told him they would give him a horse for his wedding. But Perseus was poorer than these men and had no horse to give. So, as his pride welled up inside him, he stood and declared that he would bring the head of Medusa, the only mortal of the three Gorgon sisters, as a wedding gift. There was shocked silence, but the despot grinned. All had gone according to his highly straightforward plan. So Perseus raced out and boarded a ship for Greece before his mother could discover what he'd proposed...and before he could ask his mother what the despot might really be up to So having about as good of a plan as everyone else at this point, he made his way to Delphi to see if they might tell him what to do. In typical helpful Delphic fashion, they told him to go to the land where people only eat acorns and, luckily as the sheltered son of a fisherman who had never left his island before, he guessed the answer right in one try and knew exactly where they were talking about. So he made his way to Dodana; where the talking oaks speak the will of Zeus and the people only eat acorns. Unfortunately, they were basically no help at all because they didn't actually know where the Gorgons were. Despondent, he wandered aimlessly for a while until at last he ran into a striking young man fine of features with just the beginnings of a beard carrying a golden wand wearing winged sandals and a winged hat. He knew at once, this must be Hermes. Hermes told him that to fight Medusa he would need better gear, specifically some items a group of nymphs were holding on to. Unfortunately, and let's be real at this point stereotypically, he couldn't tell Perseus where the nymphs were. All he could tell him was of the gray women who alone knew the way to the nymphs. And so, he told Perseus of a twilight land; stuck in perpetual shroud lit by neither the sun nor the moon, but some force of its own where the three women lived. But these women were not like the mortal women Perseus knew. Oh no... they were gray and haggard, but did not age more astonishingly still they had the forms of swans with human heads. Most striking though, the three sisters had but one eye between them. They would take turns with the eye popping it out of their forehead and handing it to the next one when their time with it was up. It was to them, he must go to continue his quest for the weirdest wedding gift ever. And that's a story we'll all keep an eye on for next time. ...Could someone pass the marshmallows? "
394,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,YEaSxhcns7Y,"When we talk about English, we often think of it as a single language but what do the dialects spoken in dozens of countries around the world have in common with each other, or with the writings of Chaucer? And how are any of them related to the strange words in Beowulf? The answer is that like most languages, English has evolved through generations of speakers, undergoing major changes over time. By undoing these changes, we can trace the language  from the present day back to its ancient roots. While modern English  shares many similar words with Latin-derived romance languages, like French and Spanish, most of those words  were not originally part of it. Instead, they started coming  into the language with the Norman invasion of England in 1066. When the French-speaking Normans conquered England and became its ruling class, they brought their speech with them, adding a massive amount  of French and Latin vocabulary to the English language previously spoken there. Today, we call that language Old English. This is the language of Beowulf. It probably doesn't look very familiar, but it might be more recognizable if you know some German. That's because Old English belongs to the Germanic language family, first brought to the British Isles in the 5th and 6th centuries by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. The Germanic dialects they spoke would become known as Anglo-Saxon. Viking invaders in the 8th  to 11th centuries added more borrowings  from Old Norse into the mix. It may be hard to see the roots of modern English underneath all the words borrowed from French, Latin, Old Norse and other languages. But comparative linguistics can help us by focusing on grammatical structure, patterns of sound changes, and certain core vocabulary. For example, after the 6th century, German words starting with ""p,"" systematically shifted to a ""pf"" sound while their Old English counterparts kept the ""p"" unchanged. In another split, words  that have ""sk"" sounds in Swedish developed an ""sh"" sound in English. There are still some English words with ""sk,"" like ""skirt,"" and ""skull,"" but they're direct borrowings from Old Norse that came after the ""sk"" to ""sh"" shift. These examples show us that just as the various Romance languages descended from Latin, English, Swedish, German,  and many other languages descended from their own common ancestor known as Proto-Germanic spoken around 500 B.C.E. Because this historical language was never written down, we can only reconstruct it by comparing its descendants, which is possible thanks to the consistency of the changes. We can even use the same process to go back one step further, and trace the origins of Proto-Germanic to a language called Proto-Indo-European, spoken about 6000 years ago on the Pontic steppe  in modern day Ukraine and Russia. This is the reconstructed ancestor of the Indo-European family that includes nearly all languages historically spoken in Europe, as well as large parts of Southern and Western Asia. And though it requires a bit more work, we can find the same systematic similarities, or correspondences, between related words in different Indo-European branches. Comparing English with Latin, we see that English has ""t""  where Latin has ""d"", and ""f"" where latin has ""p"" at the start of words. Some of English's more distant relatives include Hindi, Persian and the Celtic languages it displaced in what is now Britain. Proto-Indo-European itself descended from an even more ancient language, but unfortunately, this is as far back as historical and archeological evidence will allow us to go. Many mysteries remain just out of reach, such as whether there might be a link between Indo-European and other major language families, and the nature of the languages spoken in Europe prior to its arrival. But the amazing fact remains that nearly 3 billion people around the world, many of whom cannot understand each other, are nevertheless speaking the same words shaped by 6000 years of history. "

It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed.” Fahrenheit 451 opens in a blissful blaze - and before long, we learn what’s going up in flames. Ray Bradbury’s novel imagines a world where books are banned from all areas of life - and possessing, let alone  reading them, is forbidden. The protagonist, Montag, is a fireman responsible for destroying what remains. But as his pleasure gives way to doubt, the story raises critical questions of how to preserve one’s mind in a society where free will, self-expression, and curiosity are under fire. In Montag’s world, mass media has a monopoly on information, erasing almost all ability for independent thought. On the subway, ads blast out of the walls. At home, Montag’s wife Mildred listens to the radio around the clock, and three of their parlor walls are plastered with screens. At work, the smell of kerosene hangs over Montag’s colleagues, who smoke and set their mechanical hound after rats to pass the time. When the alarm sounds they surge out in salamander-shaped vehicles, sometimes to burn whole libraries to the ground. But as he sets tomes ablaze day after day like “black butterflies,” Montag’s mind occasionally wanders to the contraband that lies hidden in his home. Gradually, he begins to question the basis of his work. Montag realizes he’s always felt uneasy - but has lacked the descriptive words to express his feelings in a society where even uttering the phrase “once upon a time” can be fatal. Fahrenheit 451 depicts a world governed by surveillance, robotics, and virtual reality- a vision that proved remarkably prescient, but also spoke to the concerns of the time. The novel was published in 1953, at the height of the Cold War. This era kindled widespread  paranoia and fear throughout Bradbury’s home  country of the United States, amplified by the suppression of information and brutal government investigations. In particular, this witch hunt mentality targeted artists and writers who were suspected of Communist sympathies. Bradbury was alarmed at this cultural crackdown. He believed it set a dangerous precedent for further censorship, and was reminded of the destruction of the Library of Alexandria and the book-burning of Fascist regimes. He explored these chilling  connections in Fahrenheit 451, titled after the temperature  at which paper burns. The accuracy of that temperature has been called into question, but that doesn’t diminish the novel’s  standing as a masterpiece of dystopian fiction. Dystopian fiction as a genre amplifies troubling features of the world around us and imagines the consequences of taking them to an extreme. In many dystopian stories, the government imposes constrictions onto unwilling subjects. But in Fahrenheit 451, Montag learns that it was the apathy of the masses that gave rise to the current regime. The government merely capitalized on short attention spans and the appetite for  mindless entertainment, reducing the circulation of ideas to ash. As culture disappears, imagination and self-expression follow. Even the way people talk is short-circuited - such as when Montag’s boss Captain Beatty describes the acceleration of mass culture: ""Speed up the film, Montag, quick. Click? Pic? Look, Eye, Now, Flick, Here, There, Swift, Pace, Up, Down, In, Out, Why, How, Who, What, Where, Eh? Uh! Bang! Smack! Wallop, Bing, Bong, Boom! Digest-digests, digest-digest-digests. Politics? One column, two sentences, a headline! Then, in mid-air, all vanishes!"" In this barren world, Montag learns how difficult it is to resist when there's nothing left to hold on to. Altogether, Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait of independent thought on the brink of extinction - and a parable about a society which is complicit in its own combustion. "
396,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,YPytwp5ll9g,"A man stands outside the city walls, looking into the desert. For the last two decades, he has traveled across the Islamic world from China to Andalusia, Spain. Along the way, he had been shipwrecked, kidnapped by rebels and detained by a mad sultan. The year before, he had crossed Arabia at the height of the Black Plague. But this would be his gratest adventure: a land so remote that few had seen it. But those who did told of its magnificent wealth. Ibn Battuta mounted his camel and prepared to cross the Sahara. (music) It was 1352. And though Mansa Musa had been dead for 50 years, stories of the king's golden pilgrimage train were still drawing scholars to the Islamic world's richest empire. We know this because Ibn Battuta began his trip that year with the simple hope of secureing the judicial appointment. It would be a hard journey, but in accomplishing it, Ibn Battuta would end up seeing almost the entirety of Mali's trans-Saharan trade routes, a network that had made Mansa Musa so rich that, as we will see in the next episode, he could give handfuls of gold to passers-by without a thought. Ibn Battuta would later record this adventure in his epic book, the Travells producing the only eye-witness account of the Mali Empire. So, today we're going to follow him letting his journey teach us about how trade built the realm. Ibn Battuta's first stop was an oasis city on the northern edge of the Sahara. Like all oasis towns, it was a riot of merchants and cargo shipments. Its square was crammed with the trade goods of North Africa and the Mediterranean, all going south to exchange for gold. There were textiles, books, jewellery, perfume and the cowry shells Malians exchanged as currency. Herds of Arabian horses waited outside the walls. Among the goods and caravans, Ibn Battuta found some Berber tradors, the ethnic group that had controlled the trans-Saharan trade, and he arranged to join their expedition. They traveled in the early morning and late afternoon, resting during the noonday heat. It took them 25 days to reach their first stop. ""It was a village"", he wrote, ""with nothing good about it"". It was a labor camp, an open-pit mine in the middle of the sand where enslaved people carved blocks of rock salt out of the earth. The water was brackish and both houses and mosques were built from salt with stretched camel skin for a roof. All food was imported on camel back. But despite this desolation, he saw vast amounts of gold change hands. Traders from Mali were buying salt in order to take it south to sell. Ultimately, this salt would go deep into the rainforests where no naturally occurring salt existed to help people retain water. Without it, the gold miners would dehydrate and die. After the caravan took on water and salt, they headed south. The next stretch was 500 miles with only one oasis. But the winter rain had been kind, and small pools sustained them. Even so, death awaited. One man from the caravan quarreled with his cousin and lagged behind to sulk. They never saw him again. When at last they arrived at the oasis, they hired a scout for the final and most dangerous part of the journey. See, no caravan could carry enough water to cross this last stretch of desert before Oualata. So, they would hire a scout to go ahead of them and contract a party to carry water 4 days north from the city in order to meet them on route. ""But this stretch of waste"", Ibn Battuta writes, ""was haunted by demons that disordered men's minds"". If the scout was disoriented or killed, there would be no resupply and the entire caravan would perish. Yet the scout did not die and the party met them with the water. Two long months after leaving the northern edge of the Sahara, Ibn Battuta's caravan entered Oualata, the first oasis city of the Mali Empire. the Berbers declare their goods to the tax officials and paid what was due. Ibn Battuta was thrilled. As an Islamic scholar, he loved to visit pious communities across the world to gauge the spiritual health of the Muslim periphery and exchange ideas with scholars. It had been towns like Oualata where Islam first appeared in Mali centuries before carried on camel back via the Barber caravans. Though Oualata was only a mud brick town of a few thousand people, Ibn Battuta would finally meet his first local scholar there. And that is when his enthusiasm crashed against the reality of religion in the Mali Empire. See, Mali was actually only partially converted. Islam was the religion of merchants and ruling class, people with cultural, political or economic links to North Africa. But the working people who farmed and mined the all important gold still practiced traditional African religion. Furthermore, many tenets of Islamic law were incompatible with Mali's culture, so most Muslims ignored them. The rulers of Mali had to walk a fine line fusing Islamic practice with their native traditions in order to keep society together. And, here's the thing about Ibn Battuta. He was kind of the 14th century version of obnoxious tourist. No matter where he went, he expected people to behave like they were Islamic scholars from Tangier. And if they didn't, he got judgemental real quick. And unfortunately, this trip to Mali shows Ibn Battuta at his worst. The first problem occurred when he met the local governor. As the representative of the sacred Mansa, the man spoke to Ibn Battuta through a herald rather than directly, which the traveler took as an insult. And though the meal of yogurt and millet the governor served was standard for welcoming guest to the Mali, Ibn Battuta considered it insufficient for a man of his rank. He had expected a monetary welcome gift like scholars received in much of the Islamic world. But here, yogurt and honey? REALLY? And the culture clash only got worse when he visited the local scholars and judges and discovered that even the Islamic upper class didn't abide by Muslim laws about gender relations. Here, even pious women went unveiled and women had a high degree of autonomy. On one occasion, Ibn Battuta informed a scholar that he'd seen the man's wife chatting with another man on the courtyard. When the scholar patiently explained that friendship between men and women was considered good conduct and engendered no suspicion, The traveler was so horrified that he fled the house. What troubled Ibn Battuta about these deviations was that he admired the empire's piety. The people observed prayer times, kept scrupulously clean for mosque and in a society where books were rare and expensive, insisted that children memorize the Quran. Admittedly, they used methods that would be frowned upon today, but still. And as he traveled toward the capital, he marveled at the country's security. Once within the boundaries of the empire, he could travel alone without fear of bandits. This was by design. Mali possessed a strong capable military, which existed mostly to enforce taxes and ensure the banditry didn't endanger the all important trade routes. According to Ibn Battuta, their justice system was fair and disciplined. If a foreigner died in Mali, instead of pillaging the man's trade goods, the government turned everything over to a trustee until the man's relatives claimed it. However, upon reaching the capital, Ibn Battuta was disturbed to find how deeply African religion and culture influenced the court. Young women like the mansa's daughters walked about topless in the palace. Festivals included folk dances and masked performances that he considered absurd and pagan. It rankled him that courtiers washed themselves with dust when the mansa spoke to them. And that soldier stood in front of the emperor to tell their service in battle while others twanged their bows to confirm that they had witnessed the heroic deed. But he did finally get a welcome gift from the emperor. Three bread cakes, a piece of beef and a calabash of sour curds. At this, he burst out laughing. ""Wow, the Mansa's legendary generosity!"" ""That's it. Screw this. Battuta out."" But, even Battuta's touristy reactions do tell us something interesting about Mali. Due to its geographic separation, Mali had assimilated Islam rather than been absorbed by it, creating a religeously tolerant, pluralistic society. It was a proudly West African empire with its own identity. And it wasn't going to just leave its traditions behind to adopt this new religion. Indeed, Mali seems to have intentionally kept foreign influence at arm's length. Ibn Battuta never got to visit the gold mines and that was intentional. The Malian government kept foreigners away from its most precious resource bringing gold to be exchanged at trading hubs rather than exposing the location of their mines. It was state security. Mali's economy ran on gold producing around two thirds of the world's supply with its economy supported entirely by demand from Islamic states and christian Europe, which had recently abandoned silver in favor of this fancy new metal. But before he left, Ibn Battuta would have one more journey along the trade routes east along the Niger River to the city of Timbuktu. A developing hub between the desert caravans and river traffic. He likely spent this trip amid a whole lot of exports Mali sent north along with its gold: ivory, kola nuts, ostrich feathers, raisins and enslaved people. And of course, the gold Ibn Battuta had finally received after complaining to the mansa's face. As he watched the river slid by, he no doubt thought back on the stories he heard in Cairo about Mansa Musa's generousity and piety. The unimaginable wealth of his pilgrimage train.

397,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,YVfyYrEmzgM,"Hunger claws at your grumbling belly. It tugs at your intestines, which begin to writhe, aching to be fed. Being hungry generates a powerful, often unpleasant physical sensation that's almost impossible to ignore. After you've reacted by gorging on your morning pancakes, you start to experience  an opposing force, fullness, but how does your body actually know when you're full? The sensation of fullness is set in motion as food moves from your mouth down your esophagus. Once it hits your stomach, it gradually fills the space. That causes the surrounding muscular wall to stretch, expanding slowly like a balloon. A multitude of nerves wrapped intricately around the stomach wall sense the stretching. They communicate with the vagus nerve up to the brainstem and hypothalamus, the main parts of the brain that control food intake. But that's just one input your brain uses to sense fullness. After all, if you fill  your stomach with water, you won't feel full for long. Your brain also takes into account chemical messengers in the form of hormones produced by endocrine cells throughout your digestive system. These respond to the presence of specific nutrients in your gut and bloodstream, which gradually increase as you digest your food. As the hormones seep out, they're swept up by the blood and eventually reach the hypothalamus in the brain. Over 20 gastrointestinal hormones are involved in moderating our appetites. One example is cholecystokinin, which is produced in response to food by cells in the upper small bowel. When it reached the hypothalamus, it causes a reduction in the feeling of reward you get when you eat food. When that occurs, the sense of being satiated starts to sink in and you stop eating. Cholecystokinin also slows down the movement of food from the stomach into the intestines. That makes your stomach stretch more over a period of time, allowing your body to register that you're filling up. This seems to be why when you eat slowly, you actually feel fuller compared to when you consume your food at lightning speed. When you eat quickly, your body doesn't have time to recognize the state it's in. Once nutrients and gastrointestinal hormones are present in the blood, they trigger the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin stimulates the body's fat cells to make another hormone called leptin. Leptin reacts with receptors on neuron populations in the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus has two sets of neurons important for our feeling of hunger. One set produces the sensation of hunger by making and releasing certain proteins. The other set inhibits hunger through its own set of compounds. Leptin inhibits the hypothalamus neurons that drive food intake and stimulates the neurons  that suppress it. By this point, your body has reached peak fullness. Through the constant exchange  of information between hormones, the vagus nerve, the brainstem, and the different portions  of hypothalamus, your brain gets the signal that you've eaten enough. Researchers have discovered that some foods produce  more long-lasting fullness than others. For instance, boiled potatoes are ranked as some of the most hunger-satisfying foods, while croissants  are particularly unsatisfying. In general, foods with more protein, fiber, and water tend to keep hunger at bay for longer. But feeling full won't last forever. After a few hours, your gut and brain begin their conversation again. Your empty stomach produces other hormones, such as ghrelin, that increase the activity of  the hunger-causing nerve cells in the hypothalamus. Eventually, the growling beast of hunger is reawakened. Luckily, there's a dependable  antidote for that. "
398,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,YompsDlEdtc,"What do Euclid, twelve-year-old Einstein, and American President James Garfield have in common? They all came up with elegant proofs for the famous Pythagorean theorem, the rule that says for a right triangle, the square of one side plus the square of the other side is equal to the square of the hypotenuse. In other words, a²+b²=c². This statement is one of the most fundamental rules of geometry, and the basis for practical applications, like constructing stable buildings and triangulating GPS coordinates. The theorem is named for Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher and mathematician in the 6th century B.C., but it was known more than a thousand years earlier. A Babylonian tablet from around 1800 B.C. lists 15 sets of numbers that satisfy the theorem. Some historians speculate that Ancient Egyptian surveyors used one such set of numbers, 3, 4, 5, to make square corners. The theory is that surveyors could stretch a knotted rope with twelve equal segments to form a triangle with sides of length 3, 4 and 5. According to the converse of the Pythagorean theorem, that has to make a right triangle, and, therefore, a square corner. And the earliest known Indian mathematical texts written between 800 and 600 B.C. state that a rope stretched across the diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large as the original one. That relationship can be derived from the Pythagorean theorem. But how do we know  that the theorem is true for every right triangle on a flat surface, not just the ones these mathematicians and surveyors knew about? Because we can prove it. Proofs use existing mathematical rules and logic to demonstrate that a theorem must hold true all the time. One classic proof often attributed to Pythagoras himself uses a strategy called  proof by rearrangement. Take four identical right triangles with side lengths a and b and hypotenuse length c. Arrange them so that their hypotenuses form a tilted square. The area of that square is c². Now rearrange the triangles into two rectangles, leaving smaller squares on either side. The areas of those squares are a² and b². Here's the key. The total area of the figure didn't change, and the areas of the triangles didn't change. So the empty space in one, c² must be equal to  the empty space in the other, a² + b². Another proof comes from a fellow Greek mathematician Euclid and was also stumbled upon almost 2,000 years later by twelve-year-old Einstein. This proof divides one right triangle into two others and uses the principle that if the corresponding angles of two triangles are the same, the ratio of their sides is the same, too. So for these three similar triangles, you can write these expressions for their sides. Next, rearrange the terms. And finally, add the two equations together and simplify to get ab²+ac²=bc², or a²+b²=c². Here's one that uses tessellation, a repeating geometric pattern for a more visual proof. Can you see how it works? Pause the video if you'd like some time to think about it. Here's the answer. The dark gray square is a² and the light gray one is b². The one outlined in blue is c². Each blue outlined square contains the pieces of exactly one dark and one light gray square, proving the Pythagorean theorem again. And if you'd really like to convince yourself, you could build a turntable with three square boxes of equal depth connected to each other around a right triangle. If you fill the largest square with water and spin the turntable, the water from the large square will perfectly fill the two smaller ones. The Pythagorean theorem has more than 350 proofs, and counting, ranging from brilliant to obscure. Can you add your own to the mix? "
399,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,YtE0OsRWeYI,"The first standardized tests  that we know of were administered in China over 2,000 years ago during the Han dynasty. Chinese officials used them to determine aptitude for various government posts. The subject matter included philosophy, farming, and even military tactics. Standardized tests continued to be used around the world for the next two millennia, and today, they're used for everything from evaluating stair climbs for firefighters in France to language examinations  for diplomats in Canada to students in schools. Some standardized tests measure scores only in relation to the results  of other test takers. Others measure performances on how well test takers meet predetermined criteria. So the stair climb for the firefighter could be measured by comparing the time of the climb to that of all other firefighters. This might be expressed in what  many call a bell curve. Or it could be evaluated with reference to set criteria, such as carrying a certain amount  of weight a certain distance up a certain number of stairs. Similarly, the diplomat might be measured against other test-taking diplomats, or against a set of fixed criteria, which demonstrate different levels of language proficiency. And all of these results can be expressed using something called a percentile. If a diplomat is in the 70th percentile, 70% of test takers scored below her. If she scored in the 30th percentile, 70% of test takers scored above her. Although standardized tests  are sometimes controversial, they're simply a tool. As a thought experiment,  think of a standardized test as a ruler. A ruler's usefulness  depends on two things. First, the job we ask it to do. Our ruler can't measure  the temperature outside or how loud someone is singing. Second, the ruler's usefulness depends on its design. Say you need to measure the circumference of an orange. Our ruler measures length, which is the right quantity, but it hasn't been designed with the  flexibility required for the task at hand. So, if standardized tests are given the wrong job, or aren't designed properly, they may end up measuring the wrong things. In the case of schools, students with test anxiety may have  trouble performing their best on a standardized test, not because they don't know the answers, but because they're feeling too nervous to share what they've learned. Students with reading challenges may struggle with the wording of a math problem, so their test results may better reflect their literacy rather than numeracy skills. And students who were confused by examples on tests that contain  unfamiliar cultural references may do poorly, telling us more about the test taker's cultural familiarity than their academic learning. In these cases, the tests may need to be designed differently. Standardized tests can also  have a hard time measuring abstract  characteristics or skills, such as creativity, critical thinking, and collaboration. If we design a test poorly, or ask it to do the wrong job, or a job it's not very good at, the results may not be reliable or valid. Reliability and validity  are two critical ideas for understanding standardized tests. To understand the difference between them, we can use the metaphor  of two broken thermometers. An unreliable thermometer gives you a different reading  each time you take your temperature, and the reliable but invalid thermometer is consistently ten degrees too hot. Validity also depends on accurate interpretations of results. If people say results of a test mean something they don't, that test may have a validity problem. Just as we wouldn't expect a ruler to tell us how much an elephant weighs, or what it had for breakfast, we can't expect standardized tests alone to reliably tell us how smart someone is, how diplomats will handle a tough situation, or how brave a firefighter  might turn out to be. So standardized tests may help us learn a little about a lot of people in a short time, but they usually can't tell us a lot about a single person. Many social scientists worry about test scores resulting in sweeping and often negative changes for test takers, sometimes with long-term life consequences. We can't blame the tests, though. It's up to us to use the right tests for the right jobs, and to interpret results appropriately. "
400,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ZCKRjP_DMII,"Rising temperatures and seas, massive droughts, changing landscapes. Successfully adapting to climate change is growing increasingly important. For humans, this means using our technological advancement to find solutions, like smarter cities and better water management. But for some plants and animals, adapting to these global changes involves the most ancient solution of all: evolution. Evolutionary adaptation usually occurs along time scales of thousands to hundreds of thousands of years. But in cases where species are under especially strong selective conditions, like those caused by rapidly changing climates, adaptive evolution  can happen more quickly. In recent decades, we've seen many plants, animals, and insects relocating themselves and undergoing changes to their body sizes, and the dates they flower or breed. But many of these are plastic, or nonheritable changes to an individual's physical traits. And there are limits to how much an organism can change its own physiology to meet environmental requirements. That's why scientists are seeking examples of evolutionary changes coded in species' DNA that are heritable, long-lasting, and may provide a key to their future. Take the tawny owl. If you were walking through a wintry forest in northern Europe 30 years ago, chances are you'd have heard, rather than seen, this elusive bird. Against the snowy backdrop, its plumage would have been near impossible to spot. Today, the landscape is vastly different. Since the 1980s, climate change has led to significantly less snowfall, but you'd still struggle to spot a tawny owl because nowadays, they're brown. The brown color variant is the genetically dominant form of plumage in this species, but historically, the recessive pale gray variant triumphed because of its selective advantage in helping these predators blend in. However, less snow cover reduces opportunities for camouflage, so lately, this gray color variant has been losing  the battle against natural selection. The offspring of the brown color morphs, on the other hand, have an advantage in exposed forests, so brown tawny owls are flourishing today. Several other species have undergone similar climate-change-adaptive genetic changes in recent decades. Pitcher plant mosquitoes have rapidly evolved to take advantage  of the warmer temperatures, entering dormancy later  and later in the year. Two spot ladybug populations, once comprised of equal numbers of melanic and non-melanic morphs, have now shifted almost entirely to the non-melanic color combination. Scientists think that keeps them from overheating. Meanwhile, pink salmon have adapted to warmer waters by spawning earlier in the season to protect their sensitive eggs. And wild thyme plants in Europe are producing more repellent oils to protect themselves  against the herbivores that become more common when it's warm. These plants and animals belong to a group of about 20 identified species with evolutionary adaptations to rapid climate change, including snapping turtles, wood frogs, knotweed, and silver spotted skipper butterflies. However, scientists hope to discover more species evolving in response to climate change out of 8.7 million species on the planet. For most of our planet's astounding and precious biodiversity, evolution won't be the answer. Instead, many of those species will have to rely on us to help them survive a changing world or face extinction. The good news is we already have the tools. Across the planet, we're making on-the-ground decisions that will help entire ecosystems adapt. Critical climate refuges  are being identified and set aside, and projects are underway to help mobile species move to more suitable climates. Existing parks and protected areas are also doing climate change check-ups to help their wildlife cope. Fortunately, it's still within our power to preserve much of  the wondrous biodiversity of this planet, which, after all, sustains us in so many ways. "
401,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ZJU34yTJL4M,"Food doesn't last. In days, sometimes hours, bread goes moldy, apple slices turn brown, and bacteria multiply in mayonnaise. But you can find all of these foods out on the shelf at the grocery store, hopefully unspoiled, thanks to preservatives. But what exactly are preservatives? How do they help keep food edible and are they safe? There are two major factors that cause food to go bad: microbes and oxidation. Microbes like bacteria and fungi invade food and feed off its nutrients. Some of these can cause diseases, like listeria and botulism. Others just turn edibles into a smelly, slimy, moldy mess. Meanwhile, oxidation is a chemical change in the food's molecules caused by enzymes or free radicals which turn fats rancid and brown produce,  like apples and potatoes. Preservatives can prevent both types of deterioration. Before the invention of artificial refrigeration, fungi and bacteria could run rampant in food. So we found ways to create an inhospitable environment for microbes. For example, making the food more acidic unravels enzymes that microbes need to survive. And some types of bacteria can actually help. For thousands of years, people preserved food using bacteria that produce lactic acid. The acid turns perishable vegetables and milk into longer lasting foods, like sauerkraut in Europe, kimchi in Korea, and yogurt in the Middle East. These cultured foods also populate your digestive track with beneficial microbes. Many synthetic preservatives are also acids. Benzoic acid in salad dressing, sorbic acid in cheese, and propionic acid in baked goods. Are they safe? Some studies suggest that benzoates, related to benzoic acid, contribute to hyperactive behavior. But the results aren't conclusive. Otherwise, these acids seem to be perfectly safe. Another antimicrobial strategy is to add a lot of sugar, like in jam, or salt, like in salted meats. Sugar and salt hold on to water that microbes need to grow and actually suck moisture out of any cells that may be hanging around, thus destroying them. Of course, too much sugar and salt can increase your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, so these preservatives are best in moderation. Antimicrobial nitrates and nitrites, often found in cured meats, ward off the bacteria that cause botulism, but they may cause other health problems. Some studies linking cured meats to cancer have suggested that these preservatives may be the culprit. Meanwhile, antioxidant preservatives prevent the chemical changes that can give food an off-flavor or color. Smoke has been used to preserve food for millennia because some of the aromatic compounds in wood smoke are antioxidants. Combining smoking with salting was an effective way of preserving meat before refrigeration. For antioxidant activity without a smoky flavor, there are compounds like BHT and tocopherol, better known as vitamin E. Like the compounds in smoke, these sop up free radicals and stave off rancid flavors that can develop in foods like oils, cheese, and cereal. Other antioxidants like citric acid and ascorbic acid help cut produce keep its color by thwarting the enzyme  that causes browning. Some compounds  like sulfites can multitask. They're both antimicrobials and antioxidants. Sulfites may cause allergy symptoms in some people, but most antioxidant preservatives are generally recognized as safe. So should you be worried  about preservatives? Well, they're usually near the end of the ingredients list because they're used in very small amounts determined by the FDA to be safe. Nevertheless, some consumers and companies are trying to find alternatives. Packaging tricks, like reducing the oxygen around the food can help, but without some kind  of chemical assistance, there are very few foods that can stay shelf stable for long. "
402,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ZMSbDwpIyF4,"Behold the human brain, it's lumpy landscape visibly split into a left and right side. This structure has inspired one of the most pervasive ideas about the brain, that the left side controls logic and the right, creativity. And yet, this is a myth unsupported by scientific evidence. So how did this misleading idea come about, and what does it get wrong? It's true that the brain has a right and a left side. This is most apparent  with the outer layer, or the cortex. Internal regions, like the striatum, hypothalamus, thalamus, and brain stem appear to be made from continuous tissue, but in fact, they're also organized with left and right sides. The left and the right sides of the brain do control different body functions, such as movement and sight. The brain's right side controls the motion of the left arm and leg and vice versa. The visual system is even more complex. Each eye has a left  and right visual field. Both left visual fields are sent to the right side of the brain, and both right fields are sent to the left side. So the brain uses both sides to make a complete image of the world. Scientists don't know for sure why we have that crossing over. One theory is it began soon after animals developed more complex nervous systems because it gave the survival advantage of quicker reflexes. If an animal sees a predator coming from its left side, it's best off escaping to the right. So we can say that vision and movement control are two systems that rely on this left-right structure, but problems arise when we over-extend that idea to logic and creativity. This misconception began in  the mid-1800s when two neurologists, Broca and Wernicke, examined patients who had problems communicating due to injuries. The researchers found damage to the patients' left temporal lobes, so they suggested that language is controlled by the left side of the brain. That captured the popular imagination. Author Robert Louis Stevenson then introduced the idea of a logical left hemisphere competing with an emotional  right hemisphere represented by his characters Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. But this idea didn't hold up when doctors and scientists examined patients who were missing a hemisphere or had their two hemispheres separated. These patients showed a complete range of behaviors, both logical and creative. Later research showed that one side of the brain is more active than the other for some functions. Language is more localized to the left and attention to the right. So one side of the brain may do more work, but this varies by system rather than by person. There isn't any evidence to suggest that individuals have dominant sides of the brain, or to support the idea  of a left-right split between logic and creativity. Some people may be particularly logical or creative, but that has nothing to do with the sides of their brains. And even the idea of logic and creativity being at odds with each other doesn't hold up well. Solving complex math problems requires inspired creativity and many vibrant works of art have intricate logical frameworks. Almost every feat of creativity and logic carries the mark of the whole brain functioning as one. "
403,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ZmaeljnPOu4,"It was a normal Tuesday  at the superconductor, until a bug in the system created  a small situation. Now your team is trapped in eleven  separate pocket dimensions. Luckily for you, there’s a half-finished  experimental teleportation robot that may be able to get you all home, if you can figure out how to work through the quirks of its design. Over interdimensional radio, your engineers explain that the robot can teleport into the  alternate universes you’re trapped in, but it’ll do so completely at random. The robot has two levers and one big button. When it appears, you just switch the position of one of the levers from A to B or vice versa, and then the robot will note your dimensional position and teleport to another of the eleven dimensions at random. If it shows up again, you’ll have to pull a lever before it’ll teleport away. When anyone presses the button, the robot will bring everyone who pulled a lever back home. Anyone who didn’t will be lost  in the multi-verse forever. The challenge is to make sure everyone has pulled a lever before anyone hits the button. While you can talk to each other now over the interdimensional radio and agree on a plan, the robot’s teleportation technology will interfere with all attempts at communication once it arrives. You won’t be able to attach messages to the robot or scratch notes into its superstrong alloy body. Your only way to communicate information is to change the position of exactly one lever or hit the button. What plan will make sure  everyone gets home? Pause the video now if you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It would be nice if you could set different combinations of the levers to indicate who’s already been visited by the robot. But it has only two levers. That gives four combinations— far too few to communicate  about 11 people, especially when you’re forced to flip  one to send the robot onward. There must be another way. The critical insight is that not everyone has to know when every pocket dimension has been visited. If one person accepts responsibility  ahead of time for hitting the button, then only they need to know who the robot has visited. In fact, they don’t even need to know  exactly who’s been visited… just how many people have been. You volunteer to be the person in charge of pressing the button when the moment is right, and give the following directions to everyone else. Your plan is simple: you’ll use the left lever to count visits, and the right lever will have no meaning, so there’s no harm in moving it up or down. Each of the others will pull the left lever from position A to position  B exactly once. If the robot appears with the left lever already pulled down, or if an individual has previously pulled the left lever down at any point in the past, then they should move the right lever. You, meanwhile, will be the only one who ever resets the left lever from position B to position A. This gives you a way to count how many  people have been visited by the robot. Everyone needs to pull the left lever  down exactly once, and you’re the only one  to pull it back up. So you know that the tenth time the robot visits you with its left lever in the down position, it must have visited  all ten of the others. And that means you’re safe to press the  button and teleport everyone home. It may take a while– most likely the robot will need to teleport around 355 times; but better that than leave anyone behind. Your teammates phase back into your home dimension one at a time. The mission proves a great success. Well...mostly. "
404,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Zsc8G0NnMTs,"Imagine aliens land on the planet a million years from now and look into the geologic record. What will these curious searchers find of us? They will find what geologists, scientists, and other experts are increasingly calling the Anthropocene, or new age of mankind. The impacts that we humans make have become so pervasive, profound, and permanent that some geologists argue we merit our own epoch. That would be a new unit in the geologic time scale that stretches back more than 4.5 billion years, or ever since the Earth took shape. Modern humans may be on par with the glaciers behind various ice ages or the asteroid that doomed most of the dinosaurs. What is an epoch? Most simply, it's a unit of geologic time. There's the Pleistocene, an icy epoch that saw the evolution of modern humans. Or there's the Eocene, more than 34 million years ago, a hothouse time during which the continents drifted  into their present configuration. Changes in climate or fossils found in the rock record help distinguish these epochs and help geologists tell deep time. So what will be the record  of modern people's impact on the planet? It doesn't rely on the things that may seem most obvious to us today, like sprawling cities. Even New York or Shanghai  may prove hard to find buried in the rocks  a million years from now. But humans have put new things into the world that never existed on Earth before, like plutonium and plastics. In fact, the geologists  known as stratigraphers who determine the geologic timescale, have proposed a start date for the Anthropocene around 1950. That's when people started blowing up nuclear bombs all around the world and scattering novel elements  to the winds. Those elements will last  in the rock record, even in our bones and teeth for millions of years. And in just 50 years,  we've made enough plastic, at least 8 billion metric tons, to cover the whole world in a thin film. People's farming, fishing, and forestry will also show up as a before and after in any such strata because it's those kinds of activities that are causing unique species  of plants and animals to die out. This die-off started perhaps more than 40,000 years ago as humanity spread out of Africa and reached places like Australia, kicking off the disappearance of big, likable, and edible animals. This is true of Europe and Asia, think woolly mammoth, as well as North and South America, too. For a species that has only roamed the planet for  a few hundred thousand years, Homo sapiens has had a big impact on the future fossil record. That also means that even if people were to disappear tomorrow, evolution would be driven  by our choices to date. We're making a new homogenous world of certain favored plants and animals, like corn and rats. But it's a world that's not as resilient as the one it replaces. As the fossil record shows, it's a diversity of plants and animals that allows unique pairings of flora and fauna to respond to environmental challenges, and even thrive after an apocalypse. That goes for people, too. If the microscopic plants  of the ocean suffer as a result of too much carbon dioxide, say, we'll lose the source of as much as half of the oxygen we need to breathe. Then there's the smudge in future rocks. People's penchant for burning coal, oil, and natural gas has spread tiny bits of soot all over the planet. That smudge corresponds with a meteoric rise in the amount  of carbon dioxide in the air, now beyond 400 parts per million, or higher than any other Homo sapiens has ever breathed. Similar soot can still  be found in ancient rocks from volcanic fires  of 66 million years ago, a record of the cataclysm touched off by an asteroid at the end of the late Cretaceous epoch. So odds are our soot will still be here 66 million years from now, easy enough to find for any aliens who care to look. Of course, there's an important difference between us and an asteroid. A space rock has no choice but to follow gravity. We can choose to do differently. And if we do, there might still be some kind of human civilization thousands or even millions of years from now. Not a bad record to hope for. "
405,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,Zx8zbTMTncs,"Here's what has to happen for pregnancy to occur after sexual intercourse. Sperm must swim up the vagina, through the cervical opening, upwards through the uterus, and into one of the two fallopian tubes. If an egg, released during  that month's ovulation, is in the tube, one sperm has a chance to fertilize it. Contraceptives are designed to prevent this process, and they work in three basic ways. They block the sperm, disable sperm  before they reach the uterus, or suppress ovulation. Block is the simplest. Male and female condoms prevent sperm from coming into contact with the vaginal space. That barrier is also why they, unlike other contraceptive methods, are able to prevent transmission of certain sexually transmitted diseases. Meanwhile, the diaphragm,  cervical cap, and sponge work by being placed over the cervix, barricading the entrance to the uterus. These contraceptives are sometimes called barrier methods and can be used with spermicides, an example of  the second category, disable. A spermicide is a chemical  that immobilizes and destroys sperm. Today's spermicides come as foam, cream, jelly, suppositories, and even a thin piece of translucent film that dissolves in the vagina. These products can be inserted directly into the vagina before intercourse, or can be combined with block methods, like a diaphragm or condom, for added proection. The third category  for preventing pregnancy works by suppressing the action of an egg maturing in the ovary. If there isn't an egg available  in the fallopian tube, there's nothing for sperm to fertilize. Hormonal contraceptives, including the pill, the patch,  the Depo shot, and the vaginal ring all release synthetic versions of various combinations of progesterone and estrogen. This hormone cocktail suppresses ovulation, keeping the immature egg safely sequestered in the ovary. Synthetic progesterone also has a block trick up its sleeve. It makes cervical mucus too thick and sticky for sperm to swim through easily. There are other contraceptives that use multiple approaches at the same time. For example, many IUDs, or intrauterine devices, contain synthetic hormones which suppress ovulation. Some also contain copper, which disable sperm while also making egg implantation in the uterus difficult. Block, disable, or suppress: is one strategy better than the other? There are differences, but a lot of it has to do with how convenient and easy it is to use  each contraceptive correctly. For example, male condoms would be about 98% effective if everyone used them perfectly. That 98% means if 100 couples correctly used condoms for a year, two women would get pregnant. But not everyone uses them correctly, so they're only 82% effective in practice. Other methods, like the patch and pill, are 99% effective when they're used perfectly. But in practice, that's 91%. Spermicide is only 85% effective, even with perfect usage, and just 71% effective with typical usage. Another important consideration in the choice of contraceptives are side effects, which almost exclusively affect women rather than men. Hormonal methods in particular can cause symptoms like headaches, nausea, and high blood pressure, but they vary from woman to woman. That's why these methods require a prescription from a doctor. The choice of contraceptive method is a personal one, and what works best for you now may change later. Scientists also continue to research new methods, such as a male pill that would prevent sperm production. In the meantime,  there are quite a few options to block sperm, disable them, or suppress eggs and keep them out of reach. "
406,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,_YqYtdPUis4,"What makes a book a book? Is it just anything that stores and communicates information? Or does it have to do with paper, binding, font, ink, its weight in your hands, the smell of the pages? Is this a book? Probably not. But is this? To answer these questions, we need to go back to the start of the book as we know it and understand how these elements came together to make something more than the sum of their parts. The earliest object that we think of as a book is the codex, a stack of pages bound along one edge. But the real turning point in book history was Johannes Gutenberg's printing press in the mid-15th century. The concept of moveable type had been invented much earlier in Eastern culture, but the introduction of Gutenberg's press had a profound effect. Suddenly, an elite class of monks and the ruling class no longer controlled  the production of texts. Messages could spread more easily, and copies could constantly be produced, so printing houses popped up all over Europe. The product of this bibliographic boom is familiar to us in some respects, but markedly different in others. The skeleton of the book is paper, type, and cover. More than 2000 years ago, China invented paper as a writing surface, which was itself predated by Egyptian papyrus. However, until the 16th century, Europeans mainly wrote on thin sheets of wood and durable parchment made of stretched animal skins. Eventually, the popularity of paper spread throughout Europe, replacing parchment for most printings because it was less expensive in bulk. Inks had been made by combining organic plant and animal dyes with water or wine, but since water doesn't stick to metal type, use of the printing press required a change to oil-based ink. Printers used black ink made of a mixture of lamp soot, turpentine, and walnut oil. And what about font size and type? The earliest movable type pieces consisted of reversed letters cast in relief on the ends of lead alloy stocks. They were handmade and expensive, and the designs were as different as the people who carved their molds. Standardization was not really possible until mass manufacturing and the creation of an accessible word processing system. As for style, we can thank Nicolas Jenson for developing two types of Roman font that led to thousands of others, including the familiar Times Roman. Something had to hold all this together, and until the late 15th century, covers consisted of either wood, or sheets of paper pasted together. These would eventually be replaced by rope fiber millboard, originally intended for high quality bindings in the late 17th century, but later as a less expensive option. And while today's mass produced cover illustrations are marketing tools, the cover designs of early books  were made to order. Even spines have a history. Initially, they were not considered aesthetically important, and the earliest ones were flat, rather than rounded. The flat form made the books easier to read by allowing the book to rest easily on a table. But those spines were damaged easily from the stresses of normal use. A rounded form solved that issue, although new problems arose, like having the book close in on itself. But flexibility was more important, especially for the on-the-go reader. As the book evolves and we replace bound texts with flat screens and electronic ink, are these objects and files really books? Does the feel of the cover or the smell of the paper add something crucial to the experience? Or does the magic live only within the words, no matter what their presentation? "
407,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,_rJOSDgDG0A,"The universe is bustling with matter and energy. Even in the vast apparent emptiness of intergalactic space, there's one hydrogen atom per cubic meter. That's not the mention a barrage of particles and electromagnetic radiation passing every which way from stars, galaxies, and into black holes. There's even radiation left over from the Big Bang. So is there such thing as a total absence of everything? This isn't just a thought experiment. Empty spaces, or vacuums, are incredibly useful. Inside our homes,  most vacuum cleaners work by using a fan to create a low-pressure relatively empty area that sucks matter in to fill the void. But that's far from empty. There's still plenty of matter bouncing around. Manufacturers rely on more thorough, sealed vacuums for all sorts of purposes. That includes vacuum-packed food that stays fresh longer, and the vacuums inside early light bulbs that protected filaments from degrading. These vacuums are generally created with some version of what a vacuum cleaner does using high-powered pumps that create enough suction to remove as many stray atoms as possible. But the best of these industrial processes tends to leave hundreds of millions of atoms per cubic centimeter of space. That isn't empty enough for scientists who work on experiments, like the Large Hadron Collider, where particle beams need to circulate at close to the speed of light for up to ten hours without hitting any stray atoms. So how do they create a vacuum? The LHC's pipes are made of materials, like stainless steel, that don't release any  of their own molecules and are lined with a special coating to absorb stray gases. Raising the temperature  to 200 degrees Celsius burns off any moisture, and hundreds of vacuum pumps take two weeks to trap enough gas and debris out of the pipes for the collider's incredibly sensitive experiments. Even with all this, the Large Hadron Collider isn't a perfect vacuum. In the emptiest places, there are still about 100,000 particles per cubic centimeter. But let's say an experiment like that could somehow get every last atom out. There's still an unfathomably huge amount of radiation all around us that can pass right through the walls. Every second, about 50 muons from cosmic rays, 10 million neutrinos coming directly from the Big Bang, 30 million photons from the cosmic microwave background, and 300 trillion neutrinos from the Sun pass through your body. It is possible to shield vacuum chambers with substances, including water, that absorb and reflect this radiation, except for neutrinos. Let's say you've somehow removed all of the atoms and blocked all of the radiation. Is the space now totally empty? Actually, no. All space is filled with what  physicists call quantum fields. What we think of as subatomic particles, electrons and photons and their relatives, are actually vibrations in a quantum fabric that extends throughout the universe. And because of a physical law called the Heisenberg Principle, these fields never stop oscillating, even without any particles to set off the ripples. They always have some minimum fluctuation called a vacuum fluctuation. This means they have energy, a huge amount of it. Because Einstein's equations tell us that mass and energy are equivalent, the quantum fluctuations in every cubic meter of space have an energy that corresponds to a mass of about four protons. In other words, the seemingly empty space inside your vacuum would actually weigh a small amount. Quantum fluctuations have existed since the earliest moments of the universe. In the moments after the Big Bang, as the universe expanded, they were amplified and stretched out to cosmic scales. Cosmologists believe that these original quantum fluctuations were the seeds of everything we see today: galaxies and the entire large scale structure of the universe, as well as planets and solar systems. They're also the center of one of the greatest scientific mysteries of our time because according to the current theories, the quantum fluctuations in the vacuum of space ought to have 120 orders of magnitude more energy than we observe. Solving the mystery of that missing energy may entirely rewrite our understanding of physics and the universe. "
408,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,a1WmidFwFzY,"Dead of night, Glenrowan, Australia, constable Hugh Bracken lies tossing in bed. Fever runs through him. He begins to drift off, when a sudden banging jars him awake. Somebody's at the door. He can barely think straight, but he stumbles slowly to unlock it. The second he does, the door slams open. A giant man in metal armor  pushes through, and puts a gun to the police officer's head. A voice echoes from inside  the tall helmet: ""I'm Ned Kelly. Bail up, or you're a dead man."" ♪ ""I am Ned Kelly."" For years, those words struck fear into the hearts of everybody living in the Australian colony of Victoria. Fear, and a little excitement. Newspapers filled up with shocking details about his crimes, eager gossip  from those who met him, and abject scorn for the police force which failed to catch so much as a glimpse  of him over a multi-year manhunt, that cost the government's thousands  of pounds and manpower and equipment. Rogue or hero, murderer or angel of vengeance, He was then, and still is today, a divisive figure in the Australian landscape. To some,  he was a brave warrior, standing up to a corrupt police force that served only to protect a rigged financial system. To others, he was  no more than a murderer, who endangered the lives of innocence  in his reckless quest for revenge. As for Ned Kelly, he wanted people to listen to his story, and judge for themselves. He said: ""I do not pretend to have led a blameless life, or that one fault justifies another, but the public in judging a case like mine should remember, that the darkest life may have a bright side."" So, let's hear his story. May of 1865, six children huddled next to their mother, and watched the police constable  clap handcuffs on to their father, John Kelly before leading him away. The biting winds that swept  across their barren farm soon forced the family  to retreat inside for warmth. All except the eldest boy, Ned. He stayed and watched  until the policeman led his father out of sight. Ned loved his father, he was proud of him as only  a child can be. He saw the good John Kelly, whom everybody called ""Red"", for obvious reasons. Red had stolen pigs to feed his brothers and sisters back in Ireland, and for his crime,  he'd been transported to Australia. He had served his time in an Australian labor camp, married a vivacious Irish girl named Ellen, and did his best to scratch out a living for his ever-growing young family. But Red's best was never good enough. His business ventures fell through, his farmland proved rocky and untenable, and the city that he'd staked his hopes on became a ghost town as the Australian Gold Rush left it behind. Faced with the same pressure that had driven him to steal food for his family back in Ireland, Red did it again, and was caught again. That was the day Ned watched his father walk away in handcuffs. A few days later, Red was sentenced to six months hard labor. And so, at 11 years old, Ned suddenly became the man of the house. He dropped out of school, and took on the role with vigor, determined to make his father proud. He looked after his pregnant mother, he tended the farm and the house as best he could. One day, on his way to town to pick up a few things, disaster nearly strikes. A seven-year-old boy, daydreaming on his way to school, drops his hat into the recently flooded river. When he reaches down to retrieve it, he falls. The river sweeps him away, and the only other person in sight, is Ned Kelly. Ned doesn't lose a second, he races down to the river and jumps in. He barely knows how to swim, but he's big for his age, made strong by his work on the farm, and he throws himself into the current. Through sheer determination, Ned catches the boy. He pulls him back to shore, then he leads him, soaked and shivering, back home. The boy's parents shower Ned with gratitude. They even arrange a small ceremony where they present him with a broad green silk sash with shining gold tassels, the colors of Ireland. It is the finest piece of cloth Ned has ever touched. And when they drape it over his shoulders and call him a hero, he nearly bursts with pride. Ned would wear his trophy for weeks, inviting everybody he knew to touch it, and hear the story of how brave he'd been. And best of all, wouldn't his father be proud? Red Kelly was proud. Proud, but no longer the man he had once been. The spark of determination had faded from his eyes. When he finally returned from his sentence of hard labor, he was a broken man, who could only get through his days by drinking. Over the next year, Ned watched his father rot away. And finally died from a failing liver in 1866, living just long enough to spend one final Christmas with his family, only to die before the new year. It was then that Ellen Kelly, Ned's mother, took matters into her own hands. Now a widow with seven children, she had no family nearby, except for a quarrelsome sister-in-law. But to the northeast, she had two sisters of her own, that also needed someone to lean on. Both of their husbands still lived, but had been imprisoned for cattle stealing. So Ellen joined forces with them in the small town of Greta. Bit by bit, she saved up enough to rent her family a new house. It went cheap, because nobody else wanted it, but to the dirt-poor Kelly family, anything would do. Ned threw all of his energy into making a real farm out of it, but all he got for his trouble was blistered and tired. The only money he could squeeze out of it was chopping up trees for firewood and selling them in town, ...and not for very much. His family depended on him, and didn't know what he could do. Enter Harry Power. Harry Power was a bushranger, the last of a dying breed of Australian outlaws and highwayman, whose adventures always seemed so grand and romantic, up until the moment they got caught. Power had escaped from the same prison where Ned's uncles, the cattle thieves, had been locked up, and it was on their recommendation that he made his way to Greta, and met Ned Kelly. What stories he told! He'd swept his way northeast on a whirlwind of robberies, rolling up as much as 87 pounds in a single day. Ned had never seen that much money in his life. He shook hands with Power, and agreed to become his apprentice. Unfortunately, Power's grand criminal stories were a wee-bit exaggerated. Oh he had robbed his way through the north, sure enough, but he neglected to mention that he was actually pretty new at this bushranging thing himself. The prison sentence that he'd escaped had been for horse thieving, not for robbing real live people. And once he'd made his escape, a few months before they would have let him out anyway, Harry Power had looked around and thought: ""Welp, I'm hanged if they catch me now, might as well go bushrager I guess."" Thus began Harry Power's story career. He proceeded to rob people by shouting loudly and waving his gun around, but he never actually shot anyone. In fact, two of his would-be victims had actually captured him, but Power convinced them to let him go. Not exactly a master criminal. So it's not much surprised that his first scheme, stealing fresh horses from one of the richest and the most powerful men in the area, doesn't go quite as planned. Or maybe it's more like the planning itself doesn't go well. Power leads his new apprentice to a rocky bluff that overlooks the rich man's paddock, and they survey the land in preparation for a raid. One tiny problem: they're in plain sight, and they get seen. While they lie there, planning to steal them some horses, the owner saddles one of the horses they aren't watching, sneaks up around them, and fires a warning shot at Ned. The bullet drives into the ground inches in front of Ned's nose, sending a spray of gravel into the boy's face. He screams, flattening himself like a pancake, and starts gibbering about a surrender. Ned is not exactly a master criminal either at this point. But Harry Power refuses to leave him behind. If he lets anything happen to that boy, Ellen Kelly will straight-up murder him. Cursing and hitting, he hauls Ned back on his feet, and pulls him away before their pursuer can load and fire again. They run back to the horses they brought with them, not as good as the horses they were planning to steal, but, good enough if you're desperate, and willing to ride at breakneck speed... which they are. They gallop across rough and rocky territory that would've killed any lesser horseman. But whatever their shortcomings, neither of them is a lesser horseman. Ned races all the way home, leaps off his horse, and vows never to go bushranging again. Join us next time as Ned goes bushranging again. "
409,Education,27,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,a9ottUEiIm8,"It’s March 21, 1955, and the Sarge is really @(#$* mad. But how do we we know that this means )#@$%(? Using a line of symbols to show obscenity is an established idea today, but it’s as old as the early 1900s, when an entirely new visual language was being invented. This is Beetle Bailey cartoonist Mort Walker, and in addition to making soldiers say stuff like !(@!@#(*, he coined the term “grawlixes” for the obscenity symbols, in an essay published for comic artists and later anthologized. Other comic conventions include plewds — little sweat drops; Briffits - dust clouds when a character disappears; and emanata — lines showing shock. But Walker made a list of tropes — not an origin story. For that, you’ve got to go back to the turn of the !)@@!)$ century. This is the madhouse of comics in 1896. What we think of as comics basically started with Hogan’s Alley, and later The Yellow Kid a spin-off centered on the !@#$@# freakshow @#$*( (@!*#$ 8@@@! Irish-American urchin Mickey Dugan (this is him watching a cockfight). Comics were experimental. Panels sometimes had to be numbered so you knew the order to read them in, and dialogue rarely appeared in speech bubbles. Sometimes words showed up on the Yellow Kid. Two comics pushed that innovation to the next level and invented a lot of what we know today - probably including grawlixes. The Katzenjammer Kids made a paneled story mainstream, showing some naughty little @()#*$s who always got spanked. Katzenjammer’s innovations included consistent speech bubbles and in the next couple of years, emanata indicating motion and maybe even swears. Lady Bountiful, a comic about a rich lady who tried to help some urchins — notice an urchin theme here? — joined in this idiomatic arms race. She also had speech bubbles while other comics still used captions. Those speech bubbles were more visceral than captions. They could show music and weird stuff like ideas, and this - the first known grawlix. Now it’s hard to be certain that this really was the first grawlix. But suddenly in 1902 and 1903, there were a @!@$$$ ton of them, and only a few comics were innovative enough to employ the new device. In December 1902, the Katzenjammer kids joined in with Lady B. These trailblazing comics established how you talk in comics with speech bubbles, and with the grawlix, they established how you showed you just don’t give a !@#()!!. This is a 1 kiloherz sine wave. You might not recognize it. But it sounds like this. It solves a problem and creates a feeling. Just like the grawlix. It’s the fun of transgression and the punishment, all in one smush of symbols. Sure, Sarge gets mad at Beetle for breaking the rules. But Beetle, that little !@(#* !*@#( little @#($*@#($* skinny *@#$(*!)@ son of a ()@#()$*@ kind of *@(#$*(@#*$. Sarge loves him, too. Hey, what’s up @#)$*(@(#? Two things. First, if you’re interested in language nerdery like this, check out Language Log and the writing of Ben Zimmer. Both of those were instrumental in early research on the grawlix and it helped us get our start. However, I do not wanna brag here, but we did find some early grawlixes that are even earlier than the previously known ones. If you want to learn about the research process for something as weird as a grawlix, Vox has a membership program called the Vox Video Lab where there are a ton of extra videos and information. In the Videolab, I have made a video about my research process and exactly how I nerded out over these 1900s comics and found a ton of ()@#*$* grawlixes.

410,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,aMCDikASE4o,"Take a moment to think about the US Constitution. What's the first thing that comes to mind? Freedom of speech? Protection from illegal searches? The right to keep and bear arms? These passages are cited so often that we can hardly imagine the document without them, but that's exactly what the writers of the Constitution did. The list of individual freedoms known as the Bill of Rights was not in the original text and wasn't added for another three years. So does this mean the founders didn't consider them? The answer goes back to the very origins of the Constitution itself. Even prior to the first shots of the American Revolution, the Thirteen Colonies worked together through a provisional government called the Continental Congress. During the war in 1781, the Articles of Confederation  were ratified as the first truly national government. But establishing a new nation would prove easier than running it. Congress had no power to make the states comply with their laws. When the national government proved unable to raise funds, enforce foreign treaties, or suppress rebellions, it was clear reform was needed. So in May 1787, all the states but Rhode Island sent delegates to Philidelphia for a constitutional convention. A majority of these delegates favored introducing a new national constitution to create a stronger federal government. Thanks to compromises on issues like state representation, taxation power, and how to elect the president, their proposal gradually gained support. But the final text drafted in September still had to be approved by conventions held in the states. So over the next few months, ratification would be debated across the young nation. Among those who championed the new document were leading statesmen Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay. Together, they laid out eloquent philosophical arguments for their positions in a series of 85 essays now known as the Federalist Papers. But others felt the Constitution was overreaching and that more centralized authority would return the states to the sort of tyranny they had just escaped. These Anti-Federalists were especially worried by the text's apparent lack of protections for individual liberties. As the conventions proceeded, many of these critics shifted from opposing the Constitution entirely to insisting on adding an explicit declaration of rights. So what was the Federalists problem with this idea? While their opponents accused them of despotism, wanting to maintain absolute power in the central government, their real motives were mostly practical. Changing the constitution when it had already been ratified by some states could complicate the entire process. More importantly, Madison felt that people's rights were already guaranteed through the democratic process, while adding extra provisions risked misinterpretation. And some feared that creating an explicit list of things the government can't do would imply that it can do everything else. After the first five states ratified the Constitution quickly, the debate grew more intense. Massachusetts and several other states would only ratify if they could propose their own amendments for consideration. Leading Federalists recognized the need to compromise and promised to give them due regard. Once ratification by nine states finally brought the Constitution into legal force, they made good on their promise. During a meeting of  the first United States Congress, representative James Madison stood on the House floor to propose the very amendments he had previously believed to be unnecessary. After much debate and revision, first in the Congress, and then in the states, ten amendments were ratified on December 15, 1791, over three years after the US Constitution had become law. Today, every sentence, word, and punctuation mark in the Bill of RIghts is still considered fundamental to the freedoms Americans enjoy, even though the original framers left them out. "
411,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,aQbyVYUob1o,"On the coast of Northern Ireland, a vast plateau of basalt slabs and columns called the Giant’s Causeway stretches into the ocean. The scientific explanation for this is that it’s the result of molten lava contracting and fracturing as it cooled in the wake of a volcanic eruption. But an ancient Irish myth  has a different accounting. According to legend, the giant Finn MacCool lived happily on the North Antrim coast with his wife Oonagh. Their only disturbance came from the taunts and threats of the giant Benandonner, or the red man, who lived across the sea in Scotland. The two roared insults and hurled rocks at each other in dramatic shows of strength. Once, Finn tore up a great clump of land  and heaved it at his rival, but it fell short of reaching land. Instead, the clump became the Isle of Man, and the crater left from the disturbed earth filled with water to become Lough Neagh. The giants’ tough talk continued, until one day Benandonner challenged  Finn to a fight, face to face. And so the Irish giant tossed  enough boulders into the sea to create a bridge of stepping  stones to the Scottish coast. Finn marched across in a fit of rage. When Scotland loomed before him, he made out the figure  of Benandonner from afar. Finn was a substantial size, but at the sight of his colossal enemy thundering towards him, his courage faltered. With one look at Benandonner’s thick neck and crushing fists, Finn turned and ran. Back home, with Benandonner fast approaching, Finn trembled as he described  his enemy’s bulk to Oonagh. They knew that if he faced  Benandonner head on, he’d be crushed. And so Oonagh hatched a cunning plan - they needed to create an illusion of size, to suggest Finn was a mountain of a man whilst keeping him out of sight. As Benandonner neared the end of the bridge, Oonagh stuffed her husband  in a huge cradle. Disguised as an enormous baby, Finn lay quiet as Benandonnner pounded on the door. The house shook as he stepped inside. Oonagh told the enraged visitor  that her husband wasn’t home, but welcomed him to sit and eat while he waited. When Benandonner tore into the cakes  placed before him, he cried out in pain for he’d shattered his teeth  on the metal Oonagh had concealed inside. She told him that this  was Finn’s favorite bread, sowing a seed of doubt in Benandonner’s mind that he was any match for his rival. When Finn let out a squawk, Benandonner’s attention was drawn to the gigantic baby in the corner. So hefty was the infant swaddled under piles of blankets, Benandonner shuddered at the thought of what the father would look like. He decided he’d rather not find out. As he fled, Benandonner tore up the rocks  connecting the shores, breaking up the causeway. What remains are two identical  rock formations: one on the North Antrim coast of Ireland and one at Fingal’s Cave in Scotland, right across the sea. "
412,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,a_1IpUCUuVc,"Last time, we left off with Robert Walpole seeing an incredible opportunity in the collapse of the South Sea company, and trying to maintain the very delicate balance between being the incorruptible hero of the people who opposed all this market madness, and pulling the strings behind the scenes just right so that the only horrible corruption that actually got exposed was that of the people who stood between him, and being Prime Minister Unfortunately for him, there was about to be a wrench thrown in the works. You see, Robert Knight was the cashier of the South Sea Company, and he had secretly been keeping a record of all of the company’s transactions, including a list of everyone they’d bribed. If this list fell into the hands of anyone with honest intent, it would bring down most of the political establishment of Britain and ruin Walpole's chance at power. Now, you'd think at this point, the government would just raid the South Sea offices, confiscate everything,including this ledger, and take all the principle actors into custody. But instead, they began to debate how to form a committee to investigate South Sea which is probably partly due to a lot of prodding from Walpole. This gave Robert Knight time to cook the books, adding legions of phony names to hide just how badly they'd overstepped the government's strictures on what could be lent to whom but perhaps more importantly, it gave him time to move the ledger, with its list of who they'd bribed still intact, from the company's files into his own personal possession. Finally, though, the government got their act together and called Knight in front of the committee to investigate just what exactly went on at South Sea. This left him with, as one of my favorite commentators on the period put it, three options: tell them nothing, which would leave him in prison for a very long time; tell them everything, which would certainly bring down the government and probably put him on a lot of people's short lists for a very untimely, very bloody accident; or, as soon as the day's questioning was over, walk out the door, grab the first coach for Dover and hop a ship across the channel. Needless to say, he chose option three. Because this was the government and no one was working on weekends, nobody realized he was gone until the following Monday. With such a head start, he wound his way through France and ended up in Brussels, conveniently part of the Austrian Netherlands, one of the few countries in western Europe without an extradition treaty with Great Britain. But, somehow, and by ‘somehow’ I mean ‘almost certainly with the help of certain members of government', Knight had managed to transfer most of his money overseas well before he absconded with a certain, extremely-implicating list of names, so he wasn’t exactly inconspicuous as he traveled, living the high life and putting himself up in the most expensive hotel in Brussels. The local British chargé d'affaires , who wasn’t wrapped up in all the machinations from back home, took notice of Knight’s extravagance and, per the official instructions of his government and the public statements made by Walpole, went to have Knight arrested. Of course, this was actually the absolute last thing that Walpole, the King or any of the Whig elite wanted to happen, and, at the last moment, somebody tipped Knight off... it was Walpole... Walpole tipped Knight off. and he attempted to flee again. But this time, he was caught by our industrious chargé d'affaires just before he could slip across the border. He was carted off to a prison in Antwerp,  and as news reached England, Walpole, the King, and the Whig elite publically celebrated and demanded his immediate return. Oddly enough, for some reason, Knight’s ledger never made it to prison with him. 'who' knows where that went... it was Walpole... Meanwhile, back in Britain, Blunt came to the realization that, with Knight on the lam, he himself was just about the only person still around who knew just who South Sea had bribed. Unlike Knight, though, Blunt had far fewer compunctions about selling out his former business partners, so he promptly began selling out whomever he could in exchange for a deal. He only squealed to the committee from the House of Commons, though, leaving the House of Lords completely in the dark. He knew which people he was likely to get a better deal from. This threw everything into chaos, and chaos just happened to be something Walpole could make good use of. On top of this, since no one had that dangerous ledger anymore, Blunt was just working from memory and, in a stroke of great fortune, the names that Blunt could remember happened line up remarkably well with the list of people that Walpole needed to get rid of. But there was still the threat of Robert Knight’s far better memory, which was currently sitting in a jail cell in Antwerp. With the public angrily clambering for his return and those MP's who weren't involved in the scandal demanding continuously and publicly to be able to question him, the King was forced to bring Knight back. But, since Britain had no extradition treaty with the Austrian Netherlands, the King couldn’t just haul him back. Instead he dispatched a man to go  “convince” the Austrian government to send Knight back to England for trial. The particular fellow chosen to do the convincing was a bit of an odd choice,  as he had never performed diplomatic service before and, in fact, had no obvious qualifications for the job other than that he was a close friend of Walpole's. Secretly, this fellow had instructions to convince the Austrians that ‘On no condition should they return Knight to Britain. Ever. Please. In fact, if they could just let him escape, that would be awesome. Walpole then also sent two letters to the Austrians. One of the letters demanded vociferously that Knight be returned. The other, which is one of the most extraordinary diplomatic documents I've ever read pretty much explicitly offered the Austrians a blank check as far as the British were concerned so long as Knight never came back to Britain. This is the point where history needs a Benny Hill theme. Parliament wanted Robert Knight back in Britain. Walpole couldn’t have him coming back. Parliament offered Knight a royal pardon if he’d return to England and give his testimony. In response, Walpole’s agents in Antwerp quietly told Knight that ‘even with such a pardon, Parliament could still prosecute him, 'Don’t you dare.’ Since the pardoning attempt fell through, sitting members of Parliament hopped on a boat boat to sail over to the Austrian Netherlands to question Knight personally, but the governor of the Netherlands, tipped off by Walpole, prevented them from entering the country. Then, Walpole convinced the Austrian government to move Knight to a different prison while still pretending he was in the original one so that any British MPs who happened to show up unannounced couldn’t question Knight without their knowing. When rumors started to circulate that Knight wasn’t in his original cell in Antwerp, they took him back to Antwerp, put him back in that cell, let someone verify he was there… and then in the middle of the night, took him out to the Arden forest and just let him go. No one would hear from him again for 20 years. With Knight safely out of the way, Walpole could finally let the hammer of justice come down without consequence for himself. And, as that justice hammer was being wielded by a parliamentary committee rather than by the courts, it meant that the guilty were basically trying themselves and Walpole’s now enormous influence could determine exactly where that hammer fell. Whig leaders like John Aislabie, along with along with notables like the Postmaster General, the First Lord of the Treasury nd the Lord of the Council, either resigned or were stripped of their positions, clearing the way for Walpole to become First Lord of the Treasury, a position he would use to become what most historians consider the first Prime Minister of England Many other individuals were fined, but very few served jail time, and even among those fined, very few lost more than they had made from the South Sea Bubble. And those who managed to remain in power all knew exactly who they had to thank: Robert Walpole. And Blunt?  Well, since he, unlike his associate Knight, was willing to name names, Blunt began trading for a deal on the people he’d bribed as soon as he could. In the end, he was left with 5000 pounds to his name, which is still probably more than he had at the beginning of this story. and hilariously, he remained a Baronet, a title he had been given for his good work with the South Sea company a few scant months earlier. In fact, his family holds the Blunt Baronet to this day. In the end, when we look back on all this madness, I think it’s important to remember that Britain couldn't have survived without financial institutions like the South Sea Company and the Bank of England. Without them, the government couldn’t have carried the debts it needed to prosecute its wars and keep the country afloat. But, without oversight, with politicians financially tied to the entities they were supposed to be responsible for reining in, and with the public good being guarded only by the very people who stood to profit from the public good being subverted, these institutions lead the national economy to the brink of ruin and left generations of the middle class to foot the bill. This is a good lesson. I hope we learn it someday. See you next time. Oh! And for any of you who are wondering what happened to Robert Knight after he ran off into the woods, years later he wound up in Paris, used the money he fled with to start a bank and did quite well for himself. Such is the heavy price of crashing a national economy… yep... see ya' next week! "

Not in the greeting card sense, in the scientific sense, where one part per million is a unit of measurement. Parts per million counts the number of units of one substance per one million units of another. It can measure concentrations when a small amount makes a big difference. For example, a concentration of just 35 ppm of carbon monoxide in the air is poisonous to us. We encounter measurements like this pretty often, but because it's hard to conceptualize really large numbers, it's difficult to wrap our brain around what one part per million really means. So here are nine helpful ways to visualize it. If you had 11,363 pianos-worth of piano keys, one of those keys would be about one part per million. So would a single granule of sugar among 273 sugar cubes, one second in eleven and a half days, or four dots in the painting, ""A Sunday Afternoon on  the Island of La Grande Jatte."" Your bath tub's capacity  is about 60 gallons, so seven drops of ink would be one part per million. The English version of the Harry Potter series has 1,084,170 words, which makes ""hippogriff"" on page 221 of ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" a little less than one part per million. A million kernels of corn  is about 1,250 ears, so one kernel in that truckload would be one part per million. There are 10 million bricks in the Empire State Building, so one part per million  would be a pile of just ten. And finally, 100 people worked together to animate this video. Collectively, they have about 10 million hairs on their heads. Pluck ten of those hairs, and you have one in a million. "
414,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,arlTwhiMxVM,"Before the world of humans began, there was the world of the gods, made of fields, plains and gardens. Four brothers wandered this celestial realm. They had no family other  than each other— they didn’t even know who  their parents were. One of the brothers, Deminan, looked different from the others. His skin was covered in painful scabs, and he wondered why he alone had  been marked with this affliction. One day, while the supreme spirit  Yaya was out in his gardens, Deminan and his brothers snuck  into Yaya’s house. After feasting and exploring, they spotted a giant gourd hanging in the corner. But as they tried to look inside  the gourd, they dropped it. The gourd broke apart, releasing a deluge  that swept the brothers away, separating them from the  celestial lands forever. The waters from the gourd formed a new world. This realm was covered in seas, which didn’t exist in the gods’ world. The waters were full of fish and other creatures, and dotted with islands and caves. This world of seas was also cut off  completely from the celestial realm, and the brothers wandered aimlessly, even more lost than they had been before. One day, three of the brothers  stumbled upon a house. In the house lived an elder named  Bayamanacao, and he invited them in. When Deminan caught up slightly later,  he followed them into the house. Bayamanacao told the brothers  he was their grandfather and gave them a gift of special  cassava bread. He revealed their family lineage to them: their mother had been the Earth Mother  Goddess Itibi Cahubaba and had died when they were born. The brothers were grateful for his hospitality and insight into their past. But then Bayamanacao turned on Deminan, blowing tobacco spittle from his nose  onto Deminan’s back. The spot where the spittle landed  immediately began to swell and sting. Soon Deminan was delirious and his back was so swollen his brothers feared he would die. Not knowing what else to do, they cut open the welt. A turtle emerged from the  wound and swam away, alternating easily between sea  and land as she went. When Deminan recovered from his delirium, he finally understood what the curse of his disease meant: he was a caracaracol, able to communicate with the gods. He was the link between the celestial realm and the earthly realm. Deminan was the first in a long lineage of caracaracols. The world of seas he and his brothers had created when they dropped the gourd became the world of humans, where the caracaracols who followed  Deminan maintained the delicate balance between people and gods. But their unique power came at a price: Deminan and all the caracaracols  who followed him continued to suffer from the illness that  had first marked Deminan as special. Represented in Taino carvings  and figurines with a swollen back and emaciated arms, the caracaracol is both cursed and blessed to be a conduit between worlds. "
415,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,axBuiB55CfA,"After breaking Ethic out of prison, Hedge flies them both towards a frontier settlement in the shadow of the Bradbarrier, the great wall that encircles the nation. All the settlers there will soon gather  for the monthly feeding. The people of the wall spend their days gathering up works of art and literature, from all across the land. On feeding day, the furnace-bots arrive,  ravenous. If they eat, the lights stay on,  and the food gets delivered. If they starve, the people do too. Hedge’s fuel supply runs out just as he and Ethic reach the outskirts of town, and they come in for a crash landing. Luckily, everyone is too busy preparing  for the feeding to notice. Today’s feeding is where Ethic  can find the leader of an underground resistance movement. This person knows the location of the first of three powerful artifacts. The problem is, Hedge and  Ethic don’t know the resistance leader’s name  or appearance. But Hedge has gathered the following information: The leader has green eyes. If the leader has red hair, their name has at least one consecutive double letter. If the leader wear glasses, their name has exactly 2 vowels. Otherwise, their name has  exactly 3 vowels. There is exactly one person for whom  these are all true. As a fugitive, Ethic can’t sneak into the crowd without  drawing attention to herself. But she can give instructions to Hedge. And one tool she has is what programmers call a conditional. That’s a statement of the form  “If A, then B.” Flowcharts are great illustrations  of how those work. This conditional translates to:  if A is true, carry out instruction B. There are also conditionals that account  for different possibilities. This says, “If A is true, perform  instruction B. Otherwise, carry out instruction C.” So what instructions does she give Hedge so he can find the resistance leader? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. With a problem like this,  it can help to simplify first. What if Hedge just has to examine  this one person? What information does he need  to collect about her? He might ask, “Does she have green eyes?” What other questions should Hedge ask to find the resistance leader, and how can he track those answers? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. It may seem intuitive how you’d approach  this problem as a human. But Hedge isn’t a human, and so the challenge comes from needing to give him systematic instructions that will work in any scenario. Hedge needs to examine the settlers,  one at a time, until he discovers the right person. In other words, like with the lock on the prison cell, this is a loop that repeats the  same instructions. Only this time the loop will involve  a series of questions in the form of conditionals, and will end as soon as Hedge  finds his target. But first, you’ll want to organize  your information. Each person has a set of characteristics: Eye color, hair color, glasses, and name. Does this person have green eyes? If so, mark a check next to “eye color.""  If not, mark an X there. If they have red hair, does their  name contain a double letter? If so, mark a check next to “hair color.” If they don’t have a double letter, mark an X next to “hair color.” Anyone with red hair and no double letter can’t be the resistance leader. But notice that if they have blue hair, Hedge will skip this question and  go on to the next one. For the last question, we can say, “If they wear glasses, does their name have exactly 2 vowels? If they don’t have glasses, does their name have exactly 3 vowels?” There will be people in the crowd with glasses and 1 vowel, or no glasses and 2 vowels. But they’re not who we’re looking for,  so they’ll get X’s. The resistance leader must be someone  with either check marks or blanks next to every question. Blanks are ok, because if someone has blue hair, the rule about red hair doesn’t  apply to them. You could have Hedge ask every question  about every person, and then choose the person with  only checks and blanks. But there’s a way to save yourself lots  of time: as soon as Hedge marks an X, have him move on to the next person. You don’t need to know the answer to every question; just one X means they’re not the target  of your search. Hedge buzzes through the crowd, and within minutes finds Adila, the resistance leader, and brings her back to Ethic. Adila agrees to help them steal the first  artifact— the node of power— but under one condition: that Ethic and Hedge jump-start  the revolution by reprogramming the furnace-bots  that terrorize the town. And right on cue, the robots descend. "
416,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ayzN5f3qN8g,"This might seem hard to believe, but right now, 300 million women across the planet  are experiencing the same thing: a period. The monthly menstrual cycle that leads to the period is a reality most women on Earth will go through in their lives. But why is this cycle so universal? And what makes it a cycle in the first place? Periods last anywhere between two and seven days, arising once within in a 28-day rotation. That whole system occurs on repeat, happening approximately 450 times during a woman's life. Behind the scenes are a series of hormonal controls that fine tune the body's internal workings to make menstruation start or stop during those 28 days. This inner machinery includes two ovaries stocked with thousands of tiny sacks called follicles that each contain one oocyte, an unfertilized egg cell. At puberty, ovaries hold  over 400 thousand egg cells, but release only one each month, which results in pregnancy or a period. Here's how this cycle unfolds. Each month beginning around puberty, the hormone-producing  pituitary gland in the brain starts releasing two substances  into the blood: follicle stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone. When they reach the ovaries, they encourage the internal egg cells to grow and mature. The follicles respond by pumping out estrogen. The egg cells grow  and estrogen levels peak, inhibiting the production of FSH, and telling the pituitary to pump out more LH. That causes only the most mature egg cell from one of the ovaries to burst out of the follicle and through the ovary wall. This is called ovulation, and it usually happens ten to sixteen days before the start of a period. The tiny oocyte moves  along the fallopian tube. A pregnancy can only occur if the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell within the next 24 hours. Otherwise, the egg's escapade ends, and the window for pregnancy  closes for that month. Meanwhile, the now empty follicle begins to release progesterone, another hormone that  tells the womb's lining to plump up with blood and nutrients in preparation for a fertilized egg that may embed there and grow. If it doesn't embed, a few days later, the body's progesterone and estrogen levels plummet, meaning the womb stops padding out and starts to degenerate, eventually falling away. Blood and tissue leave the body, forming the period. The womb can take up to a week to clear out its unused contents, after which, the cycle begins anew. Soon afterwards, the ovaries begin to secrete estrogen again, and the womb lining thickens, getting ready to accommodate  a fertilized egg or be shed. Hormones continually control these activities by circulating in ideal amounts delivered at just the right time. The cycle keeps on turning, transforming each day and each week into a milestone along its course towards pregnancy or a period. Although this cycle appears to move by clockwork, there's room for variation. Women and their bodies are unique,  after all. Menstrual cycles occur at diffferent times in the month, ovulation comes at various points in the cycle, and some periods last longer than others. Menstruation even begins and ends at different times in life for different women, too. In other words, variations between periods are normal. Appreciating these differences and learning about this monthly process can empower women, giving them the tools to understand and take charge of their own bodies. That way, they're able to factor this small cycle into a much larger cycle of life. "

He spends his time collecting stories about an island called Java. Mariners say it's ""the largest island in the world"", he writes, that it's subject to a great king and pays tribute to no one. People speak of its wealth and the spices it produces. Java's ports throng with merchants, and its treasure, they say, is beyond telling ""...and I can assure that the Great Khan could never get possession of this island"", he writes, ""on account of the great distance and the great expense of an expedition."" The stories Polo heard were exaggerated. Sumatra was in fact larger than Java, and the island didn't grow spice. It just controlled the trade routes, but he was right about one thing. The Great Khan should have left Java alone. [Extra History Theme] Three years earlier, An imperial envoy makes his case before the king of Singhasari: the greatest power on Java. The Great Khan, he says, has been monitoring conditions in this southern ocean. He'd watched as Singhasari had aggressively expanded, taking over Srivijaya's crumbling vassal empire to its east, and conquering Bali to its west. The Great Khan had seen how this sent the shipping lanes into disorder, and it had not escaped the Khan's attention that Singhasari had rebuffed his order to send royal captives to the Mongol Court, as any good vassal should. Now, he offered one last chance to comply. The king of Singhasari had seen this conflict brewing. For centuries, the archipelago's kingdoms had sent trade missions carrying spices, resins and fine wood to the Chinese emperor, who then sent back gifts of porcelain and silk. The Chinese had always called these ""tributes"", since the imperial throne did not engage in anything as crass as 'trade'. As the states of Southeast Asia had gone along with it, China could call the trade whatever it wanted, as long as the ships kept coming. Once the Mongols began rampaging through China, and that ""tribute"" system broke down, the archipelago began a much more direct trade with Chinese merchants. Now, these new Mongol emperors wanted to make Singhasari a true vassal. But Singhasari was a power on the rise. Their King had built a miniature empire, and controlled the spice for cotton trade with India. He'd even been inducted into the mystic Himalayan School of tantric Buddhism, that Kubla Khan himself practised. The king of Singhasari may have in fact done so in preparation for a conflict, wanting to be the spiritual equal of the Khan, and know what mystical powers he could call upon, Singhasari was no vassal and would not be treated as one. When the envoy presented himself at the imperial court, the Emperor knew that the mission had failed. He could read it on the man's face, because the king of Singhasari had cut off his ears. Or his nose. Or maybe just branded or tattooed him. The record isn't clear, but one thing was for certain: Kubla Khan swore Singhasari would pay for this loss of face. In 1292 the khan's great fleet arrived off Java. It had 1,000 ships, 20,000 soldiers, and orders to destroy Singhasari. They would remove the King from his throne, and find a more ... pliant ruler. Yet upon arrival, they found the job already half done. The fleet's envoy returned to say that the king was dead. In the three years since the imperial envoy's visit, the neighboring kingdom of Kediri had risen up and captured the capital. There was no longer a Singhasari. Now the king of Kediri ruled Java. But this fleet had been sent to bring the king of Java to heel, and they couldn't come back empty-handed. If Singhasari was gone, Kediri would have to do. The fleet easily captured the unprepared Kediri Navy, as it assembled at the mouth of a river. Then, the great ships began to unload their famous Mongol troops, and push into the heart of Java. And that's when they got a message. A very strange message. It claimed to be from the rightful heir to the throne of Singhasari. The sender, Raden Vijaya, was the dead king's stepson, and the blood of his ancestor, the founder of Singhasari, and avatar of the god Vishnu ran strong in his veins. But he was besieged in his new capital by the armies of the Kediri. If the Chinese would help restore him to his throne, He would happily pay tribute to the Great Khan, and become his willing vassal. It was an odd proposition to put their original targets heir on the throne, sure. But eminently practical. They needed to install a vassal ruler, and here one was. So they took the deal moving on the capital of Kediri, with Raden Vijaya's troops as their rearguard. But one thing about Vijaya: In Indonesian folklore there are two kinds of rulers. There's the 'righteous prince', a mystic messianic figure that arises to save Java in its time of need. These figures were devout, steadfast, and morally upright. Then there are the Jago (mispronunciation: should be with strong ""j""). The fighting cock. Jago are scrappy upstarts. They're rebels and gangsters; people who are resourceful, cunning, and effective but never to be trusted. Wijaya's ancestor, the founder of Singhasari, had been a Jago. Legend said he'd once been the greatest thief in Java; A man who used theft, flattery and guile to go from impoverished orphan to usurper of a dynasty. And Vijaya was a fitting successor to that legacy. When Singhasari fell, he'd been up north with the army, crushing a rebellion. While there, he'd received word that the king of Kediri had forced the capital. His father-in-law had died surrounded by mandalas and ritual objects, attempting to save his kingdom through mystic ceremonies as the palace burned around him. But Vijaya had something better than a rituals to protect him. He had an army, and over the next year, he attacked the Kediri forces handing them three defeats. But these victories got him no closer to taking the capital. if he wanted to survive, he'd need to establish a base of operations, and wait for his moment. So he approached a prince who supported the Kediri rebellion asking for refuge in exchange for submission. The prince, who figured allying with Vijaya might be a smart bet in the long term, agreed. Wijaya settled on the Brantas river, a place between the island's largest port, and its inland rice terraces. When he arrived, one of his followers plucked a fruit from a tree. After tasting it, the man threw it away, complaining that it was bitter. Vijaya decided that would be the name of his new capital. Bitter fruit. Majapahit. Now that the Mongols were here, the waiting was over. His chance had arrived. He led the Mongol armies' rearguard as they battered their way into the Kediri capital. They captured the usurper, took his family hostage, and broke his army. The Mongols had done their part Now it was Vijaya's turn to hold up the bargain, and of course he was happy to pay the tribute as agreed. Oh, but hey, uh, one little thing. His Treasury was back in Majapahit, of course. If they could lend him an escort, he could lead them straight to their reward. Vijaya was, of course, being polite. These escorts were prison guards, not honor guards. He was a captive and had little choice, and so he led them back to his new lands of Majapahit. ...and straight into an ambush :D The army of Singhasari - now Majapahit annihilated the Mongols, who weren't so formidable without their horses. Afterward, Wijaya took his troops into the jungles and rice terraces, engaging the Chinese in a hit-and-run guerrilla war. Which was not great, as far as the Chinese commanders were concerned. Guerrilla wars take time, and they weren't supposed to start an occupation. Their orders had been to destroy a kingdom, and they had done that. Sure, it was the wrong Kingdom, but, whatever. Check. And they'd taken royal hostages from ... a family no longer in power, granted, But let's call that a check. They'd installed a new ruler. Which, okay, it WAS the heir to the guy they were supposed to remove, But, you know what? Check. Good job, everyone. Roll out that mission accomplished banner, and let's go! And so the Great Khan's punitive expedition dropped sail, and left. Chinese fleets would be absent from the archipelago for the rest of the Yuan Dynasty. And meanwhile Raden Vijaya sat in a new palace. Heir to his father-in-law's project to expand and strengthen Javanese power, a new empire was on the rise: the empire of Majapahit. "
418,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,bmqLo75E86M," When Khosrau defeated Masdak and put down his brother's rebellion, the priests gave him a new name: Anushirawan, 'The immortal soul'. It was an honour that he intended to earn. Music (Birth of the People) Upon coming into his own, Khosrau burst into a fury of action nearly unparalleled in history. He reformed almost every aspect of the empire. Trying to fix those broken systems that had nearly doomed his father's reign, and guiding Iran into a new golden age. Both his and his father's successions had nearly been derailed by pressures on their army. It turns out that structuring your military as a single unified force means that it can only serve on one side of the empire at a time. And a single defeat, or even an over-commitment to a single border, could easily leave you scrambling for emergency funds to hire another army at the last minute. Khosrau planned to expand and restructure his military. But to do that he was going to need money. His father, who had recognised this same issue, had long ago begun a property survey of the entire empire, cataloguing what each citizen owned, and what they could afford to pay. But a survey that long takes forever, so it wasn't complete until Khosrau's time. Khosrau made use of this immediately. He levied new taxes that demanded a fixed amount based on wealth, asking the richest citizens to pay the most. He also required that taxes be paid with coin, and not with goods; he didn't need his farmer's perishable wheat, he needed gold. In the end, people ended up paying higher taxes than they used to, but their tax rate was now consistent year after year. No more panicked emergency levies. And now Khosrau could stockpile that non-perishable money for a rainy day. Next on the reform list was tax collection. For generations, the noble families had been responsible for both assessing and collecting taxes. But now that Khavadh's land survey had made their assessments irrelevant, Khosrau delivered the killing blow; by taking away their ability to collect taxes too. In their place, he created a new upper-middle class called the deghans, and appointed them as tax collectors who answered only to Khosrau and the priests. The nobles could no longer lie about how much their provinces generated, or skim off the top to line their own pockets at the expense of the Imperial treasury. Of course, the deghans eventually became corrupt in their own right, but Khosrau had succeeded where it mattered most to him; he took power away from the noble families and doubled revenues for his empire. Now flush with cash, Khosrau could finally afford his military overhaul. He split it into four divisions, one for each corner of the empire. Each division would be lead by its own general, and here Khosrau threw the noble families a bone by assigning them command. This was a sly power play too, though. Because he made sure that the nobles were never given command of an army in their home region, so they could never consolidate power against him. And where nobles had once been the only class allowed to serve as elite cavalry, Iran's most prestigious unit, Khosrau now allowed the deghans into that exclusive club. Khosrau had learned well from his father's reign. Kavadh had tried to go after the nobles directly, by embracing Mazdak, a mistake that nearly cost him the empire. Khosrau, on the other hand, had won the noble's favour by opposing Mazdak, before quietly rooting out their other sources of power and replacing them with the deghans, a loyal new social class of his own creation. The nobles still had influence, but not enough to threaten Khosrau the way Sukhra once threatened Kavadh. And with these reforms, the empire flourished. Khosrau built walls at the four key entrances to his empire, making it easier to defend against invaders on all sides. He built a better network of roads, so his armies could travel more quickly. And that network enticed even more merchants from China and India along the prosperous Silk Road. This influx of trade brought not only wealth but knowledge. Khosrau imported works on mathematics, astronomy and philosophy, from India on one side, and Rome on the other. Hoping to create a court of learning. Iran already had a long history of embracing education. 300 years before Khosrau, the founders of his own Sasanian dynasty had built a university, complete with state-funded scholarships, and the promise of safety and freedom to all who studied there. That promise lured refugee scholars from the Eastern Roman Empire, where Justinian had recently banned pagan teachings. Leaving the classical Greek scholars from the famous school of Athens with no where to go. Khosrau welcomed them to his own university with open arms. And they declared him worthy of the title, 'Plato's Philosopher King.' The title was nice, but sticking it to Justinian, even nicer. Khosrau took a genuine personal interest in education. He attended a medical conference at the university with physicians from around the world. And after listening to them, he decided to add a hospital to his university. The library he built for it consisted of 259 rooms filled with row upon row of medical texts translated into every language. But even that incredible library was not enough for Khosrau. He wanted to gather all the knowledge about Iran into one place. He urged his advisors to collect and write down their history going back to ancient times. Alas, this great collection would be lost several centuries later, but before it disappeared, it provided the basis for Iran's great national epic, the Shahnameh. And the Shahnameh's authour came from Khosrau's own deghan class, as the deghans would become the empire's leading class of scholars. But Khosrau wasn't done yet. The next great challenge would be an attempt to restore the sacred text of Iran's Zoroastrian religion. Even today, Zoroastrianism is one of the world's oldest active religions, with roots dating back at least as far as the fifth century BCE and probably a lot farther. The belief system taught by the prophet Zoroaster had originally been passed down through the oral tradition. At one point, those teachings were written down in a great collection known as the Avesta. But when Alexander the Great conquered Iran in 330BCE, he had burned down the old Shah's palace, and the Avesta with it. The oral tradition was all that remained. But in the centuries since that fire, many of Iran's great Shas had attempted to collect and re-record the Avesta from those oral accounts. Khosrau's predecessors had laid much of the groundwork, but he was determined to finish the job. He assigned his priests to review and rationalize their collection, organizing the scattered fragments into a master copy that set the standard for orthodox faith. Khosrau became a mirror for cultured behavior that upper-class Iranians were expected to follow. Schools for the education of young noblemen began teaching the sciences along with the courtly arts, like poetry and music. And best of all, Khosrau insisted that anyone who wanted respect in Iran become really, really good at board games. After visiting India in search of medical knowledge, one of Khosrau's university physicians had brought back the games chess and backgammon. Chess had been devised as a military strategy game, teaching players to manage an army in battle formation. Backgammon, on the other hand, quickly acquired new Iranian rules that reflected the random nature of fate in the Zoroastrianism belief system. Together, these games taught important lessons about how to control what you can, and accept what you can't. And it was through Iran, and Khosrau's ever-active trading network with Rome, that chess and backgammon travelled to the West and became the games we know today. All of these changes and reforms were a product of a lifetime for Khosrau, but he laid the foundation for them in the very first yeas of his rein. It was the perfect time. The Hephthalites were busy fending off Turks in the north. The Arabs had allied with Iran, and created a buffer zone to the south. And the Romans, under Justinian, had signed a treaty known as the eternal peace. With so few enemies to threaten him, Khosrau seized the opportunity, and proved himself worthy of the name Anushirawan. Which Iranians still know him by today. But the peace which allowed Khosrau to launch his empire of reforms would soon come to an end. Beligered Ostrogoth messengers stumbled into Iran across a Roman border opened by the treaty of eternal peace. They raced along the roads that Khosrau had recently rebuilt to beg for an audience with the Shah. And when the veils lifted to reveal Khosrau on his throne, the messengers spoke; ""Justinian has sent all his armies to attack us in the west. Please, help us."" Music (The Immortal Soul) "

When the triad strike force steps off the ferry, police meet them on the dock. Members of the revived China Society scatter, weaving through alleys, avoiding patrols; but as everyone flees, one man runs the other way.  Lu Haodong, the man who designed the flag these would-be revolutionaries fight under, is headed into Guangzhou. He'd nearly escaped before he remembered something. He crashes into the bookshop they'd used as a headquarters. No soldiers? Good. He rifles around until he finds what he's looking for: the membership book: a register of everyone who's joined or supported the revived China Society Lu hears footsteps on the street. No time. He strikes a match. The book is curled to ashes by the time the soldiers take him. Kobe, Japan Sun Yat-sen steps off the steamer, finally safe. When things went sideways, he'd gone to ground in a church, smuggling himself to Macau after dark. He booked passage to Kobe not because he had a plan, but because it was the first ship that was available. Things were bad. The revived China Society was dispersed, out of contact. He'd seen posters offering ten thousand taels of silver for his capture. And, Sun had been banned from Hong Kong. Worse than that, the Revolution had its first martyrs. The governor of Guangzhou had executed five revolutionaries, including Lu Haodong. Lu: one of Sun's oldest friends, who'd helped him deface that idol all those years ago. He'd refused to talk, even under torture. But when Sun picks up a newspaper, he's shocked. The press is calling the uprising a revolution, not a rebellion. He was a revolutionary. A fugitive revolutionary, he reminded himself, living in exile and he needed to change his appearance if he wanted to stay alive. He rented a room and cut off his queue. The act was symbolic as well as practical: the Qing mandated the hairstyle by law. He bought his first set of Western clothes, shaved his unkept on the run stubble down to a mustache, and slicked his hair back with pomade. He looks at himself, a changed man. One who could blend in on the streets of Japan, or disappear into the China towns of Hawaii, the United States, or Southeast Asia Which was good, because he'd be living as an exile, on the run for the next 16 years. London 1896 Nearly a year since the uprising. A very humbling year. Sun had done a tour across Hawaii and the United States, founding new chapters of the revived China society, and soliciting donations. It hadn't gone well. The failed uprising had made him toxic. He barely raised enough from one stop to reach the next. Overseas Chinese in America didn't seem to understand his ideas and were skeptical of whether revolution was even possible. Each meeting attracted one or two dozen people. The only bright spot was an invitation from one of his old medical professors from Hong Kong: Dr. James Cantlie, to visit him in London. For Sun, it was an opportunity to study the British Government, understand the workings of this colonial power, and learn more about economic theory. He saw the sights, and spent days at the British Museum library; devouring economic and social works unavailable in Asia. Each night, he dined with Cantlie, asking questions and refining his ideas. And as he did so, he never noticed: he was being followed. In fact, Qing agents had shadowed him since San Francisco, where he'd been careless enough to pose for a newspaper photograph. That photograph had been posted to every Chinese consulate in America, with agents tracking his every move. Indeed, the Chinese Legation in London had prepared for his arrival. They'd hired a British detective agency to pick up his tail at the dock, and within a week, they knew his movements. And it just so happened that the Chinese Legation was around the corner from Dr. Cantlie's house, on a route Sun walked every day. The order came through: Bring. Him. In. October 11th. A Sunday morning. Sun walks toward the Cantlies' house planning to accompany them to church when two Chinese men approach him They smile, happy to see another countryman. They invite him into their house for tea. Sun offers to come back another time. But, they're insistent. They take his arms and half jokingly pulled him into an open door. He follows. Only when they bar the door does he realize his mistake. An hour later, he's locked alone in a room. A man enters: an elderly British man with a big white beard. He informs Sun that this is the Chinese Legation. British law doesn't apply here, and they have orders to place him under arrest. They're currently awaiting further orders from Beijing .The white bearded man sits down, leaning on his cane. And the questioning begins. October 17 Sun begs the housekeeper to help him. For days, he's tried to bribe the Legation's English servants to carry messages to Cantlie. Each time, they took his money and threw his notes away. He'd tried writing pleas for help and throwing them out the window, but the room they kept him in overlooks a courtyard and the white bearded man simply collects the notes. The man had stopped questioning him. Days before, he informed Sun that the government had booked passage on a steamer. Sun would be returned to China for execution. Sun spent his days and nights praying for deliverance. But now, he's breaking through with the English housekeeper. He begs her to send word to Cantlie: ""His house is just around the corner, for pity's sake!"" 11:30 p.m Dr. Cantlie's doorbell rings, but when he goes downstairs to answer he only finds a note pushed under the door. He reads it: Sun's been kidnapped. This can't wait until tomorrow. Cantlie knows about Qing justice. Within hours, his favorite student could be gone. And Cantlie knows a man who can help: Sir Halliday Macartney He'd fought with the Qing during the Taiping rebellion, and has connections in the Chinese Government. His house isn't far. Cantlie rings the doorbell. It's the middle of the night. He starts rapping on windows trying to wake someone Squinting to see into the dark house. No one's home. Not Macartney's wife, or his servants, and especially not the white bearded Macartney himself. He was, after all, at the Chinese Legation interrogating Sun. At a loss, Cantlie goes to the local police station. But it's the middle of the night on a Saturday, the time when drunks wander in telling wild stories. They dismiss him. He rushes to Scotland Yard. They take a statement, and tell him to go home. He's at the Foreign Office the moment it opens. They demure. They fear taking public action would endanger British businesses in China. But, the bureaucratic gears begin to turn. Worried that Sun might be smuggled out before authorities act, Cantlie hires a private detective to watch the Legation. Exhausted, he finally goes home. Waiting for him is another employee from the Legation delivering a letter. It's from Sun in his own handwriting on the back of two of his business cards. Hard evidence. And from it, he learns that Sir Halliday Macartney is not a potential ally he Sun's jailer. If Macartney had been home, Cantlie's request for help might have signed his death warrant. And at the exact same time, Macartney is undergoing his own revelation. Unwittingly, Cantlie had hired the same detective agency the Legation had used to shadow Sun. The agency sends Macartney a message: Cantlie knows. It's too late to smuggle Sun out. Things are in motion. The next morning, The Foreign Office leans on Scotland Yard, and within hours the police have the Legation under 24-hour surveillance. Cantlie leaks the story to the press. The headlines are dynamite: Secret Agents Kidnapping a Man on British Soil! A Western Trained Doctor Marked for Death! An English Aristocrat Behind the Outrage! It becomes a sensation. Reporters surround the Legation. The Foreign Office Threatens China with diplomatic reprisals. And that afternoon, after 12 days of detention, Sun walks out the front door and into a horde of photographers. The Qing had tried to silence him. Instead, they'd made him an international celebrity. Sun had entered the Legation as a failed rebel, and emerged as the face of Chinese Revolution. And the press loved Sun. He was a great interviewee: intelligent, charming, and well-mannered. And he was good at crafting his message to target different audiences. Westerners, he knew, liked their revolutionaries moderate. He played up his Christianity and pushed for reforms, saving his more radical ideas for Chinese ears. For, as he conversed with European intelligentsia, and pored over books at London libraries, he started asking questions: Capitalism had built Britain, but how could such a rich society have so many poor people? American Government was an ideal, true, but it didn't live up to its tenants of racial equality. He dreamed of land reform, buying properties from tycoons at fair market value, and distributing it to China's landless peasants. He studied socialist thinkers, and interpreted Abraham Lincoln's words: ""of the people, by the people, and for the people"" as both a call for participatory government and a fairer economic system. And gradually, his gaze drifted back towards Asia. In London, he befriended a Japanese botanist who introduced him to a new movement: Pan-Asianism; an ideology that proposed Asian countries unify in the fight against Western imperialism. Tokyo, he said, had become a hotbed of Chinese revolutionaries, Philippine independence activists, and Japanese ultra-nationalist syndicates. And, it was awash with black market weapons. ""it sounded like a good place to build an alliance"", Sun thought. ""And, to plan another uprising."" "
420,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,cSKGa_7XJkg,"There's a quote usually attributed to the writer Mark Twain that goes, ""A lie can travel  halfway around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes."" Funny thing about that. There's reason to doubt that Mark Twain ever said this at all, thus, ironically, proving the point. And today, the quote, whoever said it, is truer than ever before. In previous decades,  most media with global reach consisted of several  major newspapers and networks which had the resources to gather information directly. Outlets like Reuters and the Associated Press that aggregate or rereport stories were relatively rare compared to today. The speed with which  information spreads now has created the ideal conditions for a phenomenon known as circular reporting. This is when publication A publishes misinformation, publication B reprints it, and publication A then cites B as the source for the information. It's also considered a form of circular reporting when multiple publications report on the same initial piece  of false information, which then appears to another author as having been verified by multiple sources. For instance, the 1998 publication of a single pseudoscientific paper arguing that routine vaccination of children causes autism inspired an entire  antivaccination movement, despite the fact that the original paper has repeatedly been discredited by the scientific community. Deliberately unvaccinated children are now contracting contagious diseases that had been virtually eradicated in the United States, with some infections proving fatal. In a slightly less dire example, satirical articles that are formatted to resemble real ones can also be picked up by outlets not in on the joke. For example, a joke article in the reputable British Medical Journal entitled ""Energy Expenditure in Adolescents Playing New Generation Computer Games,"" has been referenced in serious science publications over 400 times. User-generated content, such as wikis, are also a common contributer to circular reporting. As more writers come to rely on such pages for quick information, an unverified fact in a wiki page can make its way into a published article that may later be added as a citation for the very same wiki information, making it much harder to debunk. Recent advances  in communication technology have had immeasurable benefits in breaking down the barriers between information and people. But our desire for quick answers may overpower the desire to be certain of their validity. And when this bias can be multiplied by billions of people around the world, nearly instantaneously, more caution is in order. Avoiding sensationalist media, searching for criticisms  of suspicious information, and tracing the original source of a report can help slow down a lie, giving the truth more time  to put on its shoes.

421,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,cURn__xlWXk,"One foggy morning in 1884, the British steamer ""Rumney"" crashed into the French ship ""Frigorifique."" Seeing their ship filling with water, the French crew climbed  aboard the ""Rumney."" But as they sailed towards the nearest port, a silent form suddenly emerged from the fog: the abandoned ""Frigorifique."" It was too late to turn, and the impact was enough  to sink the ""Rumney."" As the sailors scrambled into the lifeboats, the empty ""Frigorifique"" sailed back into the fog, having seemingly taken its revenge. In reality, the French sailors had left the engines running, and the ""Frigorifique"" sailed in a circle before striking the ""Rumney"" and finally sinking. But its story became one of the many tales of ghost ships, unmanned vessels that apparently sail themselves. And although they've influenced works like ""Dracula"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" crewless ships aren't the product of ghostly spirits, just physics at work. One of the most famous ghost ships was the ""Mary Celeste"" found sailing the Atlantic in 1872 with no one aboard, water in its hold, and lifeboats missing. The discovery of its intact cargo and a captain's log that ended abruptly led to wild rumors and speculation. But the real culprits  were two scientific phenomena: buoyancy and fluid dynamics. Here's how buoyancy works. An object placed in a liquid displaces a certain volume of fluid. The liquid in turn exerts an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid that's been displaced. This phenomenon is called Archimedes's Principle. Objects that are less dense than water, such as balsa wood, icebergs, and inflatable rafts always float. That's because the upward buoyant force is always stronger than  the downward force of gravity. But for objects or ships to float when  they're made of materials, like steel, that are denser than water, they must displace a volume of water larger than their weight. Normally, the water filling a ship's hull would increase its weight and cause it to sink - just what the ""Mary Celeste's"" crew feared when they abandoned ship. But the sailors didn't account  for fluid dynamics. The water stopped flowing at the point of equilibrium, when it reached the same level as the hull. As it turned out, the weight of the water wasn't enough to sink the ship and the ""Mary Celeste"" was found a few days later while the unfortunate crew  never made it to shore. Far stranger is the tale of ""A. Ernest Mills,"" a schooner transporting salt, whose crew watched it sink to  the sea floor following a collision. Yet four days later, it was spotted floating on the surface. The key to the mystery lay in the ship's heavy cargo of salt. The added weight of the water in the hull made the vessel sink, but as the salt dissolved in the water, the weight decreased enough that the force of gravity  became less than the buoyant force and the ship floated back to the surface. But how do we explain the most enduring aspect of ghost ship legends: multiple sightings of the same ships hundreds of miles and several years apart? The answer lies in ocean currents, which are like invisible rivers flowing through the ocean. Factors, like temperature, salinity, wind, gravity, and the Coriolis effect from the Earth's rotation create a complex system of water movement. That applies both at the ocean's surface and deep below. Sailors have always known about currents, but their patterns weren't well known until recently. In fact, tracking abandoned ships was how scientists determined the shape and speed of the Atlantic Gyre, the Gulf Stream, and related currents in the first place. Beginning in 1883, the U.S. Hydrographic Office began collecting monthly data that included navigation hazards, like derelict ships, whose locations were reported by passing vessels. So abandoned ships may not be moved by ghost crews or supernatural curses, but they are a real and fascinating phenomenon born through the ocean and kept afloat by powerful, invisible, scientifically studied forces.

422,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,cXNTArhA0Jg,"In 1956, during a diplomatic  reception in Moscow, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev told Western Bloc ambassadors, ""My vas pokhoronim!"" His interpreter rendered that into English as, ""We will bury you!"" This statement sent shockwaves through the Western world, heightening the tension between the Soviet Union and the US who were in the thick of the Cold War. Some believe this incident alone set East/West relations back a decade. As it turns out, Khrushchev's remark was translated a bit too literally. Given the context, his words should have been rendered as, ""We will live to see you buried,"" meaning that Communism  would outlast Capitalism, a less threatening comment. Though the intended meaning was eventually clarified, the initial impact of Khrushchev's apparent words put the world on a path that could have led to nuclear armageddon. So now, given the complexities of language and cultural exchange, how does this sort of thing not happen all the time? Much of the answer lies with the skill and training of interpreters to overcome language barriers. For most of history, interpretation was mainly done consecutively, with speakers and interpreters making pauses to allow each other to speak. But after the advent of radio technology, a new simultaneous interpretations system was developed in the wake of World War II. In the simultaneous mode interpreters instantaneously  translate a speaker's words into a microphone while he speaks. Without pauses, those in the audience can choose the language in which they want to follow. On the surface, it all looks seamless, but behind the scenes, human interpreters work incessantly to ensure every idea gets across as intended. And that is no easy task. It takes about two years of training for already fluent bilingual professionals to expand their vocabulary  and master the skills necessary to become a conference interpreter. To get used to the unnatural task of speaking while they listen, students shadow speakers and repeat their every word  exactly as heard in the same language. In time, they begin to paraphrase  what is said, making stylistic adjustments as they go. At some point, a second language is introduced. Practicing in this way creates new neural pathways in the interpreter's brain, and the constant effort of reformulation gradually becomes second nature. Over time and through much hard work, the interpreter masters a vast array  of tricks to keep up with speed, deal with challenging terminology, and handle a multitude of foreign accents. They may resort to acronyms  to shorten long names, choose generic terms over specific, or refer to slides and other visual aides. They can even leave a term  in the original language, while they search for the most  accurate equivalent. Interpreters are also skilled at keeping aplomb in the face of chaos. Remember, they have no control over who is going to say what, or how articulate the speaker will sound. A curveball can be thrown at any time. Also, they often perform  to thousands of people and in very intimidating settings, like the UN General Assembly. To keep their emotions in check, they carefully prepare for an assignment, building glossaries in advance, reading voraciously  about the subject matter, and reviewing previous talks on the topic. Finally, interpreters work in pairs. While one colleague is busy translating incoming speeches in real time, the other gives support  by locating documents, looking up words, and tracking down pertinent information. Because simultaneous interpretation requires intense concentration, every 30 minutes, the pair switches roles. Success is heavily dependent  on skillful collaboration. Language is complex, and when abstract or nuanced concepts get lost in translation, the consequences may be catastrophic. As Margaret Atwood famously noted, ""War is what happens when language fails."" Conference interpreters of all people are aware of that and work diligently behind the scenes to make sure it never does. "
423,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,c_g1BMVFcuw,"We live in an age of protest. On campuses and public squares, on streets and social media, protesters around the world are challenging the status quo. Protest can thrust issues onto the national or global agenda, it can force out tyrants, it can activate people who have long been on the sidelines of civic life. While protest is often necessary, is it sufficient? Consider the Arab Spring. All across the Middle East, citizen protesters  were able to topple dictators. Afterwards, though, the vacuum was too often filled by the most militant and violent. Protest can generate  lasting positive change when it's followed by an equally  passionate effort to mobilize voters, to cast ballots, to understand government, and to make it more inclusive. So here are three core strategies for peacefully turning awareness into action and protest into durable political power. First, expand the frame of the possible, second, choose a defining fight, and third, find an early win. Let's start with expanding the frame of the possible. How often have you heard in response to a policy idea, ""That's just never going to happen""? When you hear someone say that, they're trying to define the boundaries of your civic imagination. The powerful citizen works to push those boundaries outward, to ask what if - what if it were possible? What if enough forms of power - people power, ideas, money, social norms - were aligned to make it happen? Simply asking that question and not taken as given all the givens of conventional politics is the first step in converting protest to power. But this requires concreteness about what it would look like to have, say, a radically smaller national government, or, by contrast, a big single-payer healthcare system, a way to hold corporations accountable for their misdeeds, or, instead, a way to free them from onerous regulations. This brings us to the second strategy, choosing a defining fight. All politics is about contrasts. Few of us think about civic life in the abstract. We think about things in relief compared to something else. Powerful citizens set the terms of that contrast. This doesn't mean being uncivil. It simply means thinking about a debate you want to have on your terms over an issue that captures the essence of the change you want. This is what the activists pushing for a $15 minimum wage in the U.S. have done. They don't pretend that $15 by itself can fix inequality, but with this ambitious  and contentious goal, which they achieved first in Seattle and then beyond, they have forced a bigger debate about economic justice and prosperity. They've expanded the frame  of the possible, strategy one, and created a sharp emblematic contrast, strategy two. The third key strategy, then, is to seek and achieve an early win. An early win, even if it's not  as ambitious as the ultimate goal, creates momentum, which changes  what people think is possible. The solidarity movement, which organized workers in Cold War Poland emerged just this way, first, with local shipyard strikes in 1980 that forced concessions, then, over the next decade, a nationwide effort that ultimately helped topple Poland's communist government. Getting early wins sets in motion a positive feedback loop, a contagion, a belief, a motivation. It requires pressuring policymakers, using the media to change narrative, making arguments in public, persuading skeptical neighbors one by one by one. None of this is as sexy as a protest, but this is the history of the U.S. Civil Rights Movement, of Indian Independence, of Czech self-determination. Not the single sudden triumph, but the long, slow slog. You don't have to be anyone special to be part of this grind, to expand the frame of the possible, to pick a defining fight, or to secure an early win. You just have to be a participant and to live like a citizen. The spirit of protest is powerful. So is showing up after the protest. You can be the co-creator  of what comes next. "
424,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,cba7di0eL8I,"John Snow’s report may not have done away with the miasma theory of disease - that would be left to Luis Pasture and Robert Koch - but it did surprisingly give contagionist and anticontagionists one thing they could agree on: filth was bad. Whether you believed that fetid stenches from the cesspits caused the Broad Street outbreak, or whether you believed that contamination from those cesspits seeping into the water table were at its root, this sort of unregulated disposal of waste into streets, basements and backyards was a problem. And so Snow’s report gave further credence to a growing movement, a movement that played a huge part in defining, and creating, the modern world. But it’s a movement rarely discussed, so today, we’re going to talk about The Sanitary Movement. Now, remember that everything we talked about with John Snow, everything we discussed with the Broad Street Outbreak, happened in 1854. That’s little more than 150 years ago, and yet to us today, it’s unimaginable that you would let sewage just flow freely through the streets or pump filth into your drinking water. So how did that change occur? How, in just a century and a half, did we get from sewage ridden cities to where we are today? Well, in my opinion, the impetus for the change was simple. This may sound mind blowing but, until the 19th century, cities were demographically negative. More people died than were born in cities; they were only kept afloat due to a constant influx of people migrating in. And it makes sense: squalid living conditions, tight packed populations and poor nutrition in a pre-refrigeration, pre-mass shipping world? These places were rife with disease. And, for most of mankind’s history, this wasn’t a huge concern, as the vast majority of the population needed to be working the land just to produce the food society needed. But the industrial revolution changed all that. Improved farming techniques meant that fewer people had to be working the land, and the growth of finished goods economies, massive manufacturing economies, meant that people were needed in the cities to work the factories, and that meant the cities had to grow. You just can’t have the complex, interconnected chains of production that define our world today unless you have great concentrations of population and massive urban centers. And this meant that we, as a species, had to rethink how we did cities. And the path to this began with a guy named Edwin Chadwick. In 1842, he released a report which basically said: “Look guys, there’s poop in the street. We gotta do something about the poop in the street.” And, surprisingly, this turned out to be a major catalyst for something actually being done about it. Now there’s a lot of debate over whether things started to get done because people actually cared about the plight of the poor, or if they were afraid of a popular uprising if conditions didn’t get a little better or if they actually just thought that more sanitary conditions meant fewer sick poor people which meant that this was a way to make the poor cost the government less money. But no matter what the cause, things started to get done. And in fact, the creation of local boards of health, like the very group that John Snow presented his findings to to get the pump handle in Broad Street removed, were a direct result of some of the legislation precipitated by Chadwick’s report. But in addition to forming local boards of health, this idea of creating sanitary cities went much further. They introduced sewers, real sewers, the kind we think of today. In fact many of our major sewer systems today are the systems they built during this time. Though John Snow wouldn’t live to see it, the London sewer system which his work helped to inspire, built in 1859, is still what our giant, modern city of London uses today. And you know what? That horrible specter, that demon cholera that John Snow spent his entire life fighting? The sewer system vanquished it. London would see only one more cholera epidemic after the Broad Street outbreak that John Snow so valiantly tried to contain, and this final outbreak happened in the one part of London where the sewer system hadn't yet been completed. Luckily this last epidemic was quickly attacked by a man named William Farr, the very same man who John Snow would so often pester at the Registrar General’s office for statistics. He had learned from Snow and believed his theory, and he used Snow’s methods to limit the outbreak of Cholera in 1866. After that epidemic, cholera in London would be no more. And this may sound like a simple thing, I mean we rarely ever think about the sewers flowing under our feet, but these sanitation projects were some of the greatest public works projects ever attempted. Monuments like the Eiffel Tower or Mount Rushmore pale in comparison to what needed to be done here. Imagine taking the city you live in and having to rip up every street, tunnel under every house, and connect every building with a massive network of pipes and waterways. Imagine the disruption this would cause. Imagine the expense. I’m honestly not sure we would be bold enough to take on such projects today. The London system alone had to run 13,000 miles of pipe to see this project completed. That’s roughly half the circumference of the earth. They laid 318 million bricks and dug out 2.7 million cubic meters of dirt from the streets of London just to put this sewer system in. In Europe, major parts of cities were sometimes simply torn down and rebuilt whole cloth around more sanitary lines In Chicago, they literally lifted the city up by four feet and put the sewer system underneath it. But in the end, these massive efforts had an effect. Not only was cholera defeated but things like typhoid and typhus were massively reduced, paving the way for the giant economic engines that we think of as today’s cities. It’s largely unsung, rarely given pages in history books or called out in classes, but the sanitary movement is one of the bedrocks of modern civilization, one of the stepping stones to the world we understand today. It’s had a profound effect on humanity and saved countless lives. It is up there with antibiotics and vaccines for the number of human deaths it’s prevented. So today, we just wanted to look at this one piece of John Snow’s legacy. He may only have been a tiny part of it, but it’s a part I think he’d be proud of, and although he’s better known as the father of epidemiology (and his contributions there were absolutely enormous), I think that he would want us to take a moment to look at and to remember a part of medical history that’s so important but so often glossed over because it’s unglamorous. So, unlike those who turned a blind eye to Snow’s own discoveries because they found them unpleasant to think about, let’s celebrate sanitation and all that it’s done for us. Here’s to you John Snow.

425,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,cpJlQo_65Ko,"In the ocean’s depths, two titans wage battle: the sperm whale and the colossal squid. Sperm whales use echolocation to hunt these squid for food, but even against this gigantic animal, squid can put up an impressive fight. Scientists know this because on the bodies of washed-up whales, they frequently find huge,  round suction scars, emblazoned there by large,  grasping tentacles. Ranging in size from this giant’s impressive 14 meters to the 2.5 centimeters of the southern pygmy squid, these creatures fall into the group of animals known as cephalopods. There are about 500 squid  species worldwide, and they live in all the world’s oceans, making them a reliable food source for whales, dolphins, sharks, seabirds, fish, and even other squid. Indeed, squid themselves  are fearsome ocean predators. But their most extraordinary adaptations are those that have evolved to help them thwart their predators. Squid, which can be found mainly in estuarine, deep-sea,  and open-water habitats, often swim together in shoals. Being out in the open without anywhere  to hide makes them vulnerable, so as a first line of defense, they rely on large, well-developed eyes. In the colossal squid,  these are the size of dinner plates, the largest known eyes  in the animal kingdom. When it’s dark or the water is murky,  however, squid rely on a secondary sensory system, made from thousands of tiny hair cells  that are only about twelve microns long and run along their heads and arms. Each of these hair cells is attached to axons in the nervous system. Swimming animals create a wake, so when the hairs on  the squid’s body detect this motion, they send a signal to the brain, which helps it determine the direction of the water’s flow. This way, a squid can sense an oncoming predator in even the dimmest waters. Aware of the threat, a squid can then mask itself from a predator. Squid skin contains thousands of tiny organs called chromatophores, each made of black, brown, red or yellow pigments and ringed in muscle. Reflecting cells beneath the chromatophores mirror the squid’s surroundings, enabling it to blend in. So, when the muscles contract, the color of the pigment is exposed, whereas when the muscles relax  the colors are hidden. Each of these chromatophores is under the individual control of the squid’s nervous system, so while some expand,  others remain contracted. That enables countershading, where the underside of the squid is lighter than the top, to eliminate a silhouette that a predator might spy from below. Some predators, however, like the whales and dolphins, get around this ruse by using sound waves to detect a squid’s camouflaged form. Not to be outfoxed, the squid still has two more tricks up its sleeve. The first involves ink, produced inside its mantle. Squid ink is made mostly of mucus and melanin, which produces its dark coloring. When squid eject the ink, they either use it to make  a large smokescreen that completely blocks the predator’s view or a blob that roughly mimics the size  and shape of the squid. This creates a phantom form,  called a pseudomorph, that tricks the predator into thinking it’s the real squid. As a final touch, squid rely on jet propulsion to rapidly shoot away from their hunters, reaching speeds of up to 25 miles per hour and moving meters away in mere seconds. This makes them Earth’s fastest invertebrates. Some squid species have also developed unique adaptive behaviors. The deep-sea vampire squid, when startled, uses its webbed arms to make  a cape it hides behind. The tiny bobtail, on the other hand,  tosses sand over its body as it burrows away from prying eyes. The Pacific flying squid uses jet propulsion for another purpose: to launch itself right out of the water. Squids’ inventive adaptations have allowed them to proliferate  for over 500 million years. Even now, we’re still uncovering new species. And as we do, we’re bound to discover even more about how these stealthy cephalopods have mastered survival  in the deep and unforgiving sea. "
426,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,cwwK7NmfF9w,"Billy Pilgrim can’t sleep because he knows aliens will arrive to abduct him in one hour. He knows the aliens are coming because he has become “unstuck” in time, causing him to experience events out of chronological order. Over the course of Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse-five, he hops back and forth between a childhood trip to the Grand Canyon, his life as a middle-aged optometrist, his captivity in an intergalactic zoo, the humiliations he endured as a war prisoner, and more. The title of Slaughterhouse-five and much of its source material came from Vonnegut’s own experiences in World War II. As a prisoner of war, he lived in a former slaughterhouse in Dresden, where he took refuge in an  underground meat locker while Allied forces bombed the city. When he and the other prisoners finally emerged, they found Dresden utterly demolished. After the war, Vonnegut tried to  make sense of human behavior by studying an unusual  aspect of anthropology: the shapes of stories, which he insisted were just as interesting as the shapes of pots or spearheads. To find the shape, he graphed the main  character’s fortune from the beginning to the end of a story. The zany curves he generated revealed common types of fairy tales and myths that echo through many cultures. But this shape can be the most interesting of all. In a story like this, it’s impossible to distinguish the  character’s good fortune from the bad. Vonnegut thought this kind of story  was the truest to real life, in which we are all the victims  of a series of accidents, unable to predict how events  will impact us long term. He found the tidy, satisfying arcs of  many stories at odds with this reality, and he set out to explore the ambiguity between good and bad fortune in his own work. When Vonnegut ditched clear-cut fortunes, he also abandoned straightforward chronology. Instead of proceeding tidily from beginning to end, in his stories “All moments, past, present and future always have existed, always will exist.” Tralfamadorians, the aliens who crop up in many of his books, see all moments at once. They “can see where each star has been and where it is going, so that the heavens are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti.” But although they can see all of time, they don’t try to change the course of events. While the Trafalmadorians may be at peace with their lack of agency, Vonnegut’s human characters are still getting used to it. In The Sirens of Titan, when they seek the meaning of life in the vastness of the universe, they find nothing but “empty heroics,  low comedy, and pointless death.” Then, from their vantage point within  a “chrono-synclastic infundibulum,” a man and his dog see devastating  futures for their earthly counterparts, but can’t change the course of events. Though there aren’t easy answers available, they eventually conclude that the purpose of life is “to love whoever is around to be loved.” In Cat’s Cradle, Vonnegut’s characters turn to a different source of meaning: Bokonism, a religion based on harmless lies  that all its adherents recognize as lies. Though they’re aware of Bokonism’s lies, they live their lives by these tenets anyway, and in so doing develop some genuine hope. They join together in groups called  Karasses, which consist of people we “find by accident but […]  stick with by choice”— cosmically linked around a shared purpose. These are not to be confused  with Granfalloons, groups of people who appoint significance to actually meaningless associations, like where you grew up, political  parties, and even entire nations. Though he held a bleak view of the human condition, Vonnegut believed strongly that “we are all here to help each other get through this thing, whatever it is."" We might get pooped and demoralized, but Vonnegut interspersed his grim assessments with more than a few morsels of hope. His fictional alter ego, Kilgore Trout,  supplied this parable: two yeast sat “discussing the possible purposes of life as they ate sugar and suffocated  in their own excrement. Because of their limited intelligence, they never came close to guessing that they were making champagne.” In spite of his insistence that we’re all here to fart around, in spite of his deep concerns about the course of human existence, Vonnegut also advanced the possibility, however slim, that we might end up  making something good. And if that isn’t nice, what is? "
427,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,dItUGF8GdTw,"Every day, a sea of decisions  stretches before us. Some are small and unimportant, but others have a larger impact  on our lives. For example, which politician should I vote for? Should I try the latest diet craze? Or will email make me a millionaire? We're bombarded with so many decisions that it's impossible to make a perfect choice every time. But there are many ways  to improve our chances, and one particularly effective technique is critical thinking. This is a way of approaching a question that allows us to carefully deconstruct a situation, reveal its hidden issues, such as bias and manipulation, and make the best decision. If the critical part sounds negative that's because in a way it is. Rather than choosing an answer  because it feels right, a person who uses critical thinking subjects all available options to scrutiny and skepticism. Using the tools at their disposal, they'll eliminate everything but the most useful and reliable information. There are many different ways of approaching critical thinking, but here's one five-step process that may help you solve any number of problems. One: formulate your question. In other words, know what you're looking for. This isn't always as straightforward as it sounds. For example, if you're deciding whether to try out the newest diet craze, your reasons for doing so may be obscured by other factors, like claims that you'll see results in just two weeks. But if you approach the situation with a clear view of what you're actually trying to accomplish by dieting, whether that's weight loss, better nutrition, or having more energy, that'll equip you to sift through this information critically, find what you're looking for, and decide whether the new fad really suits your needs. Two: gather your information. There's lots of it out there, so having a clear idea of your question will help you determine what's relevant. If you're trying to decide on a diet to improve your nutrition, you may ask an expert for their advice, or seek other people's testimonies. Information gathering helps you weigh different options, moving you closer to a decision that meets your goal. Three: apply the information, something you do  by asking critical questions. Facing a decision, ask yourself, ""What concepts are at work?"" ""What assumptions exist?"" ""Is my interpretation of the information logically sound?"" For example, in an email that promises you millions, you should consider, ""What is shaping my approach to this situation?"" ""Do I assume the sender  is telling the truth?"" ""Based on the evidence, is it logical  to assume I'll win any money?"" Four: consider the implications. Imagine it's election time, and you've selected a political candidate based on their promise to make it cheaper for drivers to fill up on gas. At first glance, that seems great. But what about the long-term environmental effects? If gasoline use is less  restricted by cost, this could also cause a huge surge in air pollution, an unintended consequence that's important to think about. Five: explore other points of view. Ask yourself why so many people are drawn to the policies of the opposing political candidate. Even if you disagree with everything that candidate says, exploring the full spectrum of viewpoints might explain why some policies that don't seem valid to you appeal to others. This will allow you  to explore alternatives, evaluate your own choices, and ultimately help you make more informed decisions. This five-step process is just one tool, and it certainly won't eradicate difficult decisions from our lives. But it can help us increase  the number of positive choices we make. Critical thinking can give us the tools to sift through a sea of information and find what we're looking for. And if enough of us use it, it has the power to make the world a more reasonable place. "
428,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,dO2xx-aeZ4w,"There's an organism  that changed the world. It caused both the first mass extinction in Earth's history and also paved the way for complex life. How? By sending the first free oxygen molecules into our atmosphere, and they did all this as single-celled life forms. They're cyanobacteria, and the story of these simple organisms that don't even have nuclei or any other organelles is a pivotal chapter  in the story of life on Earth. Earth's atmosphere wasn't always  the oxygen-rich mixture we breathe today. 3.5 billion years ago, the atmosphere was mostly nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. Almost all oxygen was locked up  in molecules like water, not floating around in the air. The oceans were populated by anaerobic microbes. Those are simple, unicellular life forms that thrive without oxygen and get energy by scavenging what molecules they find. But somewhere between 2.5 and 3.5 billion years ago, one of these microbial species, probably floating  on the surface of the ocean, evolved a new ability: photosynthesis. Structures in their cell membrane could harness the energy from sunlight to turn carbon dioxide and water into oxygen gas and sugars, which they could use for energy. Those organisms were the ancestors of what we now call cyanobacteria. Their bluish color comes from  the blue-green pigments that capture the sunlight they need. Photosynthesis gave those ancient bacteria a huge advantage over other species. They could now produce their own energy from an almost endless supply  of raw ingredients, so their populations exploded and they started polluting the atmosphere with a new waste product: oxygen. At first, the trickle of extra oxygen was soaked up by chemical reactions with iron or decomposing cells, but after a few hundred million years, the cyanobacteria were producing oxygen faster than it could be absorbed, and the gas started building up in the atmosphere. That was a big problem for the rest of Earth's inhabitants. Oxygen-rich air  was actually toxic to them. The result? About 2.5 billion years ago was a mass extinction of virtually all life on Earth, which barely spared the cyanobacteria. Geologists call this the Great Oxygenation Event, or even the Oxygen Catastrophe. That wasn't the only problem. Methane had been acting as a potent greenhouse gas that kept the Earth warm, but now, the extra oxygen reacted with methane to form carbon dioxide and water, which don't trap as much heat. The thinner atmospheric blanket caused Earth's first, and possibly longest, ice age, the Huronian Glaciation. The planet was basically  one giant snowball for several hundred million years. Eventually, life adjusted. Aerobic organisms,  which can use oxygen for energy, started sopping up some of the excess gas in the atmosphere. The oxygen concentration rose and fell until eventually it reached the approximate 21% we have today. And being able to use the chemical energy in oxygen gave organisms the boost they needed to diversify and evolve more complex forms. Cyanobacteria had a part to play in that story, too. Hundreds of millions of years ago, some other prehistoric microbe swallowed a cyanobacterium whole in a process called endosymbiosis. In doing so, that microbe acquired its own internal photosynthesis factory. This was the ancestor of plant cells. And cyanobacteria became chloroplasts, the organelles that carry out photosynthesis today. Cyanobacteria are still around in almost every environment on Earth: oceans, fresh water, soil, antarctic rocks, sloth fur. They still pump oxygen into the atmosphere, and they also pull nitrogen out to fertilize the plants they helped create. We wouldn't recognize life on Earth without them. But also thanks to them, we almost didn't have  life on Earth at all. "
429,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,dWjhxhMI-Qo,"The 30's dreamed white-marble  and slipstream chrome, immortal crystal and burnished bronze, but the rockets on the covers of the Gernsback Continuum pulps have fallen on London  in the dead of night, screaming. [Opening Theme] The Gernsback Continuum is William Gibson's first great story of alienation. Named after Hugo Gernsback, the fellow who the Hugo Awards  are named after and an individual who will certainly be  getting his own episode someday, The Gernsback Continuum is about a photographer who is hired to photograph the crumbling remains of that 30's art-deco ""World of the Future"" architecture that was once so common in America. You know, those UFO-like gas stations that you sometimes still find on empty stretches of highway, or those older movie theaters which are neon and extraneous flanges and spires rising towards space. But as he starts photographing these relics of a nearly forgotten past, he starts to see these great 12 engine planes and 20ty laned highways elements of an America  that never was. He sees people with flying cars  and food pills, Shining cities ten-thousand feet tall. He sees the future as we imagined it in the 30's, the future Hugo Gernsback  showed us in amazing stories. And visions of this unrealized future  are driving him mad or maybe he's already mad, not even he knows. And that's sort of the point. Not that he's going mad, but that  this future he is seeing is itself inherently mad. At least it is in the world  we live in today. There was this point in the 20's  and the 30's when that shining ray gun gothic future almost seemed possible, almost seemed like something that we as a species were just on the cusp of grasping. But in the 80's with holes  in the ozone layer, smog covering L.A., a Cold War going on, that ray gun future  seemed ludicrous, almost maddening in its absurdity. As Gipson puts it: ""The future had come  to America first but had finally past it by."" And yet, that is where so much of science fiction still lives stuck in that streamline  modern future The Gernsback Continuum has always struck me  as being about Gibson seeing the sci fi world of  of the late 70's and being driven mad wondering if he was the only one who saw  what he saw in the world around him, thy only one demanding that Science Fiction leave those maddeningly fantastical shining cities and come back home  to real America where things  weren't so clean or simple or pristine. And here is where we get back to that radical alienation that we talked about before Not only is the character  in Gibson's story isolated, alone, choosing to break off  from fashionable hip society, but they are also isolated and alienated from the strange world  that they are beginning to see, there's no place for them  to belong in the present, but there's place for them in this idealized sterile future either. Which brings us to one of William Gibson's  most interesting concepts, one that permutates  and defines a lot of his later work, the idea of Semiotic Ghosts. Let's just parse that phrase, semiotics in this case is the study of symbols specifically how symbols impart meaning  to our consciousness often semiotics is talked about  in the context of language. For example, when I say the word ""TREE"" if you share my language then you will picture a tree in your head. Now the word 'tree' really has absolutely nothing to do with the actual object itself, after all plenty of other languages have completely different words for 'tree,' and people who speak those languages have the same reaction to those completely different words. There's nothing about the word 'tree' that inherently makes it any better at describing trees than 'blurb,' 'fimble,' or literally any other sound that we can make up. And yet that word tree makes English speakers instantly think of an actual tree. How do we do that? How do we take a symbol  and make it mean more in our brain? But the science of semiotics goes beyond just spoken  or written language, semiotics incorporates anything  that serves as a symbol to us. And it is this that William is talking about  when he refers to Semiotic Ghosts. Semiotic ghosts are symbols that linger  in the collective subconscious they are ideas  that were diffused through our society  once upon a time and now for most people serve as some small piece of how we understand the world. This is a web of pop culture, urban legends, religious beliefs, myths, and stories. But in Gibson's view, sometimes, one of these symbols will come to the floor we'll be collectively haunted by one of these semiotic ghosts ; ) to the point that it's no longer just part of the background noise of how we understand the world but something that has  become real to us. The Gernsback Continuum raises this question: Why do so many alien abductees describe their captors as grey men with large heads? They all appear to to have seen the same thing because they are all drawing from that same cultural symbol for aliens that has been piped into our mass unconscious. And it's not that they are lying about what they think they saw, to them the thing they witnessed  was very real. In a very sense that shared cultural symbol is manifesting itself in our reality, And our protagonist in The Gernsback Continuum is encountering that same thing with the 1930's art-deco vision of the future. This idea that through the meaning making process we collectively make symbols real is essential for Gibson as he goes on  to immagine Cyber Space the idea that the virtual can be as real as reality is essential to his vision of the Internet. And though we don't have troads and we don't fly through Cyberspace on the giant virtual sharks he envisioned, alas, it turns out that Gibson was still right Our virtual lives, to many of us,  are as real as our real lives and the online space is as real, or at least certainly as present as the world we walk around in. On top of that, and just as important to Gibson's later work we are forming  new shared symbols constantly. Pop stars, celebrities, art--  be it songs, or novels, or something we haven't even invented yet, all of these things can serve as symbols for us they can create meaning. And any of them can slowly become a new semiotic ghost. The protagonist in this book happens to get swept up in the semiotic ghost of Hugo Gernsback at a time when most of the world had left those symbols behind. But we are forming and forgetting new semiotic ghosts all the time. And that idea is gonna play a huge part in Gibson's Bridge trilogy. But perhaps more than anything, these semiotic ghosts serve as an answer  for Gibson, these ghosts are something  we reach out to and cling to to create meaning in a world where meaning is increasingly obscured by scale and technology. These ghosts are almost  a defense mechanism. When we become so alienated so left behind  by the society we inhabit We turn instead to these symbols and lach on making  meaning from them. In many ways you could say our subcultures and our political identities today are grapes at meaning. That they are just some of our modern semiotic ghosts. At least that's the idea he's toying with in The Gernsback Continuum. But that's not the only exploration of modern alienation that Gibson will present us. He'll show us another take on isolation next time as we talk about The Belonging Kind. [End Theme] "
430,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,dkP8NUwB2io,"How do schools of fish swim in harmony? And how do the tiny cells in your brain give rise to the complex thoughts, memories, and consciousness that are you? Oddly enough, those questions have the same general answer: emergence, or the spontaneous creation of sophisticated behaviors and functions from large groups of simple elements. Like many animals, fish stick together in groups, but that's not just because they enjoy each other's company. It's a matter of survival. Schools of fish exhibit  complex swarming behaviors that help them evade hungry predators, while a lone fish is quickly singled out as easy prey. So which brilliant fish leader is the one in charge? Actually, no one is, and everyone is. So what does that mean? While the school of fish is elegantly twisting, turning, and dodging sharks in what looks  like deliberate coordination, each individual fish is actually just following two basic rules that have nothing to do with the shark: one, stay close, but not too close to your neighbor, and two, keep swimmming. As individuals, the fish are focused on the minutiae of these local interactions, but if enough fish join the group, something remarkable happens. The movement of individual fish is eclipsed by an entirely new entity: the school, which has its own unique set of behaviors. The school isn't controlled by any single fish. It simply emerges if you have enough fish following the right set of local rules. It's like an accident that happens over and over again, allowing fish all across the ocean to reliably avoid predation. And it's not just fish. Emergence is a basic property of many complex systems of interacting elements. For example, the specific way in which millions of grains of sand collide and tumble over each other almost always produces the same basic pattern of ripples. And when moisture freezes in the atmosphere, the specific binding properties of water molecules reliably produce radiating lattices that form into beautiful snowflakes. What makes emergence so complex is that you can't understand it by simply taking it apart, like the engine of a car. Taking things apart is a good first step to understanding a complex system. But if you reduce a school of fish to individuals, it loses the ability to evade predators, and there's nothing left to study. And if you reduce the brain to individual neurons, you're left with something that is notoriously unreliable, and nothing like how we think and behave, at least most of the time. Regardless, whatever you're thinking about right now isn't reliant on a single neuron lodged in the corner of your brain. Rather, the mind emerges from the collective activities of many, many neurons. There are billions of neurons  in the human brain, and trillions of connections between all those neurons. When you turn such a complicated system like that on, it could behave in all sorts of weird ways, but it doesn't. The neurons in our brain follow simple rules, just like the fish, so that as a group, their activity self-organizes into reliable patterns that let you do things  like recognize faces, successfully repeat the same task over and over again, and keep all those silly little habits that everyone likes about you. So, what are the simple rules when it comes to the brain? The basic function of each neuron in the brain is to either excite or inhibit other neurons. If you connect a few neurons together into a simple circuit, you can generate rhythmic patterns of activity, feedback loops that ramp up or shut down a signal, coincidence detectors, and disinhibition, where two inhibitory neurons can actually activate another neuron by removing inhibitory brakes. As more and more neurons are connected, increasingly complex patterns  of activity emerge from the network. Soon, so many neurons are interacting in so many different ways at once that the system becomes chaotic. The trajectory of the network's activity cannot be easily explained by the simple local circuits described earlier. And yet, from this chaos, patterns can emerge, and then emerge again and again in a reproducible manner. At some point, these emergent patterns of activity become sufficiently complex, and curious to begin studying their own biological origins, not to mention emergence. And what we found in emergent phenomena at vastly different scales is that same remarkable characteristic as the fish displayed: That emergence doesn't require someone or something to be in charge. If the right rules are in place, and some basic conditions are met, a complex system will fall into the same habits over and over again, turning chaos into order. That's true in the molecular pandemonium that lets your cells function, the tangled thicket of neurons that produces your thoughts and identity, your network of friends and family, all the way up to the structures and economies of our cities across the planet.

[Extra History Intro Theme] With Poland-Lithuania out of the fight Charles XII sets his eyes on another foe: The Russian giant, Peter the Great. While Charles had run roughshod over Poland Peter had taken advantage of the moment to once again assail the Baltic provinces. He was stopped short of his ultimate goal but Peter's efforts there were not without gain. His armies carved a path all the way to the Swedish fortress of Nyenskans which he tore down to build an even greater fortress The Peter &amp; Paul Fortress which would serve as the cornerstone for his most ambitious project of all: St. Petersburg. He would erect a new city here one grander and more modern than anything Russia had ever seen. This would be his gateway to the West his port that tied Russia into the economic life of Europe. It would be his new capital, on which he would spare no expense in treasure or lives. This was to be the culmination of his legacy the embodiment of all his ideas on westernizing Russia on becoming a naval power, on embracing European art and science and culture. But for that to be the case, Russia would have to succeed in holding onto these gains something that Charles XII could not abide. Throughout 1704 and 1705 Swedish forces tried to take Peter's great fortress but time and again, they were repelled. Soon, costs started to mount, and men who that ill afford to be lost died for little gain. So Charles revamped his strategy and blockaded St. Petersburg. While the blockade dragged on, he began marshalling his main force for a march to the east. It was at this point that Russia sent him a peace offer: in return for an armistice, Russia would give up all of their gains except for St. Petersburg and the forts connecting it to Russian territory. But Charles was having none of it. He knew how important St. Petersburg was. Why, with his invincible army, SHOULD he give it up? So Charles marched east, braving horrible weather and dangerous crossings to move with his traditional lightning speed. As he pressed forward, Peter fell back and back each defensive line Peter's commanders had planned to entrench was taken before their men could even unpack their spades. But even this march could not make up for the time Charles had lost trying to make Poland support his puppet king. In the years that had followed his initial victories over the Russians and the Polish-Lithuanian forces Russia had not only seized and fortified what would become St. Petersburg but reinforced it, and kept reinforcing it. Yet, the Swedish army was strong their king was able, their officers daring and intelligent. Top members of the military thought that it would be a tough fight but that they could take St. Petersburg. They drew up plans and submitted them to the king who swore them to utmost secrecy about the plans they had concocted. And so, the officers marched, thinking their objective to be St. Petersburg but soon, they found themselves near Minsk. Wait a minute, that wasn't on the way to St. Petersburg! Charles had marched them in a different direction and there was only one place they could be going from there. He was marching them to Moscow. Charles's officers had told him that they were not ready that striking so deep into Russia was simply too great of a gamble. It was something the army simply wasn't prepared for. BUT, how many times before had Charles been told that something was too great a gamble? How often had he heard that something was impossible only to then achieve it himself? He had made up his mind. They would not waste their time retaking lost territories. He would unseat Peter himself. The first two rivers they crossed with little opposition being slowed only by the fact that the retreating Russian forces burnt every bridge along the way. Tartar horsemen also harassed them continually, but this seemed a minor nuisance. They were making good time through bad country, but then, at the Vabich River they found a large enemy force barring their passage. The position held by the Russians was daunting: the Swedes would have to traverse marshy ground to get to them and beyond that was a forest, which might hide yet more troops. But Charles saw a way. The enemy line had a gap in it along a swampy area that the Russians clearly thought was impassable. Charles personally led his army across 1,500 yards of killing ground to reach this swampy area. At one point, his men were shoulder deep in water. The enemy line was split. The Russians tried to use numbers to heal the breach but heroic actions from the Swedish cavalry prevented any joining of Russian arms. Soon, the line began to collapse. The crossing was theirs.  Once again, the Swedes had triumphed against impossible odds. But keen observers in the army would have noted that though the Swedes emerged victorious these Russian troops were made of sterner stuff than they had been eight years back. Tactics and firm soldiering had been hammered into them since their retreat at Narva. They would not be turning and running like that anymore. This victory left Charles's army exhausted. It would take a month of rest before he could really move them again. And during this month, Peter was not idle. Peter stripped the land bare. He laid waste to any stretch of ground that the Swedes would have to cross and even though it was his own country and the suffering caused to his own people was immense Peter made no half-measure of it. Every grain of wheat was carted off every pasture where a horse might graze was turned to ash. There would be nothing but wasteland for the Swedes to traverse. Thus began a time of suffering for the Swedish forces. When they resumed their march, food was scarce. And with scarce food, came disease. This victorious army began to march as defeated men with hollow eyes and weary steps. Charles continued to rally them, but he had no real answer to this predicament. He had been counting on living off the countryside as they marched. Their supply lines were stretched beyond their limit. Many asked him to turn home, but he believed in Swedish arms. He believed that if he could just force Peter into one decisive battle they might yet win this war. But Peter demurred.  He would not give Charles the battle he wanted. And so, the Swedish marched across fields of ash seeing always in the distance villages alight candles in remembrance to Peter's uncompromising policy of starvation. In frustration, Charles turned to his officers and asked their advice. They recommended that the army fall back to the Dnierper, and meet up with a relief force laden with supplies. But this would be tantamount to giving up the campaign, so Charles asked for other options. Reluctantly, it was suggested that the Ukraine had not been as thoroughly plundered. It might be possible to gather supplies there and enlist the aid of friendly Cossacks. But such a move would cut the army off from any real ability to communicate with Swedish territory, or get resupplied from the empire. Still, Charles saw it as a possible path to victory where retreat offered none. His officers pleaded with him to at least wait for the relief force and their provisions, but Charles, fearing that further delays would only give Peter more time turned the army toward Ukraine immediately. They would now retrace their steps until they could turn south walking back across the same blasted waste from which they had just come. But as summer gave way to autumn, and autumn to winter a chill set in.  Then, a deep cold.  Then, a freezing, bone-gnawing frost And not just any frost.  This was what is known today as The Great Frost the coldest winter Europe has experienced in 500 years. Rivers froze from the Thames all the way down to the lagoons of Venice. And this frost served Peter well. By the time the winter of 1708 and 1709 came to an end Charles had only 20,000 remaining men able to fight less than half the number he'd begun this campaign with. HALF of his undefeated army, lost. But, there's still hope yet! Join us next time to find out what happens to his reinforcements to the Cossacks Charles hopes yet to enlist, and most of all, to the great army of Charles himself as he and Peter finally square off at the battle of Poltava.

He was aiming for the nearby Lake Maracaibo, home to a colony of Spanish settlers he planned to overthrow. But as Drake moved towards the mouth of the lake under cover of darkness, his plot was suddenly and magnificently foiled. Huge flashes of lightning  illuminated the landscape, exposing the fleet as if it were daytime, which warned the Spanish about his approach. Lake Maracaibo is  the stormiest place on the planet. The massive body of water at over 13,000 square kilometers is a place of almost perpetual storming. Thunderstorms rage above it for up to 200 days of the year, each earsplitting event lasting for several hours. Like everywhere else on Earth, lightning at Lake Maracaibo is the result of opposing electrical charges that steadily build up  inside storm clouds. Once there's a large enough difference between charges either within the cloud or between the clouds and the Earth below, it forms a spark that becomes a lightning bolt. Lightning strikes the earth about 350 million times per year, averaging out to eleven strikes a second. We know that thanks to satellites up in space and sensors on the ground. We can also measure the Earth's lightning density, which is the frequency with which lightning flashes in a square kilometer. Knowing where lightning strikes and how often reveals the most  lightning-rich places on Earth. In the polar regions, there may only be one strike per several square kilometers each year. Meanwhile, lightning density at the equator averages out to tens of flashes per square kilometer on account of the sun providing more heat to drive storms. Yet nowhere can quite compare with Lake Maracaibo, where lightning strikes an average 250 times per square kilometer, giving it the highest lightning density of any place on Earth. A number of factors converge to create the lake's seemingly everlasting storms. Firstly, Lake Maracaibo lies just  ten degrees north of the Equator, so there's a wealth of solar energy available to fuel the storms. Thunderstorms also require a supply of water vapor to feed on, and having the warm waters of the Caribbean so close by provides an endless supply. Finally, the lake's southern  and western edges are bordered by two massive  mountain ranges, and as cool winds surge down these slopes, they force up warm air, destabilizing the atmosphere and causing storm clouds to form. Together, these ingredients combine to give rise to the most awe-inspiring thunderstorms on the planet, a true sight to behold. Centuries ago, Sir Francis Drake may have cursed the lake's intense illumination, but today, sailors actually embrace this phenomenon. They call it the Maracaibo Beacon, and use it as a natural lighthouse to illuminate their path across the seas. "
433,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,dpCBMwAweDI,"This is the Bop. The Bop is a type of social dance. Dance is a language, and social dance is an expression that emerges from a community. A social dance isn't choreographed by any one person. It can't be traced to any one moment. Each dance has steps that everyone can agree on, but it's about the individual and their creative identity. Because of that, social dances bubble up, they change, and they spread like wildfire. They are as old as our remembered history. In African-American social dances, we see over 200 years of how African and African-American traditions influenced our history. The present always contains the past. And the past shapes who we are and who we will be. (Clapping) The Juba dance was born from enslaved Africans' experience on the plantation. Brought to the Americas, stripped of a common spoken language, this dance was a way for enslaved Africans to remember where they're from. It may have looked something like this. Slapping thighs, shuffling feet and patting hands: this was how they got around the slave owners' ban on drumming, improvising complex rhythms just like ancestors did with drums in Haiti or in the Yoruba communities of West Africa. It was about keeping cultural traditions alive and retaining a sense of inner freedom under captivity. It was the same subversive spirit that created this dance: the Cakewalk, a dance that parodied the mannerisms of Southern high society -- a way for the enslaved to throw shade at the masters. The crazy thing about this dance is that the Cakewalk was performed for the masters, who never suspected they were being made fun of. Now you might recognize this one. 1920s -- the Charleston. The Charleston was all about improvisation and musicality, making its way into Lindy Hop, swing dancing and even the Kid n Play, originally called the Funky Charleston. Started by a tight-knit Black community near Charleston, South Carolina, the Charleston permeated dance halls where young women suddenly had the freedom to kick their heels and move their legs. Now, social dance is about community and connection; if you knew the steps, it meant you belonged to a group. But what if it becomes a worldwide craze? Enter the Twist. It's no surprise that the Twist can be traced back to the 19th century, brought to America from the Congo during slavery. But in the late '50s, right before the Civil Rights Movement, the Twist is popularized by Chubby Checker and Dick Clark. Suddenly, everybody's doing the Twist: white teenagers, kids in Latin America, making its way into songs and movies. Through social dance, the boundaries between groups become blurred. The story continues in the 1980s and '90s. Along with the emergence of hip-hop, African-American social dance took on even more visibility, borrowing from its long past, shaping culture and being shaped by it. Today, these dances continue to evolve, grow and spread. Why do we dance? To move, to let loose, to express. Why do we dance together? To heal, to remember, to say: ""We speak a common language. We exist and we are free."" "

We're only beginning to understand why we sleep to begin with, but we do know it's essential. Adults need seven to eight hours of sleep a night, and adolescents need about ten. We grow sleepy due to signals from our body telling our brain we are tired, and signals from the environment telling us it's dark outside. The rise in sleep-inducing chemicals, like adenosine and melatonin, send us into a light doze  that grows deeper, making our breathing  and heart rate slow down and our muscles relax. This non-REM sleep is when DNA is repaired and our bodies replenish themselves for the day ahead. In the United States, it's estimated that 30% of adults and 66% of adolescents are regularly sleep-deprived. This isn't just a minor inconvenience. Staying awake can cause serious bodily harm. When we lose sleep, learning, memory, mood, and reaction time are affected. Sleeplessness may also cause inflammation, halluciations, high blood pressure, and it's even been linked to diabetes and obesity. In 2014, a devoted soccer fan died after staying awake for 48 hours  to watch the World Cup. While his untimely death  was due to a stroke, studies show that chronically sleeping fewer than six hours a night increases stroke risk  by four and half times compared to those getting a consistent seven to eight hours of shuteye. For a handful of people on the planet who carry a rare inherited genetic mutation, sleeplessness is a daily reality. This condition,  known as Fatal Familial Insomnia, places the body in a nightmarish  state of wakefulness, forbidding it from entering  the sanctuary of sleep. Within months or years, this progressively worsening condition leads to dementia and death. How can sleep deprivation cause such immense suffering? Scientists think the answer lies with the accumulation of waste prducts in the brain. During our waking hours, our cells are busy using up our day's energy sources, which get broken down  into various byproducts, including adenosine. As adenosine builds up, it increases the urge to sleep, also known as sleep pressure. In fact, caffeine works by blocking adenosine's receptor pathways. Other waste products  also build up in the brain, and if they're not cleared away, they collectively overload the brain and are thought to lead to the many negative symptoms of sleep deprivation. So, what's happening in our brain when we sleep to prevent this? Scientists found something called the glymphatic system, a clean-up mechanism that removes this buildup and is much more active when we're asleep. It works by using cerebrospinal fluid to flush away toxic byproducts that accumulate between cells. Lymphatic vessels, which serve as pathways for immune cells, have recently been discovered in the brain, and they may also play a role in clearing out the brain's daily waste products. While scientists continue exploring the restorative mechanisms behind sleep, we can be sure that slipping into slumber is a necessity if we want to maintain our health and our sanity. "
435,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,e7uXAlXdTe4,"Imagine, for a second, a duck teaching a French class, a ping-pong match in orbit  around a black hole, a dolphin balancing a pineapple. You probably haven't actually seen any of these things, but you could imagine them instantly. How does your brain produce an image of something you've never seen? That may not seem hard, but that's only because  we're so used to doing it. It turns out that this is actually a complex problem that requires sophisticated coordination inside your brain. That's because to create  these new, weird images, your brain takes familiar pieces  and assembles them in new ways, like a collage made  from fragments of photos. The brain has to juggle a sea of thousands of electrical signals getting them all to their destination at precisely the right time. When you look at an object, thousands of neurons  in your posterior cortex fire. These neurons encode various  characteristics of the object: spiky, fruit, brown, green, and yellow. This synchronous firing strengthens the connections between that set of neurons, linking them together into what's known as a neuronal ensemble, in this case the one for pineapple. In neuroscience, this is called the Hebbian principle, neurons that fire together wire together. If you try to imagine a pineapple later, the whole ensemble will light up, assembling a complete mental image. Dolphins are encoded by a different neuronal ensemble. In fact, every object that you've seen is encoded by a neuronal ensemble  associated with it, the neurons wired together by that synchronized firing. But this principle doesn't explain the infinite number of objects that we can conjure up in our imaginations without ever seeing them. The neuronal ensemble for a dolphin balancing a pineapple doesn't exist. So how come you can imagine it anyway? One hypothesis, called the Mental Synthesis Theory, says that, again, timing is key. If the neuronal ensembles  for the dolphin and pineapple are activated at the same time, we can perceive the two separate objects as a single image. But something in your brain  has to coordinate that firing. One plausible candidate  is the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in all complex cognitive functions. Prefrontal cortex neurons are connected to the posterior cortex by long, spindly cell extensions called neural fibers. The mental synthesis theory proposes that like a puppeteer pulling the strings, the prefrontal cortex neurons send electrical signals down these neural fibers to multiple ensembles in the posterior cortex. This activates them in unison. If the neuronal ensembles are turned on at the same time, you experience the composite image just as if you'd actually seen it. This conscious purposeful synchronization of different neuronal ensembles by the prefrontal cortex is called mental synthesis. In order for mental sythesis to work, signals would have to arrive at both neuronal ensembles at the same time. The problem is that some neurons are much farther away  from the prefrontal cortex than others. If the signals travel down both fibers at the same rate, they'd arrive out of sync. You can't change the length  of the connections, but your brain,  especially as it develops in childhood, does have a way to change  the conduction velocity. Neural fibers are wrapped in a fatty substance called myelin. Myelin is an insulator and speeds up the electrical signals zipping down the nerve fiber. Some neural fibers have as many as 100 layers of myelin. Others only have a few. And fibers with thicker layers of myelin can conduct signals 100 times faster or more than those with thinner ones. Some scientists now think that this difference in myelination could be the key to uniform conduction time in the brain, and consequently, to our mental synthesis ability. A lot of this myelination happens in childhood, so from an early age, our vibrant imaginations may have a lot to do with building up brains whose carefully myelinated connections can craft creative symphonies throughout our lives.

436,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,eEeeClBoqK0,"The talented young herbalist named Xu Xian was in trouble. It should have been a victorious moment– he had just opened his very own medicine shop. But he bought his supplies from  his former employer, and the resentful man  sold him rotten herbs. As Xu Xian wondered what to do with this  useless inventory, patients flooded into his shop. A plague had stricken the city, and he had nothing to treat them. Just as he was starting to panic, his wife, Bai Su Zhen, produced a recipe to use the rotten herbs as medicine. Her remedy cured all the plague-afflicted citizens immediately. Xu Xian’s former boss even had to buy back some of the rotten herbs to treat his own family. Shortly after, a monk named Fa Hai  approached Xu Xian, warning him that there was  a demon in his house. The demon, he said, was Bai Su Zhen. Xu Xian laughed. His kindhearted, resourceful wife  was not a demon. Fa Hai insisted. He told Xu Xian to serve his wife realgar wine on the 5th day of the 5th month, when demons’ powers are weakest. If she wasn’t a demon, he explained, it wouldn’t hurt her. Xu Xian dismissed the monk politely, with no intention of serving  Bai Su Zhen the wine. But as the day approached, he decided to try it. As soon as the wine touched  Bai Su Zhen’s lips, she ran to the bedroom,  claiming she wasn’t feeling well. Xu Xian prepared some medicine  and went to check on her. But instead of his wife, he found a giant white serpent with a bloody forked tongue in the bed. He collapsed, killed by the shock. When Bai Su Zhen opened her eyes, she realized immediately what must have happened. The truth was that Bai Su Zhen was  an immortal snake with formidable magical powers. She had used her powers to take a  human form and improve her and  her husband’s fortunes. Her magic couldn’t revive Xu Xian, but she had one more idea to save him: an herb that could grant longevity and even bring the dead back to life, guarded by the Old Man of the South Pole in the forbidden peaks of the  Kun Lun Mountains. She rode to the mountains on a cloud, then continued on foot passed gateways and arches until she reached one  marked “beyond mortals” hanging over a silver bridge. On the other side, two of the Old Man’s disciples guarded the herb. Bai Su Zhen disguised herself as a monk and told them she’d come to invite  the Old Man to a gathering of the gods. While they relayed her message, she plucked some leaves  from the herb and ran. The servants realized they had been  tricked and chased her. Bai Su Zhen coughed up a magic ball  and threw it at one. As the other closed in on her, she put the herb under her tongue for safekeeping, but its magic forced both of them  into their true forms. As the crane’s long beak  clamped around her, the Old Man appeared. Why, he asked, would she risk her life  to steal his herb when she was already immortal? Bai Su Zhen explained  her love for Xu Xian. Even if he didn’t want to be with her  now that he knew she was a demon, she was determined to  bring him back to life. The two had a karmic connection dating  back more than a thousand years. When Bai Su Zhen was a small snake, a beggar was about to kill her, but a kind passerby rescued her. Her rescuer was Xu Xian in a past life. Touched by her willingness  to risk her life for him, the Old Man permitted her to leave the  mountain with the immortal herb. Bai Su Zhen returned home  to revive Xu Xian. When he opened his eyes, the terrified look frozen on his face  became a smile. Demon or not, he was still happy to see his wife. "
437,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,eGL_M1SQV5E,"[intro music] We stand upon execution grounds in Constantinople. Seven men are lined up to die. One by one, they drop. The first man falls, rope snapped taut, feet tremble. The second man falls, then the third, the fourth, and the fifth. Then the final two drop. There's a defeaning crack, a retort that rings throughout the courtyard. Then, silence, and then frantic action. Two men are on the ground, gasping, grabbing their necks. The echoes of the sound, a sound not of bones breaking but of ropes snapping still bounds from the stone. The guards look about, confused. The executioner has yet to even become aware of his error. A group of monks, from the nearby monastery of Saint Conan, who have been watching from the crowd, surge forward to gather up the men. They can't let such suffering continue. The guards move to stop them, but the crowd bars their way. The monks procure a small boat, and row the men across the winter waters of the Bosphorus to the church of Saint Lawrence to ask sanctuary of the priests inside. Soon, the guards arrive, but the men are already safely within the church. They have sanctuary. The guard commander posts men at all the exits. They'll starve them out. It's not long before a crowd starts to gather. The men who were hanged, and the men who escaped, these were men of the Demes, men of the chariot racing factions that played such a huge part in Byzantine life. The Demes, the sports clubs that had a hand in everything from running the city fire departments to making major political decisions, had become more and more unruly, more and more lawless, over the preceding years. During a riot that had broken out after a chariot race a few weeks earlier, several people were murdered. A little hooliganry could be tolerated, but that was too much. Order had to be maintained in the capital. So seven of the ringleaders were marked to die for their crimes. But two of them didn't die, and they would serve as the tinder that would set Constantinople alight. On January 13, 532, the emperor Justinian entered his box in the Hippodrome. Like he would for any other race. But these races, the races to celebrate the ides of January, were to be different. The crowd began to shout for clemency, to beg the emperor to forgive the two men still holed up in the church. Race after race went by, and they continued to loudly implore the emperor. But the emperor was silent. He'd had too much of the Demes' controlling his city. Law would be restored. But as the last few races were being set up, the crowd's chant changed. They began to chant, Long Live the Merciful Blues and Greens because as fortune dictated, of the men hiding in the church, the ones who'd escaped, one was from each of the Demes. Then, suddenly, someone shouted, Nika! Then the crowd, perhaps tens of thousands strong, began to shout it at the emperor. Nika was the cry for victory. It meant conquer. And usually, the blues and greens would shout it at one another, taunting each other as their racers won, or encouraging their champions as they sped around the track. But here, now, with one voice, the entire stadium screamed it at the emperor. The Demes had always been kept in check by one another. They were never united, and so the emperor could play them against each other when the need was nearest, but here, they stood as one, chanting. This must have been a terrifying moment. The emperor's guard hastily led him out of his box, and down the specially constructed tunnel that connected his seat in the Hippodrome to the palace. The emperor was shaken, but he wasn't gonna be cowed by the mob. They'd likely fall back into their rivalries before nightfall. But the mob, now united, flooded out into the streets of Constantinople, burning and looting as they went. They made their way to the palace, and set the palace gate ablaze. But the fire spread. First, the church of Sancta Sophia, the great center of worship for the capital, caught alight. It was consumed by the flames. Then the baths, the great baths of Zeuxippus, the baths built by Constantine himself when he founded the city, adorned with treasures assembled from around the world, fell victim to the flame. The ash and tinder of antiquity floating off into the night sky. By dawn, much of the Augusteum, the palace quarter, was in cinders. But when the city woke, it wasn't the stunned and subdued city Justinian had hoped for. For five more days, the riot burned through the city. The palace was under siege. The prison was razed to the ground, and its prisoners loosed. And through all this, fire. Fire spread through every quarter, burnt its way through the wood and timber, leaping from house to house as the riot raged around it. And the riot itself was a servant of the fire, keeping those who would try to stay it, those who were part of the bucket brigades or part of the civic corps, fighting in the streets while the city burned. And then, on Sunday the 18th, as smoke covered Constantinople and nearly a quarter of the largest city in the world lay in smoldering ruin the crowd again gathered for the games. Justinian, cowed for perhaps the only time in his career, came out and told the crowd he would give their men pardon. But now that wasn't enough. The crowd shouted that they wanted evil officials removed. They shouted for removal of the city prefect, the man who had been responsible for the arrest of their leaders int he first place. This was to be expected. Justinian acquiesced. Then, the crowd called out the names of Tribonian, Justinian's legal advisor who had rewritten the law code, and John the Cappadocian, the empire's tax man. Justinian was stunned. These men were corrupt, but their corruption didn't particularly affect the poor citizens of Constantinople. This wasn't the sort of request the mob would make. No. This meant they were being backed by senators. By powerful men, perhaps some of the very same men who took shelter with him in the palace, who stood next to him while the mob howled outside. This spooked Justinian. He accepted these terms. He offered a full pardon to everyone involved. But even this wasn't enough. Clearly, the crowd had been primed. In their fury, they called for a new emperor. Justinian, again, retreated to his palace, and conferred with his advisors. He'd began to make plans to take the treasury, and those men loyal to him, and board ships to flee across the Bosphorus. Meanwhile, the mob raged through the city. The nephews to Anastasius, the previous emperor, still lived. Why were the people of Constantinople serving as slaves to this upstart emperor, born a peasant, when they had men of royal blood that they could elevate to the purple? As the riots had spread over the preceding days, most of Anastasius's remaining kin had fled the city. But one aging relative of the old emperor remained: a man named Hypatius. Hypatius never wanted to be emperor. In fact, he was hiding under his bed when the mob arrived. But they found him, and carried him on their shoulders back to the Hippodrome to crown him and proclaim him their emperor. But, as this was happening, Theodora, empress of Rome, looked at the trembling men around her counseling her husband to flee. and said, Whether or not a woman should give an example of courage to men is neither here nor there. At a moment of desperate danger, one must do what one can. I think that flight, even if it brings us to safety, is not in our interest. Every man born to see the light of day must die, but that one who has been emperor should become an exile I cannot bear. May I never be without the purple I wear, nor live to see the day when men do not call me Your Majesty. If you wish safety, my lord, that is an easy matter. We are rich, and there is the sea, and yonder are ships. But consider whether if you reach safety you may not desire to exchange to exchange that safety for death. As for me, I like the old saying, that the purple is the noblest shroud. There was a silence in the hall, and shame. Then, Justinian said, Get me Belisarius, Mundus, and Narses. While the palace guards had not been enough to quell the riots, as luck would have it, Belisarius, Justinian's greatest general, happened to be in the city waiting to be reassigned, and Mundus, the great Germanic general who had long defended the empire's northern frontier, was also passing through the city on his way to take up Belisarius's old post. Neither of them had their armies with them, but they did have their personal legions. At Justinian's command, they gathered their men. The last man Justinian gathered, Narses, was a deceptively frail man, a thin Armenian eunuch serving in the palace. Justinian trusted Narses. Narses was his master of the treasury, and as a eunuch Narses could never become emperor, so Justinian could ask Narses to do the very thing that had allowed his family to usurp the throne in the first place: take a big bag of money, slip out of the palace, and bribe those opposing him. Narses made his way to the Hippodrome, unnoticed, quietly following the stair that took him to the box where the leaders of the Blues stood as the crowd shouted and cheered for Hypatius. Narses reminded them that Justinian favored the Blues, and y'know that Hypatius guy's a Green, right? before putting a small stack of gold in each of their hands. Soon after members of the Blues started to silently disperse. But the Hippodrome was still filled with tens of thousands of Blues and Greens milling about the arena floor. Belisarius planned a commando raid to snatch Hypatius and flee, but he found the way blocked, so the order was given. Belisarius and his men entered from the east, while Mundus entered from the west. They marched in a line cutting down all before them. People panicked and fled, clambered over each other, were trampled as they ran, but impassive, the soldiers marched on. By the end of the day, 30 000 people lay dead in the Hippodrome. And Justinian's reign would never be challenged again. Join us next week as we watch Justinian rebuild Constantinople. And Belisarius sets out to recapture the west. [outro music] "
438,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,f9lEcwLnwfg,"Jump forward with us 125 years, from the Council of Nicea to the last days of the Western Roman Empire; Gaul, Hispania, much of North Africa have all been lost, Arian barbarians control nearly all of the Western Roman world. Britannia had long ago been abandoned The Huns have smashed into the Empire, sapping its remaining strength. But there was still the East, with its rich provinces of Anatolia and Egypt, to support the Empire. If the East would just step in, perhaps Rome could be put back together as it had under the reign of Aurelian. But the East was in the middle of a religious dispute. Now, that wasn't the only reason this didn't happen, of course. At this point, the East and the West had, in some ways, become closer to rivals than to coordinated parts of the Empire. And the Huns, although not causing as much damage as in the West, had extracted unimaginable tribute from the Eastern Empire. But, for all that, it certainly didn't make it any more likely that the East would step in when, in the middle of this crisis, the Emperor, Theodosius II, found himself mired in a religious schism. And here's where it gets really complex. All that esoteric and minor doctrinal stuff we talked about in the previous episodes, that's just a warm-up for what's coming now, so get ready. So there's this monk, Nestorius, and he's chummy with the Emperor. He gets tapped to be the Patriarch of Constantinople; just about the biggest deal you can be in the Christian world at the time, with Rome itself still barely part of the Empire. But he gets caught up in a local debate over the nature of Christ and starts espousing that Christ has two separate natures — one divine and one human. We'll call this ""Nestorianism."" This, of course, causes a huge flameout with the folks that we'll call, for reasons that will become obvious in a moment, ""the Chalcedonians,"" as they believed that Christ had two perfectly unified natures — one divine and one human, which, of course, caused a huge blowup with the guys that we'll call the ""the Monophysites,"" who believed that Christ was entirely of one nature — divine and human. I know what you're thinking: ""If anything, this all makes too much sense."" But, just in case a few of you got lost in how much sense that just made, I'll dive into a little more detail. That really is the basic split though: Does Christ have two separate natures, two unified natures, or one nature that sort of encompassed what everybody else called two natures? And that may seem really trivial, but, to people of the day, it was more than a simple matter of life and death. It was a matter of eternal life, or eternal damnation, so this is really, really important to a lot of people. But it also gets wrapped up with church politics, regional disputes, and imperial authority, because this guy,  Cyril of Alexandria, starts calling Nestorius' teachings ""heretical."" But the clergy in Constantinople are all basically like, ""Hey, who are you from faraway Alexandria to be telling us what to do?"" So Cyril actually reaches out to the pope in Rome and asks him for a judgement, who, in turn, basically says, ""Ugh, Cyril, go excommunicate this guy if he doesn't change his mind in, like, ten days."" So Nestorius turns to his buddy, Theodosius II, and says, ""Let's call a council and figure this out. ""And, by 'figure this out,' I mean 'Let's excommunicate Cyril'"" But, before the council even gets called, Cyril stands up and is basically like, ""You can't excommunicate me! I excommunicate YOU!"" And now it's on. The council is called,  and Cyril tries to ninja his way into being the guy running the council basically by saying, ""I'm the guy running this council."" At first, this doesn't work. But several of the delegations are delayed, and this gives Cyril time to prod some of the undecided bishops until he has a majority. And so, he just declares the council started and himself in charge. Nestorius is, of course, having none of this,  doesn't acknowledge Cyril, and refuses to accept that the council can begin before the delegation from Antioch arrives, which it hasn't yet. The bishops who back Nestorius all show up to the place where the council is being held to protest, and things start to get rowdy. At this point, the emperor's representative steps in and asks Cyril to just wait for four more days to see if the Antiochians arrive, which is when Cyril really steps up his ninja game and basically tricks the emperor's representative into reading the emperor's decree, which ends with an offhand line about how he wants them to, quote, ""Start the council without delay and bring unity back to the church quickly."" But an offhand line by the emperor is still an order by the emperor. And so, with that imperial decree read aloud to what was effectively a quorum, because the protesting bishops who supported Nestorius were there in the hall, legally, for both the church and the state, the council had now started. And, of course, that council promptly held up the excommunication of Nestorius. But, then, the delegation from Antioch finally arrives and, miffed that Cyril had started the thing without them, forms their own council and excommunicates Cyril. So Cyril's council excommunicates the Antiochians. And, now that everybody's excommunicated everybody else, everybody has to get word to the emperor, who's back in Constantinople, about who has been excommunicated. But the Nestorians have more friends at court, and they divert all of Cyril's messages until Cyril's faction sends a man dressed as a beggar with a message hidden in a hollowed-out cane, to secret his message through. So the emperor gets the news and banishes Nestorius, which, clearly, that resolves everything. Everyone would meekly give up, agree to get along, and all splits in the church would be healed forever. And yet, shockingly, everybody just kept excommunicating each other. The emperor called a second council to determine which of these excommunications were really legal. But this council was a mess, too, famously known as ""The Robbers Council,"" as it was convened with no time for any of the representatives from the West to get there, and so it was run almost entirely by Monophysites from the East. They proceed to excommunicate and condemn everybody even remotely connected with Nestorius. And, then, they went further and basically declared that the only correct way to see Christ was as having one nature. And, of course, this sets of everybody. The pope was livid, the bishops that were excluded were furious, and it goes without saying that those who got excommunicated or condemned without having any say in the matter were a little put-out as well. So the church starts to tear itself apart over this. And, in the midst of all of it, Theodosius II croaks. So the new emperor, Marcian, calls a third council to try to unravel this and figure out if any of it was legal at all. So, this time, the bishops all come together at a place called Chalcedon. All of the things the second council had said were, basically, immediately overturned, a bunch of the folks who had supported the second council were demoted or excommunicated, and the Chalcedonian Creed, or the idea that Christ was two perfectly-combined natures, was adapted as official canon of the church. Okay, so, surely now everything would be settled. Right? Wrong again! See, this is right about where the Coptic, Ethiopian, Eritrean, Syriac, and Armenian Apostolic and Malankara churches, split from what would now be called the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches — although, at the time, they were really one thing. Remember in the ""Justinian and Theodora"" episodes how Justinian kept trying to bring the church back together? This is the split he would later be trying to heal. And remember how Justinian was Orthodox and Theodora was Monophysite? Again, that's a big deal because this council, the Council of Chalcedon, split the whole Christian world down those lines. And this division would rip the Byzantine world apart for centuries. It would take on political dimensions as well as religious ones, as one easy way to oppose the emperor was always to stir up whatever religious faction he wasn't a part of. This split would also make it easier for other groups to break the more Monophysite-leaning regions off from the empire as it started to decline. Who knows how history would have turned out without these schisms, heresies, and disputes? Would it have saved Rome, or would it have just left Europe even more fragmented without those hard-fought ideas to bind it together? What we do know is that is that all this though and all this effort helped to shape the Late Classical and Early Medieval period. For better or worse, these esoteric disputes played a huge part in the transition from the Ancient world to the Medieval one. So, thank you for bearing with us as we wound our way through all that esoterica. These names — Arianism, Monophysites, Chalcedonians — they're going to come up again and again as we discuss this period of history. And there's no way we could give a complete picture of this era without them. Thanks for watching, and we'll see you next time. "
439,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,fFeV8WxIZLk,"About once every century, a massive star somewhere in our galaxy runs out of fuel. This happens after millions of years  of heat and pressure have fused the star’s hydrogen into heavier elements like helium, carbon, and nitrogen— all the way to iron. No longer able to produce sufficient energy to maintain its structure, it collapses under its own gravitational pressure and explodes in a supernova. The star shoots most of its innards into space, seeding the galaxy with heavy elements. But what this cataclysmic eruption leaves behind might be even more remarkable: a ball of matter so dense that  atomic electrons collapse from their quantum orbits  into the depths of atomic nuclei. The death of that star  is the birth of a neutron star: one of the densest known objects  in the universe, and a laboratory for the strange physics  of supercondensed matter. But what is a neutron star? Think of a compact ball inside of which protons and electrons fuse into neutrons and form a frictionless liquid called a superfluid— surrounded by a crust. This material is incredibly dense – the equivalent of the mass of a  fully-loaded container ship squeezed into a human hair, or the mass of Mount Everest in a space of a sugar cube. Deeper in the crust, the neutron superfluid forms different phases that physicists call “nuclear pasta,” as it’s squeezed from lasagna  to spaghetti-like shapes. The massive precursors to  neutron stars often spin. When they collapse, stars that are typically millions of  kilometers wide compress down to neutron stars that are only about 25 kilometers across. But the original star’s angular  momentum is preserved. So for the same reason that a figure  skater’s spin accelerates when they bring in their arms, the neutron star spins much more rapidly than its parent. The fastest neutron star on record rotates over 700 times every second, which means that a point on its surface whirls through space at more than a fifth  of the speed of light. Neutron stars also have the strongest  magnetic field of any known object. This magnetic concentration forms vortexes that radiate beams from the magnetic poles. Since the poles aren’t always aligned with the rotational axis of the star, the beams spin like lighthouse beacons, which appear to blink  when viewed from Earth. We call those pulsars. The detection of one of these  tantalizing flashing signals by astrophysicist Jocelyn Bell in 1967 was in fact the way we indirectly discovered neutron stars in the first place. An aging neutron star’s furious rotation slows over a period of billions of years as it radiates away its energy in the form of electromagnetic and gravity waves. But not all neutron stars  disappear so quietly. For example, we’ve observed binary systems where a neutron star co-orbits another star. A neutron star can feed on  a lighter companion, gorging on its more  loosely bound atmosphere before eventually collapsing cataclysmically into a black hole. While many stars exist as binary systems, only a small percentage of those end up  as neutron-star binaries, where two neutron stars circle each other  in a waltz doomed to end as a merger. When they finally collide, they send  gravity waves through space-time like ripples from a stone  thrown into a calm lake. Einstein’s theory of General Relativity predicted this phenomenon over 100 years ago, but it wasn't directly verified until 2017, when gravitational-wave observatories  LIGO and VIRGO observed a neutron star collision. Other telescopes picked up a burst of gamma rays and a flash of light, and, later, x-rays and radio signals, all from the same impact. That became the most studied event in the history of astronomy. It yielded a treasure trove of data that’s helped pin down the speed  of gravity, bolster important theories in astrophysics, and provide evidence for the origin of heavy elements like gold and platinum. Neutron stars haven’t given up all their secrets yet. LIGO and VIRGO are being upgraded to detect more collisions.

So familiar, in fact, that for centuries we’ve had a single word to describe such characters: Machiavellian. But is it possible that we’ve been using that word wrong this whole time? The early 16th century statesman Niccoló Machiavelli wrote many works of history, philosophy,  and drama. But his lasting notoriety comes from a brief political essay known as The Prince, framed as advice to current and future monarchs. Machiavelli wasn’t the first to do this– in fact there was an entire tradition of  works known as “mirrors for princes” going back to antiquity. But unlike his predecessors, Machiavelli didn’t try to describe an  ideal government or exhort his audience to rule  justly and virtuously. Instead, he focused on the  question of power– how to acquire it, and how to keep it. And in the decades after it was published, The Prince gained a diabolical reputation. During the European Wars of Religion, both Catholics and Protestants  blamed Machiavelli for inspiring acts of violence and tyranny committed by their opponents. By the end of the century, Shakespeare was using “Machiavel” to denote an amoral opportunist, leading directly to our popular use of “Machiavellian” as a synonym for manipulative villainy. At first glance, The Prince’s reputation as a manual for  tyranny seems well-deserved. Throughout, Machiavelli appears entirely  unconcerned with morality, except insofar as it’s helpful or harmful  to maintaining power. For instance, princes are told to  consider all the atrocities necessary to seize power, and to commit them in a single stroke to ensure future stability. Attacking neighboring territories and oppressing religious minorities are mentioned as effective ways of occupying the public. Regarding a prince’s personal behavior, Machiavelli advises keeping up the  appearance of virtues such as honesty or generosity, but being ready to abandon them as soon as one’s interests are threatened. Most famously, he notes that for a ruler, “it is much safer to be feared  than loved.” The tract even ends with an appeal to  Lorenzo de’ Medici, the recently installed ruler of Florence, urging him to unite the fragmented city-states of Italy under his rule. Many have justified Machiavelli as motivated by unsentimental realism and a desire for peace in an Italy torn by internal and external conflict. According to this view, Machiavelli was the first to understand  a difficult truth: the greater good of political stability is worth whatever unsavory tactics are needed to attain it. The philosopher Isaiah Berlin suggested that rather than being amoral, The Prince hearkens back to ancient Greek morality, placing the glory of the state above the Christian ideal of individual salvation. But what we know about Machiavelli might not fit this picture. The author had served in his native  Florence for 14 years as a diplomat, staunchly defending its elected  republican government against would-be monarchs. When the Medici family seized power, he not only lost his position, but was even tortured and banished. With this in mind, it’s possible to read the pamphlet  he wrote from exile not as a defense of princely rule, but a scathing description of how it operates. Indeed, Enlightenment figures like Spinoza saw it as warning free citizens of the various ways in which they can be subjugated by aspiring rulers. In fact, both readings might be true. Machiavelli may have written a manual for  tyrannical rulers, but by sharing it, he also revealed  the cards to those who would be ruled. In doing so, he revolutionized political philosophy, laying the foundations for Hobbes and  future thinkers to study human affairs based on their  concrete realities rather than preconceived ideals. Through his brutal and shocking honesty, Machiavelli sought to shatter popular delusions about what power really entails. And as he wrote to a friend shortly before his death, he hoped that people would “learn the way to Hell in order to flee from it."" "
441,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,fygjGXnaV9w,"In March of 1892, three Black grocery store owners  in Memphis, Tennessee, were murdered by a mob of white men. Lynchings like these were happening all over the American South, often without any subsequent legal  investigation or consequences for the murderers. But this time, a young journalist and friend of the victims set out to expose the truth  about these killings. Her reports would shock the nation and launch her career as an investigative journalist, civic leader, and civil rights advocate. Her name was Ida B. Wells. Ida Bell Wells was born into slavery in Holly Springs, Mississippi on July 16, 1862, several months before the Emancipation Proclamation released her and her family. After losing both parents and a brother  to yellow fever at the age of 16, she supported her five remaining siblings by working as a schoolteacher in Memphis, Tennessee. During this time, she began working as a journalist. Writing under the pen name “Iola,” by the early 1890s she gained  a reputation as a clear voice against racial injustice and become co-owner and editor of the Memphis Free Speech  and Headlight newspaper. She had no shortage of material: in the decades following the Civil War, Southern whites attempted to reassert  their power by committing crimes against Black people including suppressing their votes, vandalizing their businesses,  and even murdering them. After the murder of her friends, Wells launched an investigation  into lynching. She analyzed specific cases through  newspaper reports and police records, and interviewed people who had lost  friends and family to lynch mobs. She risked her life  to get this information. As a Black person investigating racially  motivated murders, she enraged many of the same southern  white men involved in lynchings. Her bravery paid off. Most whites had claimed and  subsequently reported that lynchings were responses to criminal acts by Black people. But that was not usually the case. Through her research, Wells showed that these murders  were actually a deliberate, brutal tactic to control or punish  black people who competed with whites. Her friends, for example, had been lynched when their grocery store became popular enough to divert business  from a white competitor. Wells published her findings in 1892. In response, a white mob destroyed her newspaper presses. She was out of town when they struck, but they threatened to kill her  if she ever returned to Memphis. So she traveled to New York, where that same year she re-published her research in a pamphlet titled Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases. In 1895, after settling in Chicago, she built on Southern Horrors in a longer  piece called The Red Record. Her careful documentation of the horrors  of lynching and impassioned public speeches  drew international attention. Wells used her newfound fame  to amplify her message. She traveled to Europe, where she rallied European outrage against racial violence in the American South in hopes that the US government and public would follow their example. Back in the US, she didn’t hesitate to confront powerful  organizations, fighting the segregationist  policies of the YMCA and leading a delegation to the White House to protest discriminatory  workplace practices. She did all this while  disenfranchised herself. Women didn’t win the right to vote  until Wells was in her late 50s. And even then, the vote was primarily  extended to white women only. Wells was a key player in the battle  for voting inclusion, starting a Black women’s  suffrage organization in Chicago. But in spite of her deep commitment  to women’s rights, she clashed with white leaders  of the movement. During a march for women’s suffrage in Washington D.C., she ignored the organizers’ attempt to placate Southern bigotry by placing Black women in the back, and marched up front alongside the white women. She also chafed with other civil rights leaders, who saw her as a dangerous radical. She insisted on airing, in full detail, the atrocities taking place in the South, while others thought doing so would be  counterproductive to negotiations with white politicians. Although she participated in the founding  of the NAACP, she was soon sidelined from the organization. Wells’ unwillingness to compromise any aspect of her vision of justice shined a light on the weak points of the various rights movements, and ultimately made them stronger— but also made it difficult for her  to find a place within them. She was ahead of her time, waging a tireless struggle  for equality and justice decades before many had even begun  to imagine it possible. "
442,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,fyyes_IMNoo,"Welcome extra historians to Lies The episode where we fess up to our mistakes and flesh out the things we skipped over Today, we're doing the 1918 flu pandemic. It's a big global story We've got a lot of ground to cover. You had a lot of questions and a lot of corrections So we're just gonna lightning round it. We're gonna go real fast So first of all, we're going to talk about our recommended reads. There's two this series One is The Great Influenza by John M. Barry This is a great book if you want to know anything about the American response effort, Welch, Park and Williams, Avery, all that good stuff Next, Pale Rider by Laura Spinney, great book, has like the global context of the flu It's sometimes been criticized by... ...for going a little too far in some of its conclusions, but I think it's overall pretty solid Especially if you take it with a little bit of a grain of salt But it's probably the best... ...just, global palette of what's going on you could possibly find, so I highly recommend it Let's get to, like, the big embarrassing upside-down elephant in the room This is the flag of Germany This is the flag of Yemen, so... It would take too long to explain exactly how a mistake this big happened, but... Essentially, I send off photo references when I finish an episode. The artist sends me back a prop sheet The flag was upset on the prop sheet I took the prop sheet and I took the reference for the flag of the German Empire and went... ""Yeah, that's the same"" because the pattern recognition part of my brain is kinda broken, so... ...and unfortunately we... We had already uploaded three episodes worth of it by the time we released the first one... ...and people mention that it was upside down and you know, I kind of-- There was something about it that bothered me, but then I looked at the prop sheet and it was right on the prop sheet And the prop sheet must be right, right? So yeah, sorry, that's totally my fault Some of you were a little concerned that we focused too much on the United States I actually agree with you. My original conception of this series was... ...going to be a lot more like, jumping between medical teams in different countries But after kind of conferencing with the artist, I realized that that was asking way too much of them It's a lot to change... ...change what country we're portraying because it's different national costumes, modes of transportation... ...architecture, and they have to pull-- Like, I have to get a big photo library together for every new country ...And basically have them create unique art assets for it So the best we can do, basically, was just one episode that was just like boom-boom-boom-boom... ...just hitting, kind of, notable places in the world, and that was not ideal It's not what I had envisioned originally, but it was the best we could do. I'm sorry about that Mispronunciations: we had a few We were very very busy, had a difficult time re-recording stuff because we were recording so much during this period The Koch Institute has the ""CH"" instead of the ""Koke Institute"" We said, ""Arizonian"", it's Arizonan We said, ""John Hopkins"" when it should be Johns Hopkins I can't remember exactly what pronunciation we used for Manchu, but it was wrong and... Pogo Pogo is the capital of American Samoa, not ""Pago Pago"" A lot of these stuff are things that we flagged. We just didn't have time to fix, unfortunately So let's move on to Episode one A lot you pointed out that we used the caduceus, the rod of Hermes, as a symbol for American medicine And really, it should be the rod of Asclepius We did use that for the American Medical Association because the rod of Asclepius is the symbol for the American Medical Association But the symbol for the US Army Surgeon General... ...is the rod of caduceus, because they were confused when they picked it in the 1900s Excuse me, 1800s So yeah, that's a mistake, but it's a historical mistake Some of you mentioned that there's no selection pressure toward deadliness in a virus That is true... ...but, as long as a virus, basically, can still spread, it doesn't necessarily matter how deadly it is You know, it's all just sort of a genetic roll of the dice And the Spanish Flu progressively got more deadly while still spreading very well, but you were absolutely right There is no selection pressure pushing a virus to be more deadly We also... ...had a lot-- very indirect line about the randomness of natural selection We should have said the randomness of mutation. Natural selection is not random Someone pointed out that heliotrope cyanosis, when people turn blue... Right? When they had a cytokine storm inside the ""lungal area""... *Very scientific* It didn't look like the patches that we showed, and that's true The thing is, tinting is a very difficult thing to do in our animation styles... ...so we just kind of used as a cheat In general, you'd get kind of like a purplish tinge to your cheeks and ears and it would spread and eventually turn you blue And that's how it would really look. It would just be sort of a deepening... ...rather than those patches that we showed in the animation Some of you mentioned that La Grippe is not a nickname for the flu It's just French for ""the flu"" True, but English and American troops started calling it that, too There was this really interesting linguistic exchange going on in the trenches A lot of you mentioned that our... ...section on Ludendorff and the Spring Offensive was an oversimplification 100% true. Rather than explaining all of that because we have so little time... ...I'd actually suggest you just go over to The Great War... ...and watch every episode, because the Spring Offensive is just about over, over there And they do a great job, and all of their German flags are right-side up, all the time. I don't know how they do it We're going to episode three, now Welch actually didn't die. He lived until 1934. That's my fault. I wrote it that way to increase... ...increase the tension and... I accidentally misinformed people that the Welch had died. He had not But he was knocked out, basically, for the rest of the crisis A lot of people wondered why... ...Officials, particularly in Philadelphia, didn't treat flu seriously Part of it was just focused on the war, part of it was just thinking that flu was a... ...seasonal thing that would go away But in Philadelphia, you have a very special case So, the mayor is a little distracted during this time because he has just been indicted in the death of a Philadelphia policeman You can go read about it. His name is Thomas S. Smith and he was working for the Ver(?) political machine... ...in Philadelphia, but the long and short of it is, basically... He and a bunch of his cronies during a Republican primary hired a gang from New York to come down and beat up their primary opponent... ...and... ...a Philadelphia policeman stepped in to try and defend the guy and ended up getting shot and killed So he was indicted for... The actual charges were... ...conspiracy to commit murder and impeding an election We had Anna Williams kind of look like she was the same age as William Parke Actually, they were exactly the same age: 55 That's, again, like the shading thing, right? It's difficult to do someone with kind of like salt and pepper hair in our animation style And I like the contrast of the kind of younger-in-spirit Williams with the older-in-spirit Park Some wondered, ""Is this Gorgas the same... ...guy who battled yellow fever during the Panama-- building of the Panama Canal?"" Yes, he is I don't think-- He was not Surgeon General at that time, but... Yeah, that's Gorgas. It's-- And that's the thing he's most famous for to this day In episode four... Someone mentioned that we seem to be confusing.. ...vaccine with antitoxin with serum, that vaccine is preventative... ...that it shouldn't include antibodies Conceptions of what a vaccine is have kind of changed a little bit But broadly, that's right, like, but we were sort of using it as a shorthand for all three of those things They were making all three And by the way, the Rockefeller Institute... ...wasn't just, like hoarding vaccines and keeping them away from the public They used all their vaccines on the army and civilian workers who were supporting a war effort So it wasn't like a stingy thing of like, ""No! Here, get away from our vaccines"" They, yeah, they were all gone and some had to be made for the civilian population There was a question, ""Was there international cooperation?"" Largely not But, these doctors were reading medical articles that came out in different countries And there was one interesting thing where early, upon entering the war, the Rockefeller Institute... ...found a very effective treatment for gangrene... ...and they started wondering, like, ""Hey, should we publish this in a-- in a International Journal because then it'll help the Germans?"" And they ultimately decided, ""Our duty as doctors is above our duty as soldiers"" So, they published it and indeed it was used in the German army A lot of people asked if dogs had eaten the Yupik family alive Possibly, because there's a thing that happened all the way across the continent on the island of Labrador, where... ...the village just stopped feeding the dogs because everyone got too sick to get out of bed And the dogs started literally jumping through windows and pawing in doors and attacking people in their beds And we know this because a guy came looking for his friend he hadn't heard from in a while, and he found the guy... ...sitting up in bed with a rifle across his lap, a box of bullets... ...surrounded by dead dogs So yeah, go to sleep with that This is a big one: Why didn't we mention Germany and China? So... When I realized that we hadn't put numbers for Germany in the fifth or sixth episode... ...I tried to go in and add them to the sixth week. We didn't have time The number I came up with was 426,000, for what it's worth But the thing with the German numbers is they're a little spongy, because what you do... ...is you get a baseline for what the death rate would be in a place at that time, and then you figure out the excess mortality Right? Very difficult to get a baseline on Germany on 1918--1919 There's a lot of people moving around, a lot of people going in and out of the army I suspect it's higher than that, 426,000 German officers tended to cover up the fact their soldiers had died of Spanish Flu... Not because they didn't want people knowing But because they just didn't want their families to know that they hadn't died in combat, that they died in a hospital You know, wasting away from a terrible disease Same thing happened in the US Army, by the way With China... We specifically avoided it because China is very contentious There are people who think that... ...it had a really really high death rate and that's based on reports from Western missionaries that were going up in the mountain villages But it could just be that those more isolated communities got hit hard And there are people that think it really wasn't hit that hard at all, because there doesn't seem to be the same kind of thing in China You don't have, like, mass graves in Shanghai and Beijing I looked here in Hong Kong, and I didn't really find anything And that might suggest that it emerged from China and most people were immune from the mild first wave We cut out like a bunch of other possible origins There's one from a military hospital in France Some people think that migrating Canadian geese spread it Basically, name... Name a country and there's a theory about it We could take this whole episode and just talking about emergence theories But we-- we picked two that we thought were pretty likely If you're curious about that sample of Spanish Flu... It's in a CDC lab in a very secure area and they've sequence its genome now And we don't really know, though, at what point... ...what point that sample comes from. So, is it from the more mild wave is it from the deadly second wave? Had it been mutated and become less virulent? We don't know So it's a little bit difficult to know if-- how good a sample that is but they're working on it One thing I wanted to point out, that we didn't get to in episode six, is that the way that... ...the horrors of World War I... ...sort of killed the optimism about technology and human progress... A similar thing happened in medicine with Spanish Flu So, there, like, major doctors before the the outbreak were talking about, like, in 50 years communicable disease may disappear We may have a disease-free future And Victor Vaughn, who we briefly had in the episode (he was the guy charting the disease on the map) has a great quote about this ""The saddest part of my life was when I witnessed the hundreds of deaths of the soldiers in the army camps... ...and did not know what to do ""At that moment, I decided never again to prate about the great achievements of medical science... ...and to humbly admit our dense ignorance in this case ""I saw hundreds of young stalwart men in uniform coming to the wards of the hospital ""Every bed was full, yet others crowded in. The faces were a bluish cast; a cough brought up the blood-stained sputum"" Let's go through some famous victims of Spanish Flu that we didn't have in the episodes The first one we did mention was President Wilson, but I wanted to add a little color to that So, Wilson drops in the middle of the negotiations in Paris for what will become the Treaty of Versailles And he is bedridden with what we now suspect was Spanish Flu And it probably brought on the stroke that later killed him What's a big issue with that is the fact that he was one of the main people that wanted an equitable treaty... ...with Germany, because he believed peace in Europe was not possible if they forced a punishing treaty on the Central Powers So how might history have been different? Because once he dropped... ...it was done. Like, he lost all his strength. He abandoned all of his positions. He just got walked over. Went home So, in addition to him, we have the president-elect of Brazil, Rodrigues Alves He's interesting because he was very pro-vaccine and in his first term of office... ...he actually... ...instigated something, or... He put in a policy of mandatory vaccination that led to something called the vaccine revolt So, yeah. He was a big proponent of medical science... ...actually to the point where... ...people ended up rising up against him because they didn't like... ...medical teams breaking down their doors and forcing them to get vaccinations. Understandable We also have Clementine Churchill, wife of Winston Churchill... John and Horace Dodge, brothers who founded  Dodge Motor Company... Kings, Kaiser Wilhelm, King George the Fifth of the United Kingdom... Haile Selassie, Emperor of Ethiopia, probably mispronouncing that, I'm sorry... King Alfonso XIII of Spain... writers and artists: T.S. Eliot; Raymond Chandler; DH Lawrence; Franz Kafka... Georgia O'Keefe, the American painter; Edvard Munch, who painted a self-portrait while he had Spanish flu called, ""Self-Portrait with Spanish Flu"" Austrian painters Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, they both died I wanted to repeat that because if Klimt did die from Spanish fluid, it argues for an earlier emergence We have it being in 1917--1918 It would have had to have come east into Europe If Klimt died from it, we're still not sure. A bunch of silent film actresses including Mary Pickford and Lillian Gish survived Margaret Dumont, who is the rich widow in all the Marx Brothers movies, was a Spanish Flu survivor And in religion, in 1917, three shepherd children reported seeing a vision of the Virgin Mary in the Portuguese parish of Fatima After a series of miracles, prophecies, and Marian apparitions... ...which are still remembered and venerated today as Our Lady of Fatima... ...two of the children made a prophecy that they would die in the Spanish Flu outbreak And unfortunately, it came true. They died. That was their last prophecy So finally: Walpole We've got a little unusual one today So... I have a... ...little excerpt from a diary from Horace and that Horace Walpole kept during a flu epidemic in 1743 ""The last ships have brought over all your epidemic distempers; not a family in London has scaped under five or six ill... ...many people have been forced to hire new laborers. Guernier, the apothecary, took two new apprentices, and yet could not drug all his patients ""It has a cold and fever. I had one of the worst, and was blooded on Saturday and Sunday."" He means bleeding ""But it is quite gone; my father was blooded last night; this is but slight ""The physicians say there has been nothing like it since the year thirty-three, and then not so bad... ""...[the bill of mortality --the death rate-- mostly the same]; in short our army abroad would shudder to see what streams of blood have been let out"" Of course his father is Robert Walpole. How does this connect the 1918 flu pandemic? Well, flu strains are related It's very likely, or possible I should say, rather than likely, that the Spanish Flu was a descendant of this flu Thanks for joining us today. Come back next week We'll be heading down to the Indonesian archipelago and the island of Java... ...where we'll see Hindu Buddhist kingdoms war for control over the lucrative spice trade It's gonna be a ton of backstabbing and Mongol fleets... ...and probably one of the tricksiest characters we have ever had on Extra History This guy is neat. Tune in, there's gonna be war from elephant back and all sorts of neat stuff So, see you next week when we explore the kingdom of Majapahit "
443,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,gGeLxjgUNG4,"Imagine that day by day, your field of vision  becomes slightly smaller, narrowing or dimming until eventually you go completely blind. We tend to think of blindness as something you're born with, but in fact, with many diseases like Retinitis pigmentosa and Usher syndrome, blindness can start developing when you're a kid, or even when you're an adult. Both of these rare genetic diseases affect the retina, the screen at the back of the eye that detects light and helps us see. Now imagine if the eye  could regenerate itself so that a blind person could see again. To understand if that's possible, we need to grasp how the retina works and what it has to do with a multitalented creature named the zebrafish. The human retina is made of different layers of cells, with special neurons that live in the back of the eye called rod and cone photoreceptors. Photoreceptors convert  the light coming into your eye into signals that the brain uses  to generate vision. People who have Usher syndrome and retinitis pigmentosa experience a steady loss  of these photoreceptors until finally that screen in the eye can no longer detect light nor broadcast signals to the brain. Unlike most of your body's cells, photoreceptors don't divide and multiply. We're born with all the photoreceptors we'll ever have, which is why babies have such big eyes for their faces and part of why they're so cute. But that isn't the case for all animals. Take the zebrafish, a master regenerator. It can grow back its skin, bones, heart and retina after they've been damaged. If photoreceptors in the zebrafish retina are removed or killed by toxins, they just regenerate and rewire themselves to the brain to restore sight. Scientists have been investigating this superpower because zebrafish retina are also structured very much like human retina. Scientists can even mimic the effects of disorders like Usher syndrome or retinitis pigmentosa on the zebrafish eye. This allows them to see how zebrafish go about repairing their retinas so they might use similar tactics to fix human eyes one day, too. So what's behind  the zebrafish's superpower? The main players are sets of long cells that stretch across the retina called Müller glia. When the photoreceptors are damaged, these cells transform, taking on a new character. They become less like Müller cells and more like stem cells, which can turn into any kind of cell. Then these long cells divide, producing extras that will eventually grow into new photoreceptors, travel to the back of the eye and rewire themselves into the brain. And now some researchers even think they've found the key to how this works with the help of one of two chemicals that create activity in the brain called glutamate and aminoadipate. In mouse eyes, these make the Müller glia divide and transform into photoreceptors, which then travel  to the back of the retina, like they're replenishing a failing army with new soldiers. But remember, none of this has happened in our retinas yet, so the question is how do we trigger  this transformation of the Müller glia in the human eye? How can we fully control this process? How do photoreceptors rewire themselves into the retina? And is it even possible to trigger this in humans? Or has this mechanism been lost over time in evolution? Until we tease apart  the origins of this ability, retinal regeneration will remain  a mysterious superpower of the common zebrafish. "
444,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,gQbZX9JEQsQ,"When Homer’s Iliad was first written  down in the 8th century BCE, the story of the Trojan war  was already an old one. From existing oral tradition, audiences knew the tales  of the long siege, the epic duels outside the city walls, and the cunning trick that finally won the war. In the end, the magnificent city was burned to the ground, never to rise again. But had it ever existed? By the time the field of archaeology  began to take shape in the 19th century, many were skeptical, considering the epic to be pure fiction, a founding myth imagining  a bygone heroic era. But some scholars believed that behind the superhuman feats  and divine miracles there must have been a grain  of historical truth - a war that was really fought, and a place where it happened. Frank Calvert was one such believer. He had spent his youth traveling and learning about ancient civilizations before accompanying his brother Frederick on a diplomatic mission to the northwest Anatolian region of Çanakkale. It was here that Homer described  the Greek encampment at the mouth of the Scamander river. And it was here that fate brought Frank into contact with a journalist and geologist  named Charles Maclaren. Locals and travelers had long speculated that Troy might’ve stood on one of the surrounding hilltops. But Maclaren had been one of the first to publish a detailed topographical  study of the area. He believed he had found the site – a 32-meter mound known by the name Hisarlık, derived from the Turkish word  for “fortress.” Soon after meeting with him in 1847, the Calverts bought 2,000 acres of farmland that included part of the hill. Before they could explore any further, the Crimean War broke out and forestalled their archaeological  ambitions for several years. After the war’s end, Frank Calvert began to survey the site, but lacked the funds  for a full excavation. This was where the wealthy German businessman and amateur archaeologist  Heinrich Schliemann came in. At Calvert’s invitation, Schliemann visited the grounds in 1868, and decided to excavate. Eager to find the ancient city, Schliemann tore massive trenches  all the way to the base of the hill. There, he uncovered a hoard  of precious artifacts, jewelry, and metalwork, including two diadems  and a copper shield. Schliemann took full credit for the discovery, announcing that he had found Troy and the treasure of its king Priam. But the real treasure was elsewhere. When later archaeologists  studied the site, they realized that the mound consisted  of no less than nine cities, each built atop the ruins of the last. The layer Schliemann had uncovered dated back to the Mycenaean Age, more than 1,000 years too early  for Homer. But inside the mound was indeed evidence for a city that had thrived during the Bronze Age, with charred stone, broken arrowheads, and damaged human skeletons  suggesting a violent end. It was Troy VII, contained in the middle layers and now ravaged for a second time by Schliemann’s careless excavation. The settlement, spanning some 200,000 square meters and home to as many as 10,000 people, thrived until around 1180 BCE. Its position at the southern entrance of the Dardanelles strait would’ve made a formidable strategic location for both defense and trade. Most importantly, there are the remains of a massive fortification wall – perhaps the very same one from which Priam and Hector  once watched the Greeks approach. Of course, it’s difficult to be certain that these ruins are the true remains of ancient Troy, and scholars still dispute whether the Trojan War as described by Homer ever happened. Yet the evidence is strong enough that UNESCO has labelled Hisarlık the archeological site of Troy. Regardless of its identity, thanks to persistence, a bit of faith, and a lot of research, archaeologists are bringing  the long-buried secrets of an ancient, lost city to light. "

But after billions of dollars in research, we haven't found a solution for a disease that affects more than 14 million people and their families at any given time. Cancer arises as normal cells accumulate mutations. Most of the time, cells can detect mutations or DNA damage and either fix them or self destruct. However, some mutations allow cancerous cells to grow unchecked and invade nearby tissues, or even metastasize to distant organs. Cancers become almost incurable once they metastasize. And cancer is incredibly complex. It's not just one disease. There are more than 100 different types and we don't have a magic bullet that can cure all of them. For most cancers, treatments usually include a combination of surgery to remove tumors and radiation and chemotherapy to kill any cancerous cells left behind. Hormone therapies, immunotherapy, and targeted treatments tailored for a specific type of cancer are sometimes used, too. In many cases,  these treatments are effective and the patient becomes cancer-free. But they're very far from 100% effective 100% of the time. So what would we have to do to find cures for all the different forms of cancer? We're beginning to understand a few of the problems scientists would have to solve. First of all, we need new, better ways of studying cancer. Most cancer treatments are developed using cell lines grown in labs from cultures of human tumors. These cultured cells have given us critical insights about cancer genetics and biology, but they lack much of the complexity of a tumor in an actual living organism. It's frequently the case that new drugs, which work on these lab-grown cells, will fail in clinical trials  with real patients. One of the complexities of aggressive tumors is that they can have multiple populations of slightly different cancerous cells. Over time, distinct genetic mutations accumulate in cells in different parts of the tumor, giving rise to unique subclones. For example, aggressive brain tumors called glioblastomas can have as many as six different subclones in a single patient. This is called clonal heterogeneity, and it makes treatment difficult because a drug that works on one subclone may have no effect on another. Here's another challenge. A tumor is a dynamic interconnected ecosystem where cancer cells constantly communicate with each other and with healthy cells nearby. They can induce normal cells to form blood vessels that feed the tumor and remove waste products. They can also interact  with the immune system to actually suppress its function, keeping it from recognizing or destroying the cancer. If we could learn how to shut down these lines of communication, we'd have a better shot at vanquishing a tumor permanently. Additionally, mounting evidence suggests we'll need to figure out how to eradicate cancer stem cells. These are rare but seem  to have special properties that make them resistant to chemotherapy and radiation. In theory, even if the rest of the tumor shrinks beyond detection during treatment, a single residual cancer stem cell could seed the growth of a new tumor. Figuring out how to target these stubborn cells might help prevent cancers  from coming back. Even if we solved those problems, we might face new ones. Cancer cells are masters of adaptation, adjusting their molecular and cellular characteristics to survive under stress. When they're bombarded by radiation or chemotherapy, some cancer cells can effectively switch on protective shields against whatever's attacking them by changing their gene expression. Malignant cancers are complex systems that constantly evolve and adapt. To defeat them, we need to find experimental systems that match their complexity, and monitoring and treatment options that can adjust as the cancer changes. But the good news is we're making progress. Even with all we don't know, the average mortality rate for most kinds of cancer has dropped significantly since the 1970s and is still falling. We're learning more every day, and each new piece of information gives us one more tool to add to our arsenal. "

The village was nine thousand years old, so old that the people who lived died and were buried there, didn't have basic technologies like pottery or the wheel. What they did have was Tuberculosis. TB has followed us like a shadow for the entirety of human history. We found it in the lung tissue of Egyptian mummies, and references to it in the Bible, Vedic texts, and the work of Hippocrates. Infected seals appear to have carried it to South America long before the Columbian Exchange. It is the closest thing humanity has  to a biological nemesis and in 1944 we found a cure.

Though Robert Koch's tuberculin failed to become the cure doctors hoped for, by tuberculin's rollout in 1891, experts in other fields were already finding ways to combat tuberculosis. Koch's mistake was  that he bought into the myth of the Scientific Genius the idea that one man could destroy a malady with the strength of his intelligence. But in reality, that's not  how science works in the modern world. In fact, it would take a team of scientists in different fields to cure the white plague and an even larger group of non scientists to implement that cure. Indeed, before Koch  began working on tuberculosis, Public Health Initiatives and medical technologies were already lowering the TB rate  in Europe and North America. In cities where people lived close and had the highest rate of infection health department's launched ad campaigns, encouraging the public to cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing. They banned spittoons and punished spitting on the street with a fine. Labor unions and reformers advocated for larger factory spaces, so workers weren't crushed up against each other. Hospitals created separate TB warts to safeguard other patients. Doctors used new detection techniques like the stethoscope and the x-ray to identify cases early and and Koch's tuberculin though a failure as a cure flourished as a diagnostic test, and in 1908 a gathering of scientists determined that a type of tuberculosis called Scrofula which caused sores and lesions rather than lung infection, existed in cows and could be passed to humans via milk. It turned out that briefly boiling  the milk in a process called pasteurization after Louis Pasteur solved the problem. Unfortunately, public skepticism meant pasteurization wouldn't be widely accepted until World War Two but once implemented, Scrofula rates plummeted. But this discovery of a link between bovine and human Tuberculosis was exciting for another reason. It provided hope for a vaccine. After all, the first smallpox vaccine came from a similar situation, where doctors inoculated patients with the less deadly cow pox in order to guard their systems against smallpox. The problem was that unlike cow pox,  bovine tuberculosis was extremely deadly to humans. It took a French team 13 years to create a strain weak enough that it would build immunity in a subject without infecting them with full-blown TB, but the resulting vaccine known as BCG finally entered human trials in 1921 and it remains the most common tuberculosis vaccine to this day. But BCG was not a cure. It could guard an immune system for a decade, sure, but it couldn't help a patient after they got sick. To find that magical substance, Science would have to delve into the most exotic and a mysterious biological stew known to man. The dirt of New Jersey. Bluahh Selman Waksman was a soil scientist at Rutgers, a professor who studied the biochemistry and microbiology of dirt. At first he evaluated the microbes for possible agricultural purposes, but after the discovery of penicillin in 1928, he increasingly searched for antibiotics, a term he popularized that would prove effective against penicillin resistant bacteria. He was essentially searching for microbes that would assassinate other microbes Over four decades Waxman and his team cultured 10,000 species of microbes from New Jersey dirt and other natural sources. Of those, only one was an effective antibiotic that could also be produced in sufficient quantity: Streptomycin and tests in 1944 proved that Streptomycin could kill Tuberculosis. They kept it quiet at first; after all everyone remembered what happened with Robert Koch and tuberculin, and he was one of the greatest medical minds in history. They kept the tests small and under tight controls, rolling it out slowly by trying it on troops returning from the war. But it was the British who proved its effectiveness with the world's first randomized clinical trial, a process that would become standard procedure for new drugs between 1946 and 1948, British doctors administered Streptomycin to a group of random patients, while comparing them to a control group with similar stages of tuberculosis. This plan came about not due to scientific rigor but post-war belt-tightening. The British government could only afford so much of the rare drug, and they wanted to make sure the data they got back from it was as clean as possible. But while the initial results looked good, once the treatment ran out, the patients taking streptomycin took a turn for the worse. They discovered a fact that would bedevil tuberculosis researchers for decades. Unless killed off completely, TB is extremely good at developing resistance to antibiotics. Luckily the Swedish researchers Jorgen Lehmann and Carl Gustav- Rosdoe had synthesized an acid, PAS, that could inhibit the bacterias' metabolism. The British team tried using it on their resurgent microbes. It was the first combination drug therapy, and it worked for the first time in human history. There was a cure for tuberculosis and that discovery wasn't down to one brilliant scientist. It was a team effort, a fact highlighted in 1952 when Waxman received the Nobel Prize for Streptomycin despite the fact that his student Albert Schatz had actually made the discovery. An ugly lawsuit ensued. Eventually winning, Schatz co-credit and royalties from the drug. Within a decade, a new battery of for anti TB drugs had pushed Streptomycin and PAS into the background, things to be brought out when the front line drugs failed, and it was important to have them in reserve, because despite having a cure in hand, Tuberculosis revealed a certain stubbornness. It absolutely refused to die. Because, to kill tuberculosis and I mean really, permanently, kill it a patient, has to take a course of antibiotics that lasts weeks. In fact, they have to continue taking Antibiotics even after they feel better, which is difficult since the drugs themselves can have side effects, ranging from nausea to hearing loss. Many patients quit, letting the microbe come roaring back, resistant to the antibiotics that treated it, even when resistance isn't the problem. Persistence can play a role. When antibiotics attack TB, the vast majority of microbes will die at a quick steady rate But a few will enter a kind of hibernation and persist, not immune, but waiting it out. Tricky little buggers, not to mention, the drugs themselves were expensive. Meaning that while Tuberculosis became rarer and rarer in the developed world, it still burned on in India, East Asia, Africa and Latin America. and as patients received treatment, but didn't finish the course, more antibiotic resistant strains emerged. These strains required longer courses of treatment, some, up to a year of doses totaling 20,000 pills and multiple approaches to make sure it died. These longer courses of antibiotics, along with hospitalization might cost a million dollars per patient. But in the early 1980s overseas charities and hospitals were making headway for a brief moment, it seemed like the 10,000 year dream was possible. We could eradicate TB like we had smallpox but two things changed the balance: fast international travel and AIDS. With a quick plane flight, drug-resistant tuberculosis could spread to areas where it had been nearly wiped out. and where doctors had stopped screening for it. and with the rise of HIV AIDS it found a new immunocompromised subset of the population to infect. Particularly in places like South Africa , where medical care was harder to obtain, the White Plague once again threatened to become a fact of life. But there's no need to panic, and there's cause for hope. Currently, the World Health Organization governments and medical charities like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are throwing resources into new low-cost diagnostic tests and improved vaccines, and there are new drugs in the testing phases that may help us combat these new Antibiotic resistant strains. And local doctors are much more diligent about keeping TB on their radar when diagnosing patients. The battle between humanity and tuberculosis rages on, and beating it will be a team effort between governments, scientists, health care professionals, and you. In fact, the single biggest thing you can do to stop the spread of drug-resistant strains of, well anything really, not just TB, is to make sure you finish a full course of Antibiotics when you're sick, and look, we know that can SUCK. Actually, Rob wrote this while taking some pretty unfun Antibiotics for bronchitis, but as much as he dislikes those pills he's going to take all of them, so the next person doesn't get infected with something worse. We've cured tuberculosis, but we still have to beat it, and that takes everyone, including you. So do your part, and breathe easy my friends. Once again, thanks so much to Child and Teen Checkups programs for sponsoring this series! Tuberculosis isn't as common as it once was, but it does still exist. Children should receive a health check-up every year and, Doctors can ask questions to find out if your child is at risk. If you live in Minnesota, learn more at get CTC com.

447,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,hLgh1pJP5ng,"Symmetry is everywhere in nature, and we usually associate it with beauty: a perfectly shaped leaf, or a butterfly with intricate patterns mirrored on each wing. But it turns out that asymmetry is pretty important, too, and more common than you might think, from crabs with one giant pincer claw to snail species whose shells' always coil in the same direction. Some species of beans only climb up their trellises clockwise, others, only counterclockwise, and even though the human body looks pretty symmetrical on the outside, it's a different story on the inside. Most of your vital organs  are arranged asymmetrically. The heart, stomach, spleen, and pancreas lie towards the left. The gallbladder and most of your liver are on the right. Even your lungs are different. The left one has two lobes, and the right one has three. The two sides of your brain look similar, but function differently. Making sure this asymmetry is distributed the right way is critical. If all your internal organs are flipped, a condition called situs inversus, it's often harmless. But incomplete reversals can be fatal, especially if the heart is involved. But where does this asymmetry come from, since a brand-new embryo looks identical on the right and left. One theory focuses  on a small pit on the embryo called a node. The node is lined with tiny hairs called cilia, while tilt away from the head and whirl around rapidly, all in the same direction. This synchronized rotation pushes fluid from the right side of the embryo to the left. On the node's left-hand rim, other cilia sense this fluid flow and activate specific genes on the embryo's left side. These genes direct the cells to make certain proteins, and in just a few hours, the right and left sides of the embryo are chemically different. Even though they still look the same, these chemical differences are eventually translated into asymmetric organs. Asymmetry shows up in the heart first. It begins as a straight tube along the center of the embryo, but when the embryo  is around three weeks old, the tube starts to bend into a c-shape and rotate towards the right side of the body. It grows different  structures on each side, eventually turning into the familiar asymmetric heart. Meanwhile, the other major organs emerge from a central tube and grow towards their ultimate positions. But some organisms, like pigs, don't have those embryonic cilia and still have asymmetric internal organs. Could all cells be  intrinsically asymmetric? Probably. Bacterial colonies grow lacy branches that all curl in the same direction, and human cells cultured  inside a ring-shaped boundary tend to line up like the ridges on a cruller. If we zoom in even more, we see that many of cells' basic building blocks, like nucleic acids, proteins, and sugars, are inherently asymmetric. Proteins have complex asymmetric shapes, and those proteins control  which way cells migrate and which way embryonic cilia twirl. These biomolecules have a property called chirality, which means that a molecule and its mirror image aren't identical. Like your right and left hands, they look the same, but trying to put your right in your left glove proves they're not. This asymmetry at the molecular level is reflected in asymmetric cells, asymmetric embryos, and finally asymmetric organisms. So while symmetry may be beautiful, asymmetry holds an allure of its own, found in its graceful whirls, its organized complexity, and its striking imperfections. "

You probably don’t think much about the bodies of these building blocks, but at the microscopic level, small  changes can have huge consequences. And while some adaptations change  these shapes for the better, others can spark a cascade of  debilitating complications. This is the story of sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease affects the red blood cells, which transport oxygen from the lungs to all the tissues in the body. To perform this vital task, red blood cells are filled with hemoglobin proteins to carry oxygen molecules. These proteins float independently inside the red blood cell’s pliable, doughnut-like shape, keeping the cells flexible enough to accommodate even the tiniest of blood vessels. But in sickle cell disease, a single genetic mutation alters the structure of hemoglobin. After releasing oxygen to tissues, these mutated proteins lock together into rigid rows. Rods of hemoglobin cause the cell to deform into a long, pointed sickle. These red blood cells are harder and stickier, and no longer flow smoothly through  blood vessels. Sickled cells snag and pile up– sometimes blocking the vessel completely. This keeps oxygen from reaching a variety of cells, causing the wide range of symptoms experienced by people with sickle-cell disease. Starting when they’re  less than a year old, patients suffer from repeated episodes of stabbing pain in oxygen-starved tissues. The location of the clogged vessel determines the specific  symptoms experienced. A blockage in the spleen, part of the immune system, puts patients at risk for  dangerous infections. A pileup in the lungs can produce  fevers and difficulty breathing. A clog near the eye can cause vision  problems and retinal detachment. And if the obstructed vessels  supply the brain the patient could even suffer a stroke. Worse still, sickled red blood cells also don’t survive very long— just 10 or 20 days, versus a healthy cell’s 4 months. This short lifespan means that patients live with a constantly depleted supply of red blood cells; a condition called sickle-cell anemia. Perhaps what’s most surprising about this malignant mutation is that it originally evolved as a beneficial adaptation. Researchers have been able to trace the origins of the sickle cell mutation to regions historically ravaged by a tropical disease called malaria. Spread by a parasite found in local mosquitoes, malaria uses red blood cells as incubators to spread quickly and lethally  through the bloodstream. However, the same structural changes that turn red blood cells into roadblocks also make them more resistant to malaria. And if a child inherits a copy of the mutation from only one parent, there will be just enough abnormal  hemoglobin to make life difficult for the  malaria parasite, while most of their red blood cells retain their normal shape and function. In regions rife with this parasite, sickle cell mutation offered a serious evolutionary advantage. But as the adaptation flourished, it became clear that inheriting the  mutation from both parents resulted in sickle-cell anemia. Today, most people with  sickle-cell disease can trace their ancestry to a country where malaria is endemic. And this mutation still plays a key role in Africa, where more than 90% of malaria  infections occur worldwide. Fortunately, as this “adaptation” thrives, our treatment for sickle cell continues  to improve. For years, hydroxyurea was the only  medication available to reduce the amount of sickling, blunting symptoms and increasing life expectancy. Bone marrow transplantations offer a curative measure, but these procedures are complicated and often inaccessible. But promising new medications are intervening in novel ways, like keeping oxygen bonded to hemoglobin to prevent sickling, or reducing the stickiness  of sickled cells. And the ability to edit DNA has raised the possibility of enabling stem cells to produce normal hemoglobin. As these tools become available in the areas most affected by malaria and sickle cell disease, we can improve the quality of life for more patients with this adverse adaptation. "

Or just a sign of the brutality of the Middle Ages. Senseless warfone destruction; the death of thousands in the mud of France for nothing more than the greed and ambition of Kings. There's all of this and more in the Hundred Years War. It's a story of courage, the clash of nations A story of human endeavor and the timeless struggle for supremacy. Yet there's also another story here: the story of a war that helped define England. Her sense of herself, her language, her role in the world. The Hundred Years War helped form a nation. Welcome to the Extra History of England. It's 1328. The new King of England is a young man called But he's powerless. Because his mother's lover a man named Roger Mortimer had seized control of his throne. But Edward was a warrior and a leader of men. In 1330 at the age of only 17 he gathered some friends and by pale moonlight snuck into Mortimer's castle. He cut down the guards and seized Mortimer himself. The interloper was dragged through the jeering crowds of London, dragged to the gallows known as the tyburn tree where countless traitors would die over the centuries and hung by the neck until dead. From that point Edward was determined that England and his royal court would be a shining example of culture to all Christendom. The court of the young King was a pageant of color, music, tournaments, and poetry. He surrounded himself with the enormously wealthy nobility and modeled his court on the glory of the ancient and mythical Camelot of King Arthur: A celebration of the cult of chivalry. But part of that cult was that the King would lead his nobles to war, wealth, and glory. And while at times the nobility did strain against the King's authority, for the most part they were his natural allies, holding their lands from him and working with him to govern his kingdom and his people. And so, with his greatest Nobles at his side Edward did what he loved most and was born for: he led his nobility to war and crushed the Scots in battle. But then in 1337 Edward's world was threatened: the French were at the gates. Well, not the literal gates. Actually, it's a complex dynastic claim involving several hundred years of medieval inheritance law and international politics. We should be able to cover that in just a few sentences. For centuries the French and English royal dynasties had fought over land in France. In the blue corner, the French royal dynasty: the Valois. And in the red corner, the English Royal Dynasty: the Plantagenets. And the Valois King of France, King Philip VI of France was determined to take the last of Edward's French lands away from him, because medieval kingdoms didn't follow modern borders or rules. They were the property of a King and his nobles. English claims in France went all the way back to 1066 when a French noble called William the Bastard decided that he deserved more than the lands he held in Normandy. He made the most of a distant claim to the English throne, sailed across the channel, beat up the English and became known to history as The old Anglo-Saxon landowners were swept away, and England became the property of French-speaking Lords. French was the language of the nobility, of literature, of the Kings Court; English was the language of the peasant, and the serf. Fast forward a hundred years and in 1155 a young man called Henry became King Henry II of England. Henry came from Anjou in France. And so more French land was added to those holdings in Normandy that came from old Willy the Conq. Plus Henry then married the richest heiress in Europe who was good way of paying the bills the powerful cultured and intelligent Eleanor of Aquitaine And she brought even more French land to the English crown. Henry and his successors the Plantagenet royal family now owned almost half of modern France. They spoke French. They loved France. They were French. If they had to choose between a croissant and a full English breakfast it'll be the croissant every time. But there's a catch. Most of these lands where in theory still owned by the kings of France. Like all medieval vassels, everyone with lands in France were supposed to kneel and pay homage to the Valois kings for them. In practice though, the likes of Willy the Conq and Henry II were simply too powerful to be forced to do what the Valois told them to do. So they just paid lip service to the French King's theoretical rights, and got on with the party. But over the centuries, bit by bit, the Valois had used their rights to take back most of that land while weaker Plantagenet were on the English throne. By the time Edward III was born most of that land had been successfully reclaimed by the French, leaving only a single province left in English hands: a place called Gascony. The Valois King Philip VI was determined to take that last province away from the Plantagenet and England. Philip had no doubt he could achieve this. After all, France was the most powerful and glorious country in all Christendom. It was one of the leading centers of culture and learning. Philip only counted as his equals: the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor and that's it. England was just a small damp and slightly grubby country somewhere in the North Sea. The French nobility with a shining exemplar of chivalry, while the English nobility were not. Phillip made trouble for Edward. He made an alliance with the Scots against the English And then at his cout in 1337, he formally confiscated Gascony. Edward tried to talk. Philip told him to talk to the hand. Edward told him to talk to the edge of his sword; he would defend his rights. The confiscation was not just an insult to Edward, It was also a threat to English merchants. England had two great sources of wealth: One was in the wine trade with Gascony, the Gascon merchants as well as the English hated the idea of losing the wine trade with England. Even more important though was the wool trade with the county of Flanders in the modern-day Belgium. The textile industry was far and away the biggest industry in medieval Europe other than agriculture. No other industry was a fraction of its value and the textile industry was dominated by the densely populated towns of northern Italy and Flanders. English wool fed that trade. English wool was the best in all Europe, finer with longer strands making it easier to set it to yarn and creating the softest, strongest woolen cloth. Every year, thousands of huge wool sacks were sold to Flemish merchants, and every year customs dews from the trade filled the English Treasury. But the Count of Flanders was a subject of the French King and now King Philip told Flanders they could no longer trade with the English. The Flemish were as horrified as the English without English wool, their industry would die and that people would starve. So one Friday in the bustling market square in Ghent in Flanders, the people gathered excitedly round a wooden stage. It was covered with colourful pennants and flags. But they saw a new flag the arms of England quartered with the royal arms of France, and they wondered what that could mean. A young powerful man stepped forward. His name, he declared, was King Edward the Third. He had been wrongfully banned from his lands in France and he would reclaim his right. The people cheered. But there was more: by the right of his French mother He was claiming the very throne of France itself. The Flemish cheered. The French giggled. War was now unstoppable. At stake on the English side was trade, the English role in Christendom, the King's lands in France, held by right for a hundred and fifty years, and the reputation and honor of the King. On the French side: a unified country, national prestige, and the right of their monarch to his throne So join us next time as these two great kings marshal their forces and the Hundred Years War begins in earnest.

450,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,itpLU7OzNV8,"We know about our universe’s past: the Big Bang theory predicts that all matter, time, and space began in an incredibly tiny, compact state about 14 billion years ago. And we know about the present: scientists’ observations of the movement  of galaxies tell us that the universe is expanding  at an accelerated rate. But what about the future? Do we know how our universe  is going to end? Cosmologists have three  possible answers for this question, called the Big Freeze, the Big Rip and the Big Crunch. To understand these three scenarios, imagine two objects representing galaxies. A short, tight rubber band is  holding them together— that’s the attractive force of gravity. Meanwhile, two hooks are pulling them apart— that’s the repulsive force  expanding the universe. Copy this system over and over again, and you have something approximating the real universe. The outcome of the battle between these two opposing forces determines how the end of the  universe will play out. The Big Freeze scenario is what happens  if the force pulling the objects apart is just strong enough to stretch the  rubber band until it loses its elasticity. The expansion wouldn’t be able to  accelerate anymore, but the universe would keep  getting bigger. Clusters of galaxies would separate. The objects within the galaxies– suns, planets, and solar systems would move away from each other, until galaxies dissolved into  lonely objects floating separately in the vast space. The light they emit would be redshifted to long wavelengths with very low, faint energies, and the gas emanating from them  would be too thin to create new stars. The universe would become  darker and colder, approaching a frozen state also known as the Big Chill, or the Heat Death of the Universe. But what if the repulsive force  is so strong that it stretches the rubber band past its elastic limit, and actually tears it? If the expansion of the universe continues to accelerate, it will eventually overcome not only the gravitational force – tearing apart galaxies and solar systems– but also the electromagnetic, weak,  and strong nuclear forces which hold atoms and nuclei together. As a result, the matter that makes up stars  breaks into tiny pieces. Even atoms and subatomic particles  will be destroyed. That’s the Big Rip. What about the third scenario, where the rubber band wins out? That corresponds to a possible future in which the force of gravity brings the universe’s expansion to a halt— and then reverses it. Galaxies would start rushing  towards each other, and as they clumped together their gravitational pull would  get even stronger. Stars too would hurtle together and collide. Temperatures would rise as space would get tighter and tighter. The size of the universe would plummet until everything compressed into such  a small space that even atoms and subatomic particles  would have to crunch together. The result would be an incredibly dense, hot, compact universe — a lot like the state that  preceded the Big Bang. This is the Big Crunch. Could this tiny point of matter explode  in another Big Bang? Could the universe expand and contract over and over again, repeating its entire history? The theory describing such a universe is known as the Big Bounce. In fact, there’s no way to tell how many bounces could’ve already happened— or how many might happen in the future. Each bounce would wipe away any record of the universe’s previous history. Which one of those scenarios  will be the real one? The answer depends on the exact shape  of the universe, the amount of dark energy it holds, and changes in its expansion rate. As of now, our observations suggest  that we’re heading for a Big Freeze. But the good news is that we’ve probably  got about 10 to the 100th power years before the chill sets in — so don’t start stocking up  on mittens just yet. "
451,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,jLesc5lITvo,"Few individuals have influenced the world and many of today's thinkers like Plato. One 20th century philosopher even went so far as to describe all of Western philosophy as a series of footnotes to Plato. He created the first Western university and was teacher to Ancient Greece's  greatest minds, including Aristotle. But even one of the founders of philosophy wasn't perfect. Along with his great ideas, Plato had a few that haven't exactly stood the test of time. So here are brief rundowns of a few of his best and worst ideas. Plato argued that beyond our imperfect world was a perfect unchanging world of Forms. Forms are the ideal versions of the things and concepts we see around us. They serve as a sort of instruction manual to our own world. Floating around the world of Forms is the ideal tree, and the ideal YouTube channel, and even the ideal justice, or ideal love. Our own reality is comprised of imperfect copies of ideal Forms. Plato argued that philosophers should strive to contemplate and understand these perfect Forms so that they may better navigate our misleading reality. While it may seem silly, the disconnect between the world as it appears and the greater truth behind it is one of philosophy's most vexing problems. It's been the subject of thousands of pages by theologians, philosophers, and screenwriters alike. It raises questions like should we trust our senses to come to the truth or our own reason? For Plato, the answer is reason. It alone provides us with at least the potential to contemplate the Forms. But reason didn't always pan out for Plato himself. When he sought to situate humankind amongst the animals, he lumped us in with birds. ""Featherless bipeds""  was his official designation. Diogenes the Cynic, annoyed by this definition, stormed into Plato's class with a plucked chicken, announcing, ""Behold. Plato's man."" But back to a few good ideas. Plato is one of the earliest political theorists on record, and with Aristotle, is seen as one of the founders of political science. He reasoned that being a ruler was no different than any other craft, whether a potter or doctor, and that only those who had mastered the craft were fit to lead. Ruling was the craft  of contemplating the Forms. In his Republic, Plato imagined a utopia where justice is the ultimate goal. Plato's ideal city seeks a harmonious balance between its individual parts and should be lead by a philosopher king. Millennia before his time, Plato also reasoned that women were equally able to rule in this model city. Unfortunately, Plato was inconsistent with women, elsewhere likening them to children. He also believed that a woman's womb was a live animal that could wander around in her body and cause illness. This bad idea, also espoused by other contemporaries of Plato, was sadly influential for hundreds of years in European medicine. Furthermore, he thought that society should be divided into three groups: producers, the military, and the rulers, and that a great noble lie should convince everyone to follow this structure. The noble lie he proposed was that we're all born with gold, silver, or a mixture of brass and iron in our souls, which determine our roles in life. Some thinkers have gone on to credit the idea of the noble lie as a prototype for 20th century propaganda, and the philosopher king as inspiration for the dictators that used them. Should a few bad ideas tarnish Plato's status as one of the greatest philosophers in history? No! Plato gave the leaders and thinkers who came after him a place to start. Through the centuries, we've had the chance to test those ideas through writing and experience, and have accepted some while rejecting others. We are continuing to refine, amend, and edit his ideas which have become foundations of the modern world. "
452,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,jP-9AD0wMOk,"Just between your chest and abdomen is where you’ll find one of the most important muscles you probably didn't know you had: the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES. When functioning properly, this ring of tissue plays a crucial role in helping us eat. But when the LES malfunctions, it becomes the main player in heartburn --a searing, sometimes sour-tasting chest-spasm that many people will experience at some point in their lives. We know that humans have been battling heartburn for hundreds, if not thousands of years. But recently the incidence has risen, making it a common stomach  complaint worldwide. When the symptoms of heartburn become more more regular and intense —such as twice a week or more-- it’s diagnosed as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease, or GERD. But what causes this problem, and how can it be stopped? Heartburn starts in an area called the gastroesophageal junction,  where the LES resides. This smooth, muscular ring of the LES is moderated by an intricate tree of nerve roots that connect to the brain,  the heart, and the lungs. After food enters the stomach from the esophagus, the muscle’s task is to stop it from surging back up again. The LES contracts, squeezing  the stomach entrance and creating a high pressure zone that prevents digestive acids from seeping out. But if the LES relaxes at the wrong moment or gradually weakens, it becomes like a faulty, ill-fitting lid, causing the area to depressurize. That allows burning stomach acid-- and even chunks of food--to spurt into the esophagus, sometimes going as far up as the mouth. The cause of all this internal drama has long been put down to diet. Foods like caffeine and peppermint contain ingredients that may have a relaxing affect on the LES, which makes it incapable of doing its job. Other acidic foods, like citrus and tomatoes, can worsen irritation of the esophagus when they leach out with stomach acid. Carbonated beverages can similarly bubble up in the stomach, forcing open the valve. But researchers have discovered that food isn’t the only trigger. Smoking poses a risk, because the nicotine in cigarettes relaxes the LES. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol may have a similar effect. Pregnant women often experience more heartburn due to the pressure of a growing baby on their stomachs. and the levels of certain hormones  in their bodies. Obesity can cause hernias that disrupt the anti-reflux barrier of the gastroesophageal junction that normally protects  against heartburn. Numerous medications,  including those for asthma, high blood pressure, birth control,  and depression can also have unintended effects on the LES. An occasional bout of heartburn isn't necessarily something to worry about. But, if heartburn starts happening regularly, it can weaken the LES muscle over time, letting more and more acid escape. And if it goes untreated, this can cause bigger problems. Over time, constant acid  leakage from heartburn may form scar tissue which narrows the esophageal tube, making it harder to swallow food. Ongoing reflux can also damage the cells lining the esophagus--a rare condition called Barrett’s esophagus, which can elevate the risk of esophageal cancer. Luckily, heartburn is often treatable with a range of medicines that can help neutralize or reduce stomach acid. In extreme cases, some people have surgery to tighten the LES to  minimize their distress. But we can often stop heartburn before it reaches that point. Reducing the consumption  of certain foods, not smoking, and maintaining  a healthy weight can all dramatically reduce reflux. With proper care we can  help our LES’s keep the chemical fountain of  our stomachs in proper order and avoid having to feel the burn. "

454,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,jf_4z4AKwJg,"In medieval times, alchemists tried to achieve  the seemingly impossible. They wanted to transform lowly lead into gleaming gold. History portrays these people as aged eccentrics, but if only they'd known that their dreams were actually achievable. Indeed, today we can  manufacture gold on Earth thanks to modern inventions that those medieval alchemists missed by a few centuries. But to understand how this precious metal became embedded in our planet to start with, we have to gaze upwards at the stars. Gold is extraterrestrial. Instead of arising  from the planet's rocky crust, it was actually cooked up in space and is present on Earth because of cataclysmic stellar explosions called supernovae. Stars are mostly made up of hydrogen, the simplest and lightest element. The enormous gravitational pressure of so much material compresses and triggers nuclear fusion in the star's core. This process releases energy from the hydrogen, making the star shine. Over many millions of years, fusion transforms hydrogen  into heavier elements: helium, carbon, and oxygen, burning subsequent elements faster and faster to reach iron and nickel. However, at that point nuclear fusion no longer releases enough energy, and the pressure from the core peters out. The outer layers collapse into the center, and bouncing back from this sudden injection of energy, the star explodes forming a supernova. The extreme pressure of a collapsing star is so high, that subatomic protons and electrons are forced together in the core, forming neutrons. Neutrons have no repelling electric charge so they're easily captured by the iron group elements. Multiple neutron captures enable the formation of heavier elements that a star under normal circumstances can't form, from silver to gold, past lead and on to uranium. In extreme contrast to the million year transformation of hydrogen to helium, the creation of the heaviest elements in a supernova takes place in only seconds. But what becomes of the gold after the explosion? The expanding supernova shockwave propels its elemental debris through the interstellar medium, triggering a swirling dance  of gas and dust that condenses into new stars and planets. Earth's gold was likely delivered this way before being kneaded into veins by geothermal activity. Billions of years later, we now extract this precious product by mining it, an expensive process that's compounded by gold's rarity. In fact, all of the gold  that we've mined in history could be piled into  just three Olympic-size swimming pools, although this represents a lot of mass because gold is about 20 times denser than water. So, can we produce more  of this coveted commodity? Actually, yes. Using particle accelerators, we can mimic the complex nuclear reactions that create gold in stars. But these machines can only construct gold atom by atom. So it would take almost the age  of the universe to produce one gram at a cost vastly exceeding  the current value of gold. So that's not a very good solution. But if we were to reach a hypothetical point where we'd mined  all of the Earth's buried gold, there are other places we could look. The ocean holds an estimated 20 million tons of dissolved gold but at extremely miniscule concentrations making its recovery too costly at present. Perhaps one day, we'll see gold rushes to tap the mineral wealth of the other planets of our solar system. And who knows? Maybe some future supernova  will occur close enough to shower us with its treasure and hopefully not eradicate all life on Earth in the process. "
455,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,jhRuUoTnA6g,"In 132 CE, Chinese polymath Zhang Heng presented the Han court with his latest invention. This large vase, he claimed, could tell them whenever an earthquake  occurred in their kingdom– including the direction  they should send aid. The court was somewhat skeptical, especially when the device triggered  on a seemingly quiet afternoon. But when messengers came  for help days later, their doubts turned to gratitude. Today, we no longer rely on pots to  identify seismic events, but earthquakes still offer a unique challenge to those trying to track them. So why are earthquakes so  hard to anticipate, and how could we get better at predicting them? To answer that, we need to understand some theories behind how earthquakes occur. Earth’s crust is made from several vast, jagged slabs of rock called tectonic plates, each riding on a hot, partially molten layer of Earth’s mantle. This causes the plates to  spread very slowly, at anywhere from 1 to 20 centimeters per year. But these tiny movements are powerful  enough to cause deep cracks in the interacting plates. And in unstable zones, the intensifying pressure may  ultimately trigger an earthquake. It’s hard enough to monitor these  miniscule movements, but the factors that turn shifts into  seismic events are far more varied. Different fault lines juxtapose  different rocks– some of which are stronger–or weaker– under pressure. Diverse rocks also react differently to friction and high temperatures. Some partially melt, and can release lubricating fluids made of superheated minerals that reduce fault line friction. But some are left dry, prone to dangerous build-ups of pressure. And all these faults are subject to  varying gravitational forces, as well as the currents of hot rocks moving throughout Earth’s mantle. So which of these hidden variables  should we be analyzing, and how do they fit into our  growing prediction toolkit? Because some of these forces occur  at largely constant rates, the behavior of the plates  is somewhat cyclical. Today, many of our most reliable clues  come from long-term forecasting, related to when and where earthquakes  have previously occurred. At the scale of millennia, this allows us to make predictions about when highly active faults, like the San Andreas, are overdue for a massive earthquake. But due to the many variables involved, this method can only predict  very loose timeframes. To predict more imminent events, researchers have investigated the vibrations Earth elicits before a quake. Geologists have long used seismometers to track and map these tiny shifts in the earth’s crust. And today, most smartphones are  also capable of recording primary seismic waves. With a network of phones around the globe, scientists could potentially  crowdsource a rich, detailed warning system that alerts  people to incoming quakes. Unfortunately, phones might not be able to provide the advance notice needed to enact safety protocols. But such detailed readings  would still be useful for prediction tools like NASA’s  Quakesim software, which can use a rigorous blend of  geological data to identify regions at risk. However, recent studies indicate the most telling signs of a quake might be invisible to all these sensors. In 2011, just before an earthquake struck the east coast of Japan, nearby researchers recorded surprisingly high concentrations of the radioactive isotope pair:  radon and thoron. As stress builds up in the crust right  before an earthquake, microfractures allow these gases  to escape to the surface. These scientists think that if we built a vast network of radon-thoron detectors in earthquake-prone areas, it could become a promising  warning system– potentially predicting quakes a week in advance. Of course, none of these technologies  would be as helpful as simply looking deep inside  the earth itself. With a deeper view we might be able to track and predict large-scale geological changes in real time, possibly saving tens of thousands of lives a year. But for now, these technologies can help us prepare and respond quickly to areas in need– without waiting for directions from a vase. "
456,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,jhcih25Z9vI,"Alexios Komnenos, Byzantine emperor, led his army to meet the Scythian hordes in battle. For good luck, he carried one of the holiest relics in Christendom: the veil that had belonged to the Virgin Mary. Unfortunately, it didn’t help. Not only was his army defeated, but as they fled, the Emperor was stabbed in the buttocks. To make matters worse, a strong wind made the relic too heavy to carry, so he stashed it in some bushes as he escaped. But even as he fled, he managed to slay some Scythians and rescue a few comrades. At least, this is how Alexios' daughter Anna recounted the story, writing nearly 60 years later. She spent the last decade of her long life creating a 500-page history of her father’s reign called The Alexiad. Written in Greek, the book was modeled after ancient Greek epics and historical writings. But Anna had a different, trickier task than the writers in these traditions: as a princess writing about her own family, she had to balance her loyalty to her kin with her obligation to portray events accurately, navigating issues like Alexios’s embarrassing stab to the buttocks. A lifetime of study and participation in her father’s government prepared Anna for this undertaking. Anna was born in 1083, shortly after her father seized control of the Roman Empire following a decade of brutal civil wars and revolts. The empire was deep in decline when he came to power, and threatened from all sides: by the Seljuk Turks in the East, the Normans in the West, and Scythian raiders to the north. Over the course of Anna’s childhood and adolescence, Alexios fought constant military campaigns to secure the frontiers of his empire, even striking up an uneasy alliance with the Crusaders. Meanwhile in Constantinople, Anna fought her own battle. She was expected to study subjects considered proper for a Byzantine princess, like courtly etiquette and the Bible, but preferred classical myth and philosophy. To access this material, she had to learn to read and speak Ancient Greek, by studying secretly at night. Eventually her parents realized how serious she was, and provided her with tutors. Anna expanded her studies to classical literature, rhetoric, history, philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine. One scholar even complained that her constant requests for more Aristotle commentaries were wearing out his eyes. At age fifteen, Anna married Nikephoros Bryennios to quell old conflicts between their families and strengthen Alexios’s reign. Fortunately, Anna and Nikephoros ended up sharing many intellectual interests, hosting and debating the leading scholars of the day. Meanwhile, Alexios’s military excursions began to pay off, restoring many of the empire’s former territories. As her father aged, Anna and her husband helped her parents with their imperial duties. During this time, Anna reportedly advocated for just treatment of the people in their disputes with the government. After Alexios’s death, Anna’s brother John ascended to the throne and Anna turned back to philosophy and scholarship. Her husband had written a history arguing that his grandfather would have made a better emperor than Alexios, but Anna disagreed. She began working on the Alexiad, which made the case for her father's merits as emperor. Spanning the late 11th and early 12th centuries of Byzantine history, the Alexiad recounts the tumultuous events of Alexios’s reign, and Anna’s own reactions to those events, like bursting into tears at the thought of the deaths of her parents and husband. She may have included these emotional passages in hopes that they would make her writing more palatable to a society that believed women shouldn't write about battles and empires. While her loyalty to her father was evident in her favorable account of his reign, she also included criticism and her opinions of events. In the centuries after her death, Anna’s Alexiad was copied over and over, and remains an invaluable eyewitness account of Alexios’s reign today. And through her epic historical narrative, Anna Komnene secured her own place in history. "
457,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,juO4zxsjSjw,"Will winning the lottery make you happier? Imagine winning a multi-million dollar lottery tomorrow. If you're like many of us, you'd be ecstatic, unable to believe your good luck. But would that joy still be there a few years later? Maybe not. A famous study of 22 lottery winners showed that months after winning, their average reported levels of happiness had increased no more than that of a control group  who hadn't won the lottery. Some were actually unhappier than they had been before winning. And later studies have confirmed that our emotional well-being, how often and how intensely  we feel things like joy, sorrow, anxiety, or anger, don't seem to improve with wealth or status beyond a certain point. This has to do with a phenomenon known as hedonic adaptation, or the hedonic treadmill. It describes our tendency to adapt to new situations to maintain a stable  emotional equilibrium. When it comes to feeling happy, most of us seem to have a base level that stays more or less constant throughout our existence. Of course, the novelty of better food, superior vacations, and more beautiful homes can at first make you feel like you're walking on air, but as you get used to those things, you revert to your default emotional state. That might sound pretty gloomy, but hedonic adaptation makes us  less emotionally sensitive to any kind of change, including negative ones. The study with the lottery winners also looked at people who had suffered an accident that left them paralyzed. When asked several months after their accidents how happy they were, they reported levels of happiness approaching their original baseline. So while the hedonic treadmill may inhibit our enjoyment of positive changes, it seems to also enable our resilience in recovering from adversity. There are other reasons  that winning the lottery may not make us happier in the long run. It can be difficult to manage large sums of money, and some lottery winners wind up spending or losing it all quickly. It can also be socially isolating. Some winners experience a deluge of unwelcome requests for money, so they wind up cutting themselves off from others. And wealth may actually make us meaner. In one study, participants played a rigged game of monopoly where the experimenters made some players rich quickly. The wealthy players started patronizing the poorer players and hogging the snacks  they were meant to share. But just because a huge influx of cash isn't guaranteed to bring joy into your life doesn't mean that money  can never make us happier. Findings show that we adapt to extrinsic and material things, like a new car or a bigger house, much faster than we do  to novel experiences, like visiting a new place or learning a new skill. So by that reasoning, the more you spend money on experiences rather than things, the happier you'd be. And there's another way to turn your money into happiness: spend it on other people. In one study, participants were given some money and were either asked to spend it on themselves or on someone else. Later that evening, researchers called up these participants and asked them how happy they were. The happiness levels of those who had spent the money on others were significantly greater than that of those who had spent it on themselves. And that seems to be true around the world. Another study examined the generosity of over 200,000 people from 136 countries. In over 90% of these countries, people who donated tended to be happier than those who didn't. But this may all be easier said than done. Let's say a million dollars falls into your lap tomorrow. What do you do with it? "
458,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,jvWncVbXfJ0,"2,300 years ago, the rulers of Alexandria  set out to fulfill one of humanity’s most audacious goals: to collect all the knowledge in the world  under one roof. In its prime, the Library of Alexandria housed  an unprecedented number of scrolls and attracted some of  the Greek world’s greatest minds. But by the end of the 5th century CE, the great library had vanished. Many believed it was destroyed  in a catastrophic fire. The truth of the library’s rise  and fall is much more complex. The idea for the library came  from Alexander the Great. After establishing himself as a conqueror, the former student of Aristotle turned his attention to building an empire of knowledge headquartered in his namesake city. He died before construction began, but his successor, Ptolemy I, executed Alexander’s plans for a museum and library. Located in the royal district of the city, the Library of Alexandria may have been built  with grand Hellenistic columns, native Egyptian influences, or a unique blend of the two--there are no surviving accounts of its architecture. We do know it had lecture halls, classrooms, and, of course, shelves. As soon as the building was complete, Ptolemy I began to fill it with primarily Greek and Egyptian scrolls. He invited scholars to live  and study in Alexandria at his expense. The library grew as they contributed  their own manuscripts, but the rulers of Alexandria still wanted  a copy of every book in the world. Luckily, Alexandria was a hub for ships traveling through the Mediterranean. Ptolemy III instituted a policy requiring  any ship that docked in Alexandria to turn over its books for copying. Once the Library’s scribes had duplicated the texts, they kept the originals and sent the copies back to the ships. Hired book hunters also scoured the Mediterranean in search of new texts, and the rulers of Alexandria attempted  to quash rivals by ending all exports of the Egyptian  papyrus used to make scrolls. These efforts brought hundreds  of thousands of books to Alexandria. As the library grew, it became possible to find information on more subjects than ever before, but also much more difficult to find information on any specific subject. Luckily, a scholar named Callimachus of Cyrene set to work on a solution, creating the pinakes, a 120-volume catalog of the library’s contents, the first of its kind. Using the pinakes, others were able to navigate  the Library’s swelling collection. They made some astounding discoveries. 1,600 years before Columbus set sail, Eratosthenes not only realized  the earth was round, but calculated its circumference  and diameter within a few miles of their actual size. Heron of Alexandria created the world’s first steam engine over a thousand years before it was finally reinvented during  the Industrial Revolution. For about 300 years after its founding  in 283 BCE, the library thrived. But then, in 48 BCE, Julius Caesar  laid siege to Alexandria and set the ships in the harbor on fire. For years, scholars believed the library burned as the blaze spread into the city. It's possible the fire destroyed part of the sprawling collection, but we know from ancient writings that scholars continued to visit  the library for centuries after the siege. Ultimately, the library slowly disappeared as the city changed from Greek, to Roman, Christian, and eventually Muslim hands. Each new set of rulers viewed its contents as a threat rather than a source of pride. In 415 CE, the Christian rulers even had  a mathematician named Hypatia murdered for studying  the library’s ancient Greek texts, which they viewed as blasphemous. Though the Library of Alexandria and its countless texts are long gone, we’re still grappling with the best ways to collect, access, and preserve our knowledge. There’s more information available today and more advanced technology to preserve it, though we can’t know for sure that our digital archives will be more resistant to destruction than Alexandria’s ink and paper scrolls. And even if our reservoirs of knowledge  are physically secure, they will still have to resist  the more insidious forces that tore the library apart: fear of knowledge, and the arrogant belief that the past is obsolete. The difference is that, this time, we know what to prepare for. "
459,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,kF54-camgCg,"In 1956, architect Frank Lloyd Wright proposed a mile-high skyscraper. It was going to be the world’s  tallest building, by a lot — five times as high as the Eiffel Tower. But many critics laughed at the architect, arguing that people would have to wait  hours for an elevator, or worse, that the tower would collapse  under its own weight. Most engineers agreed, and despite the publicity  around the proposal, the titanic tower was never built. But today, bigger and bigger buildings are going up  around the world. Firms are even planning skyscrapers  more than a kilometer tall, like the Jeddah Tower in Saudi Arabia, three times the size of the Eiffel Tower. Very soon, Wright’s mile-high miracle  may be a reality. So what exactly was stopping us from building these megastructures 70 years ago, and how do we build something  a mile high today? In any construction project, each story of the structure needs to be able to support the stories on top of it. The higher we build, the higher the gravitational pressure  from the upper stories on the lower ones. This principle has long dictated  the shape of our buildings, leading ancient architects to favor  pyramids with wide foundations that support lighter upper levels. But this solution doesn’t quite translate to a city skyline– a pyramid that tall would be roughly one-and-a-half miles wide, tough to squeeze into a city center. Fortunately, strong materials like  concrete can avoid this impractical shape. And modern concrete blends are reinforced  with steel-fibers for strength and water-reducing polymers  to prevent cracking. The concrete in the world’s tallest tower, Dubai’s Burj Khalifa, can withstand about 8,000 tons of pressure per square meter– the weight of over 1,200  African elephants! Of course, even if a building supports itself, it still needs support from the ground. Without a foundation, buildings this heavy would sink, fall,  or lean over. To prevent the roughly half a million  ton tower from sinking, 192 concrete and steel supports called  piles were buried over 50 meters deep. The friction between the piles  and the ground keeps this sizable structure standing. Besides defeating gravity, which pushes the building down, a skyscraper also needs to overcome the blowing wind, which pushes from the side. On average days, wind can exert up to 17 pounds of force per square meter on a high-rise building– as heavy as a gust of bowling balls. Designing structures to be aerodynamic, like China’s sleek Shanghai Tower, can reduce that force by up to a quarter. And wind-bearing frames inside or outside the building can absorb the remaining wind force, such as in Seoul’s Lotte Tower. But even after all these measures, you could still find yourself swaying back and forth more than a meter on top floors  during a hurricane. To prevent the wind from rocking tower tops, many skyscrapers employ a counterweight weighing hundreds of tons called a “tuned mass damper.” The Taipei 101, for instance, has suspended a giant metal orb above the 87th floor. When wind moves the building, this orb sways into action, absorbing the building’s kinetic energy. As its movements trail the tower’s, hydraulic cylinders between the ball  and the building convert that kinetic energy into heat, and stabilize the swaying structure. With all these technologies in place, our mega-structures can stay standing and stable. But quickly traveling through buildings this large is a challenge in itself. In Wright’s age, the fastest elevators moved  a mere 22 kilometers per hour. Thankfully, today’s elevators are much faster, traveling over 70 km per hour with future cabins potentially using  frictionless magnetic rails for even higher speeds. And traffic management algorithms group riders by destination to get passengers and empty cabins where they need to be. Skyscrapers have come a long way since Wright proposed his mile-high tower. What were once considered impossible ideas have become architectural opportunities. Today it may just be a matter of time until one building goes the extra mile. "
460,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,kfDvdYj0_fA,"When trains began to shuttle people  across the coutryside, many insisted they would never replace horses. Less than a century later, people repeated that same prediction about cars, telephones, radio, television, and computers. Each had their own host of detractors. Even some experts insisted they wouldn’t catch on. Of course, we can’t predict exactly what the future will look like or what new inventions will populate it. But time and time again, we’ve also failed to predict that the technologies of the present will change the future. And recent research has revealed  a similar pattern in our individual lives: we’re unable to predict change  in ourselves. Three psychologists documented our inability to predict personal change in a 2013 paper called, “The End of History Illusion.” Named after political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s prediction that liberal democracy was the final form of government, or as he called it, “the end of history,” their work highlights the way  we see ourselves as finished products at any given moment. The researchers recruited over 7,000 participants ages 18 to 68. They asked half of these participants to report their current personality traits, values, and preferences, along with what each of those metrics  had been ten years before. The other half described those features  in their present selves, and predicted what  they would be ten years in the future. Based on these answers, the researchers then calculated  the degree of change each participant reported or predicted. For every age group in the sample, they compared the predicted changes  to the reported changes. So they compared the degree to which  18-year-olds thought they would change to the degree to which 28-year-olds  reported they had changed. Overwhelmingly, at all ages, people’s future estimates of change  came up short compared to the changes  their older counterparts recalled. 20-year-olds expected  to still like the same foods at 30, but 30-year-olds no longer  had the same tastes. 30-year-olds predicted they’d still  have the same best friend at 40, but 40-year-olds  had lost touch with theirs. And 40-year-olds predicted they’d maintain the same core values that 50-year-olds had reconsidered. While older people changed less  than younger people on the whole, they underestimated  their capacity for change just as much. Wherever we are in life, the end of history illusion persists: we tend to think that the bulk  of our personal change is behind us. One consequence of this thinking is that we’re inclined to overinvest in future choices based on present preferences. On average, people are willing to pay about 60% more to see their current favorite musician ten years in the future than they’d currently pay to see their favorite musician from ten years ago. While the stakes involved in concert-going are low, we’re susceptible  to similar miscalculations in more serious commitments, like homes, partners, and jobs. At the same time, there’s no real way to predict what our preferences  will be in the future. Without the end of history Illusion, it would be difficult to make any long-term plans. So the end of history illusion applies to our individual lives, but what about the wider world? Could we be assuming that how things  are now is how they will continue to be? If so, fortunately, there are countless records to remind us that the world does change, sometimes for the better. Our own historical moment  isn’t the end of history, and that can be just as much a source of comfort as a cause for concern. "

Today, we'll see what happens when power changes hands and Justininian becomes sole ruler of Rome. Turns out, a lot happens. Upon coming into his own, Justinian bursts into a flurry of action, nearly unparalleled in history. He reformed almost every aspect of the empire, trying to fix a thousand years of bureaucracy and neglect. But he didn't do it alone. He elevated a cast of some of the most talented, most diligent men in the history of the empire to attack all the things he saw wrong with the imperium. Unfortunately, these brilliant hardworking servants of the empire were also some of the most corrupt, quirky, and colorful characters the empire would ever see. So today, we're just going to work through Justinian's reforms by introducing you to these characters and what they did. First off, Justinian was a big spender. He wanted to build up the military, increase infrastructure, create monumental public works, and throw lavish games. But to do all this, he needed coin. And one of the problems the Roman Empire struggled with from its inception one of the problems that helped bring down the west and had almost brought down the east was tax collection. The rich would avoid their taxes and the poor couldn't pay. And this just would not fly for Justinian. So he brought in John the Cappadocian. I mean, he even sounds like a mobster, doesn't he? This guy, John the Cappadocian, totally overhauled the tax system in the empire. He moved tax collection out of the hands of local officials He crushed corruption within the ranks of the tax collectors and one of his less popular reforms, at least with some segments of society, was torturing rich people until they paid their taxes. Of course, he was also a debauched glutton who skimmed from the taxes to feed his own perversions. Reports abound of his greed his sexual appetites, and his boorish slave-like treatment of his staff. Now, of course, many of these are exaggerations. After all, nobody likes the tax man. And being a more efficient tax collector probably isn't gonna win you a glorious place in contemporary history. But, there are enough of these reports that I think we can assume this guy was likely running a very whistle-clean tax administration while shaking people down and engaging in some Baron Harkonnen-like good times himself. With the money he needed taken well care of, Justinian also attacked the second problem of the empire: the legal code. For a thousand years, laws had been added, changed, and overturned without anyone really collating them, rationalizing them, or really putting them together in any way that wasn't contradictory. At this point a lot of them just plain didn't make sense. This meant that the law courts had become clogged, corruption was rampant and justice through the legal system was simply not available for most people. Justinian planned to end this, and so he brought in Tribonian. Tribonian was one of the most brilliant legal minds of all time. In 14 months, he untangled a millenium of roman law and had a new law code ready to publish. Then, he compressed fifteen hundred existing books of legal decisions down to a mere 50-book set making the law comprehensible and approachable. With Justinian's help, he then had these books ruled to supersede all previous legal decisions so that all lawyers and judges were working from the same law. He rounded out these mind-boggling feats by writing an accessible textbook for all future lawyers to learn from and together, these books formed the Corpus Juris Civilis the work that today's civil law is founded on. Of course, Tribonian was also an unabashed pagan, throwing sacrilegious parties and feasts even as Justinian was ostensibly cracking down on paganism. He was also utterly corrupt, or as one author once put it, every day he repealed or enacted some law at the insistance of people who purchased this from him. Otherwise, of course, he was known for being good-natured, diplomatic, and only a little bit of a fop. With the Herculean task of reforming the entire canon of Roman law safely in the hands of perhaps the only man in history who might actually be up to the challenge Justinian could finally turn his eye on military affairs. Justinian dreamed of reconquering the west, of reuniting and recreating an empire that had only fallen some fifty years before. He dreamed of restoring Rome. But at the time the Romans were being kicked around by the Sassanid Persians all across the southern half of the empire. Before Justinian could turn his eye west, he had to stop the Persians from taking over what empire there was left. And for this, he had one of the best generals history has ever produced: a man easiliy the rival of Napoleon or Alexander, though his name's not so well known. A man named Belisarius. From an early age, Justinian recognized this man's brilliance and by the time Belisarius was 25 he was Magister Militum, or theater commander of the east. But to talk about Belisarius, we have to talk about the battle of Dara. At this point, Roman armies had suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of the Persians. The situation looked hopeless. Belisarius had been ordered to gather together whatever troops he can and hold the town of Dara a small fortress town that guarded the entrance to Anatolia. If the Sassanid army got past there, they'd be in the heart of the empire. Envoys were sent from the imperial court to sue for peace, but the Persian king would have none of it. His army moved toward Dara. Reports start coming in of the strength of the Persian army. 30, 40, no 50 000 men. Fifty thousand. Belisarius looked to his troops standing on the walls of his desert border fort. 25 000 men. Huh. Belisarius wanted to hole up, to fight from behind these walls. It was the only way they'd have a chance against an army twice their size But he knew that if he did that, the Persians would just go around him. Behind him was nothing but farmers in their fields and priests in their churches No, he had to stop them here. So he prepared to fight. A messenger galloped up from the Persians and handed him a note. It was from the enemy commander. It said, prepare me a bath, for tomorrow I shall bathe in this fortress. Belisarius ordered his men to dig. The next day, the armies lined up for battle. The massive Persian army with their infantry in the center and the famed Immortals on the wings. The Byzantine army lined up across from it, with their infantry anchoring the center behind a great trench they had dug on Belisarius's command with heavy cavalry on the wings, lighter cavalry in reserve, and a small force of Huns hidden behind a hill. The Persian cavalry charged. The wings were a whirling melee of horses and men. But the center, the infantry holding the Byzantine center, just stood there behind their trench. The Persian commander faltered. Even with his numbers, he didn't want to charge his infantry over that trench. His cavalry were doing well, he would let them win the day. Once they'd routed the Roman cavalry, they could circle behind the infantry and negate Belisarius's improvised defense. And like that, the Persians pinned their own infantry, giving up their massive advantage in numbers. Then, just as the cavalry melee was swinging toward the Persians, the Huns sprang from their hiding place. All of a sudden, the Persians' right flank was in disarray. They were falling back. But no matter, there was still time to rally them. The left flank was still doing well. They pushed the Romans beyond the trench line. They were pursuing the Roman cavalry almost to the walls of Dara itself. But the rest of the Persian army was still where it had begun. There was a huge gap between the Immortals, who had chased the Byzantine cataphract, and the infantry that had never moved. The Persian cavalry had chased the Byzantines so far that they were now behind enemy lines. And their infantry was way too far away to support them. The Roman cavalry reserve charged. The main Byzantine cavalry rallied. The Immortals were surrounded, cut off. Discipline fell apart. Each man tried to hew his way out, but one by one they fell. And now the Byzantines, having the only cavalry left on the field, knew it was their turn to ride the Persians down. No Sassanid commander would be bathing in Dara that day. This victory paved the way for peace in the east. The empire would still have to pay dearly for it, 11 000 pounds of gold, but now the southeastern border could be secured, and Justinian could turn to the west. Now, following our pattern, this is where you might expect me to tell you of Belisarius's flaws, but by all accounts he was a stand-up guy. So instead, I'm gonna tell you about a historian who was Belisarius's legal advisor and came on all of his campaigns: a fellow named Procopius. Procopius is our principle source for Justinian's reign. By being with Belisarius, he had a front row seat to almost every major event. His work is thorough and comprehensive. It's a historian's dream. Thanks to him, the reign of Justinian is perhaps one of the best-documented periods in Byzantine history. But, and here's where it gets wild, in the 1600s, in an archive in the Vatican library, there was found a book. A hidden secret book, called the Secret History. Also by Procopius. And while Procopius's official histories paint the reign of Justinian as glorious with a handful of failings mixed in his secret history talks of Justinian as a monster. And I don't mean like a figurative monster, I mean a demonic creature that could pop off its head and wander the palace headless late at night. It depicts Theodora as debauched and depraved, and spares no one in Justinian's inner circle Now, today, most historians see Procopius's principle histories as highly valuable and regard the secret history as little more than slander from some noble who was angered by the way Justinian eroded the power of the nobility. But where else will you find a secret history, hidden away for centuries, penned by the same guy who served as the glowing chronicler of the reign, filled with demons and monsters and the most slanderous critique? Nothing in the reign of Justinian and Theodora was done small. Sorry we didn't quite get to talking about the Demes like I promised last time, but there's just so much going on within the first few years of Justinian's reign. Don't you worry though, next time, haha, next time, prepare to witness the Demes' full fury in the Nico revolt [outro music] "
463,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,kpFmzkxd-HI,"Tiberius drove government to standstill and broke all bounds of Roman tradition, deposing a tribune so that he might get his way but even as he pushed his reforms through with the people, other sentiments were brewing. Tiberius secured the vacated position of tribune for one of his clients and began the survey of roman public lands to enact his law. But once all was calm, the dismissal of the tribune Octavius sat well with no one. Even some of the public who had supported Tiberius looked with shame on how they'd let their republic be controlled by fickle whims. So he looked to shore up his support with the public when the perfect opportunity fell into his hands. The king of Pergamon died and in his will, he left his kingdom to Rome. This may sound schocking but he had no heir and he didn't want his people to face a civil war or eventually a war with Rome. He could better safeguard them by ensuring their good treatment in his will than by facing Rome on the battlefield Tiberius seized on this and said that the wealth of the king should be used to give poor farmers the tools they needed to get their farms started. And while the senate was debating on how to administer the cities of the realm Tiberius declared that this was not a matter for them to discuss and that he himself would personally submit a proposal to the people. The senate was incensed. Foreign affairs had always been the purview of the senate. Now, even those senators who had previously stayed on the sideline got involved. On the floor of the senate, senator after senator began to give speeches berating Tiberius for acting like a king. One of these speeches stung so deep that Tiberius ran out of the senate house, gathered the people and ordered that the senator who spoke be brought before them so Tiberius could denounce him. But the senator simply said to the people: 'If thou wish to heap insult upon me and degrade me and I Invoke the aid of one thy colleagues in office and he mount the rostra to speak in my defence and thou fly into a passion, come, wilt thou deprive that colleague of his office?' This was a sarcastic reference to the removal of Octavian. And seeing the effect this had on the people Tiberius simply dismissed the assembly and let the senator go. But now fearing for his life and needing the sacrosanctity that came with being a tribune, Tiberius ran for tribune again. And I should mention that in 200 years no man had ever served as tribune twice in a row. He started making all sorts of promises to the people about what he would do as tribune, not all of which might be seen as in the best interests of Rome. But even this was not enough. On the day of the vote, Tiberius was clearly falling behind. His friends stood up and made speeches and hurled insults at the other candidate, in an attempt to slow things down, managing to stall just long enough that the voting had to be closed for the day They would be back the next day and they would be rallying many more of their supporters to bring to the forum. At dawn against many ill omens, Tiberius went to the forum for the election. A great crowd was gathered but the voting couldn't be started. A disturbance on the periphery of the crowd kept interrupting the proceedings as the vote was being called to order. Then, a senator standing in the crowd motioned to Tiberius that he wished to speak. Tiberius waved to the crowd to let him through. The senator came forward with a warning: He stated that a faction of wealthy Romans planned to have Tiberius assassinated. The men close enough to hear this armed themselves with clubs and prepared for violence. Those a little further off, confused over this commotion, tried to ask what was going on but the tumult of the crowd was too great. So Tiberius rose up and pointed to his head to indicate that his life was in danger but this wasn't exactly a clear signal. At the border of the crow, one man saw this and immediately ran to the senate to tell them that Tiberius was asking for a crown. The senate, shocked at this called upon the consul to act, but the consul merely replied that 'Hey, if the people voted for anything unlawful he would nullify the vote. Chill out!' This was not a satisfactory answer for one of the senators though, who lept to his feet with the words: 'Since, then, the chief magistrate betrays the state, do ye who wish to succour the laws follow me?' And with many like-minded senators and their attendance in tow he marched toward the forum, grabbing clubs and staves and even the legs of benches to enact what they saw as the law. They lay into the crowd with their cudgels and the panic began. Tiberius's men tried to fight back, but in the whirling melee and the trampling throng Tiberius fell as he tried to escape and his assailants fell upon him. One beat him with the leg of a bench another with a stone until at last... he and 300 others lay dead in the forum. After this came the retributions: more of Tiberius's followers were executed or exiled. The bodies of those who had defended him were tossed into the Tiber and when Gaius asked for his brother's body he was denied, for even Tiberius had been thrown into that river for which he was named. It was the first great act of political violence in the Roman republic and it would set the tone for the next 100 years. In Roman law a tribune was ""sacrosanct"" which meant that it wasn't just a crime but a sacrilege to harm them. It was the highest taboo and the stabilizing factor that kept the Roman republic from descending into a rule of the strong. But now that taboo was shattered. And once a collective taboo is broken there is no going back, Violence had now been introduced into political life, and no democracy can survive the weight of violence. But our story doesn't end here Tiberius was known to be of a calm and rational disposition, but he wasn't the only Gracchi brother. Join us next time as Gaius takes up his cause. "
464,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,lFfHp83Xm04,"Afghanistan... Graveyard of empires... Where Alexander met his match. Where the great Soviets would stumble. But right now, September 1897, the British empire takes its turn, playing out their own tragedy in the heat and the dust. Eventually, they too will leave enervated, sacked of strength by this unforgiving land. But not today! *Intro music* In 1857, a great uprising had swept through India and nearly displaced the British forces there. Since then, British continuously fought smaller rebellions to hold on to the jewel of their empire. Today, it's September twelfth, eighteen nineteen ninety-seven. Dawn comes to the very boundary of empire. We stand in the uncontrolled borderland, that would today be just on the Pakistani side of the Pakistan/Afghanistan divide. The British Empire has been trying to consolidate its hold on this wild, untamed region for some time. They've built a strain of forts to help them project their power into the mountain's tribeland. In this string of forts, there are two, name Fort Gullistan and Fort Lockhart, and between these two stands a tiny threadbare village called Saragarhi. It is this village that concerns us today because in that village, the British had established a signaling post so that Fort Gullistan and Fort Lockhart could communicate with each other. And they had manned that post with a handful of Sikhs. Dawn breaks. The men wash, go through their morning meditations, affix their turbans, and begin their day. Over the last 10 days, there have been probing attacks on the forts. There's a sense that something is brewing, and everybody is on high alert. The Sikhs man their posts and begin their morning tasks. The air is dry, thin in the mountain passes. The day is clear. Someone tells a joke to break the tension, and everybody laughs, but the feeling remains. One of the lookouts shouts; there's a great mass moving on the horizon. All 21 men on this tiny post take up defensive stations. The signal man operates a tiny hand-cranked mirror that lets him send signals to the forts by making Morse code out of flashes of light. He signals Fort Lockhart to let them know the situation. Fort Lockhart signals back that they count at least 14 standards, at least 10,000 tribesmen, once allied with the British, but now in full revolt. And they are descending on the fort, with only the little signaling post standing in their way. All around the signal man, the others are gathering ammunition and barring up the gates of the tiny compound. The signal man sends a fateful message: ""Can you send help?"" There's a moment delay, then a reply. ""No. They won't get there in time, and they can't leave the fort unguarded."" The men in the signaling unit gather around their commander, Havildar Ishar Singh, knowing that they could still make a break for it, but Ishar calmly tells them what they are, in their hearts, already prepared for. They will stay, and they will fight. They will delay the oncoming tribesmen as long as possible. They will buy the forts the time they need to call in reinforcements. There is no disagreement, no mutiny, no desertion. There is only a quiet acknowledgement as the men get back to work. The signalman returns to his mirror. Throughout the day, he will never stop relaying the events. The sound of the onrushing horde grows louder. Rifles crack, then the horde is upon them, assaulting the outer wall. The disciplined fire of the Sikh troops break the first wave of the tribesmen, but they're like the sea: rolling back, reforming, then rushing back with even greater strength. Bodies drop all along the field in front of the signaling post. Twenty rifles roaring against ten thousand. But this time, it's not enough to break the charge. Shells pepper the rough hune walls. One of the signal company falls dead. Then the enemy is at the wall, climbing, clambering up, determined. A brief melee: knives and swords, bayonets and rifle butts. They break the wave again, but this time there's Sikh blood in the dust, under the baking sun. The bodies of the fallen are carried back into the inner wall. Each loss is a friend, one of only 21 holding this station. And that number is dropping. Shouts are heard from outside the wall. The tribes' leaders are promising the Sikhs wealth, safety, and positions of importance if they just abandon their post. No man budges. The sun falls low on the horizon, turned a smear of blood-scarlet by the smoke. The attackers have set fire to the low brush that clings to the hills surrounding the fort. The Sikhs look out, trying to see the shape of their foes through the thick gray smoke. Then the signal man shouts. The neighboring fort has flashed a dire warning. From their position on the hill, the fort spotted a handful of tribesmen coming out of the smoke to a blind approach on the side of the signaling station. They've breached  the first wall. Ishar Singh  barks orders, raking off a handful of men  to defend the breach. When shouts sound from the flanking attack, the main force rushes the main gate again, now with their diminished numbers. Soon, all combat deteriorates into a desperate melee with bayonet, knife, boot, and sword. Tribesmen after tribesmen fall to the Sikh's  cold steel, but the weight of numbers takes its toll. Inch by inch,  the Sikhs are pushed back. Each soldier of the signal post  sells his life dearly, slaying dozens for each defender that falls. But soon there are only a handful of the signal troop left. Ishar Singh orders  his men to fall back, to retreat to the comparative safety  of the inner wall and mount a defense. But they can't break  and get through the gate without giving their attackers an opening to force their way through. Ishar knows this. He tells his men to go, then bellows, charging the swarming tribesmen with sword and pistol in hand. For a few valiant seconds, he cuts down attacker after attacker, and then  is overwhelmed. His blood stains the rock, but, it is enough. His men have taken  to the inner wall and formed a second  defensive position. He knew, and they know, that the position is still hopeless, but it'll buy  the forts more time, and cost their assailants more dearly. Fewer than a dozen men  stand to return fire. Every shot fired into the  swirling mass before them is almost certainly fatal, but axes and clubs and rifle butts hammer  against the thin wooden wall. It's not long before  the gates come crashing down. The signal man sends out one final message, requesting permission  to take up his rifle. When the fort grants it, he packs up his signal gear  back into its leather case and affixes his bayonet to his rifle. The men from the fort can only watch as the signal man moves to hold the door of his small signal shed. He is the last Sikh  alive in the fort. For a moment, they cheer as he fells one tribesmen, then another. And then,  eighteen more. The tribesmen  pull back, and for a moment,  the troops are hopeful, but then  they see the smoke. The assailants have lit  the signal station on fire. Later, it will be reported that the signal man yells the Sikh battle cry over and over as the fire burned, ""Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal,"" or ""Shout Aloud  in Ecstasy! True is  the Great Timeless One."" The signal post  is taken, but 21 Sikh's stand brought their neighboring forts the time they needed. By the time the rebelling tribesmen attack, the forts  have been reinforced, and they succeed  in turning back the tide. When at last the British take back the tiny signaling post in the tiny mountain village of Saragarhi, they found that  the 21 men signaling unit had left behind hundreds of casualties. The Battle of Saragarhi is the only time in British military history where every single soldier involved in a military action was awarded the highest military award available to them. You can argue how much impact their sacrifice had, of course. The British would lose influence in Afghanistan in less than 25 years and would lose control of India one month before the 50th anniversary of this battle. But this group reminds of all groups that have sacrificed to make great nations great, the groups we often forget when we talk about the movements of great powers on the world stage. And that alone is something worth mentioning, even 120 years later. [Outro theme] "
465,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,lY8c8jDPSgE,"It's 1794. For the last four years, Kamehameha has been building his great fleet and amassing muskets through trade with western ships. With his power ascendant, he now faces not just the king of Maui, but an alliance of all the other islands. ♪♪ Actraiser OST - Birth of The People (Arrangement) ♪♪ Already this alliance has tried to depose him with an invasion, but he met their fleet of cannon-armed war canoes with his own, defeating them in a fierce naval engagement off the coast northwest of Hawai'i. Finally, the moment arrived. Two western merchant men brought him vital intelligence. The old King of Maui was dead. His son, Kalanikūpule, now ruled from O'ahu. This was the same man that Kamehameha had defeated in his first attempt to conquer Maui, and now his position was even less secure. His forces were reduced from warring with his relatives, and he feared Kamehameha's naval power so much, that he boarded the two western vessels and tried unsuccessfully to impress them into his own fleet. The time was right. Kamehameha made for Maui and Moloka'i, securing both islands in a series of brutal amphibious assaults before moving on to the enemy's base on O'ahu. Six hundred war canoes bore down on O'ahu's south shore, their sails rigged in the western style that could travel upwind. Under the guns of two western ships, one built with British aid, Kamehameha lands 16,000 Hawaiian warriors, and his troops sweep through O'ahu, forcing Kalanikūpule's men out of their fortified temples. The allied army broke, fleeing to make a last stand with a thousand-foot cliff at their backs. Kamehameha's warriors formed ranks and drove them over the side. With the conquest of O'ahu complete, Kamehameha now ruled all the Islands apart from Kaua'i and Ni'ihau. Before moving on, he needs to secure his power base. Within months, he would capture and sacrifice Kalanikūpule and crush a small rebellion back on Hawai'i. Kamehameha hunted his enemies, and he particularly wanted to find two men. A decade before, he had attacked a party of unarmed fishermen, but gotten his foot stuck in a rock fissure. The fishermen, seeing him helpless, had knocked Kamehameha senseless with a canoe paddle. Then they had fled, leaving him concussed next to the broken oar. These two men were soon found. To merely touch an ali'i meant death. So, when they entered the King's presence, they were resigned to execution. But, to their shock, Kamehameha apologized to them. He had wronged them by attacking without cause, and they had been right to defend themselves. Indeed he would declare a new law: The Law of the Splintered Paddle, stating that all people young and old should lie by the roadside in safety without fear of armies or brigands. Violate this.... and die! This edict is considered one of the oldest human rights laws, and it's still enshrined in the Hawai'i State Constitution, but it also declared an end to the days of raids and warfare. Kamehameha wanted a stable system, after all, not one riven by conflict. His first priority was reform. Years of war had ravaged Hawaiian agriculture, With farmers leaving their taro fields fallow, or failing to repair fish ponds. Kamehameha toured O'ahu, personally working fields to set an example and drafting the populace to repair public works. He also reformed Hawai'i's system of land division, making the parcels less self-sufficient so that the ruling ali'i couldn't build a power base to oppose him. The new system also granted use of the land, rather than ownership. Kamehameha could strip rights to the land away should a chief displease him. Strangely, Kamehameha's reforms always seemed to grant more power to Kamehameha. In order to administer this new empire, Kamehameha hand picked men from his inner circle and installed them as governors of each island. He also established a flourishing court, which showed his greatness and legitimacy. He rewarded loyal chiefs, and kept rival ali'i under his eye. He wanted no more rebellions. But Kamehameha also discovered something that he liked more than war: trade. Kamehameha's interest in commerce had taken root well before his invasion of O'ahu, and he had obtained most of his weapons by trading with western ships. Shortly before the invasion, Kamehameha had hosted the British explorer George Vancouver, setting him up as Great Britain's semi-official partner in the region. For his part, Kamehameha had sought protection from the Royal Navy, hoping that the British would lend military aid and protect them if other nations invaded. But Vancouver had misinterpreted this as Kamehameha ceding the islands to the UK. Neither prospect really went anywhere, but it started Hawai'i's first diplomatic and trading relationship, and Kamehameha had a commodity that foreigners desired: sandalwood, prized in China for making boxes and incense. Since Hawai'i had become a stop on the China route, selling sandalwood made sense. Trade boomed, to the point that Kamehameha had to place a kapu, or sacred prohibition, on young sandalwood trees to make sure that wood poachers didn't drive them extinct. Sandalwood made Hawai'i a major trade center. Traffic at Honolulu Harbor exploded. Once just a moderately-sized village, the burgeoning town of Honolulu soon had 200 houses and a thriving dock yard. Hawaiian authorities collected docking and harbor pilot fees and encouraged locals to start warehouses and repair facilities to serve the western ships. Kamehameha specifically courted these western traders. He met ship captains while dressed in western clothes, and became the first Hawaiian to ride a horse. But this contact with Europe also planted in his head western ideas about monarchy. Kamehameha particularly admired King George III, and exchanged letters and gifts with his government. This contact with Britain would create an enduring legacy - future Hawaiian monarchs would attend parties with Queen Victoria - but this westernization would also separate them from both their traditions and the Hawaiian populace. Yet, as Kamehameha accepted western ways, he never touched the Hawaiian religion, believing that it held society together. The kapu system, which designated places, people, and things sacred to varying levels of degree, not only told each person their place in the world, but told people where to fish and when, and the proper time to rotate crops. It was repressive, but it kept balance. But outside forces were taking a toll on native life. Farmers abandoned their taro and cut sandalwood. Ali'i exploited the commoners in search of profit. Worst of all, western diseases sent the population into freefall. Measles swept through Kamehameha's army, aborting his second attempt to invade Kaua'i. He himself was laid low with the disease. As he struggled to recover, he felt the weight of mortality, and worried that his great unification would never come to pass. Yet, the king of Kaua'i saw which way the winds were blowing. In 1810, fifteen years after Kamehameha took O'ahu, the two kings met on a neutral ship to finalize a diplomatic arrangement. The king of Kaua'i would declare himself a vassal of Kamehameha, and thereby keep all his rights and privileges. Kamehameha was now the first undisputed ruler of the Kingdom of Hawai'i, a burgeoning maritime state at the heart of the Pacific. But soon, the kingdom faced its first diplomatic crisis: its two largest trading partners, Britain and the United States, were at war. There was a real possibility of Hawaiian ports becoming a war zone. Worse still, Kamehameha was about to launch Hawai'i's first trade expedition to China, and he was afraid that his ship might be mistakenly attacked. Hawai'i needed a flag, something identifiable that declared the island neutral territory and a friend to all. It had a British Union Jack in one corner, and stripes like the U.S. flags, one for each island. The colors would be red, white, and blue, to mirror the flags of British, American, French, and Russian ships that docked in Honolulu Harbor. Despite the overthrow of the kingdom, that same flag flies over Hawai'i to this day. However, opening Hawaii to foreigners meant opening it to foreign interests, and soon the kingdom experienced its first brush with colonial occupation. A mission from the Russian governor of Alaska landed in Honolulu and began building an armed fort, plotting to depose Kamehameha in a coup. He dispatched armed warriors to peacefully but firmly expel the Russians, then took over the fort and armed it for his own use. It turned out that the Russian government hadn't sanctioned this plot, but it taught Kamehameha to keep a tight rein on foreigners who wanted to use Hawaiian soil. He became cautious about who he let use Hawaiian land, and, apart from his favorites, he tried to keep outsiders from amassing too much power. For the last few years of his life, Kamehameha was at the height of his political power. He had a well-drilled army, thriving ports, and no challengers. His favorite wife, Ka'ahumanu, a savvy politician with generals and priests in her pocket, helped him administer the state, but diseases were eating away at his people, and foreign pressures were mounting. 1819. A great king lies dying. To his son Liholiho, he leaves his kingdom and his political power. To his favorite wife and councilor Ka'ahumanu, he gives the role of chief advisor. ""Endless is the good I have given you to enjoy,"" he says, and then dies. His bones are hidden in the mountains in accordance with the old ways. Kamehameha united not just a country, but a people. From this point on, islanders wouldn't say ""I'm from Maui,"" or ""I'm from O'ahu,"" They would say, ""I am Hawaiian."" But the nation that Kamehameha forged with gunpowder would begin to unravel under his heirs. His son Liholiho would become a puppet of the powerful Ka'ahumanu. In an attempt to hold on to power and reform the state, the pair would shatter the already-weakened kapu system, dismantling Kamehameha's beloved temples, and burning the gods.

And when these men of God step ashore, they will set off a chain reaction that will eventually lead to the overthrow of Kamehameha's Kingdom. [End music] "

Where did it come from ? The story is actually pretty great because it involves a particular quirk of early astronomy and mistranslation  and optometry of all things in the 19th century  when we really start to be able to observe Mars through telescopes the telescopes we were looking at with weren't very great and the places we were looking at it from weren't very well situated astronomers would have to wait hours just to get a decent glimpse  of the planet through and its atmosphere, what they didn't realised tho is how much the earth atmosphere was messing with them even if it wasn't visible to the naked eye turbulences in the atmosphere can totally change what we see through a telescope It can smear the image and it's even what causes stars to appear to twinkle then there's albedo the idea that certain parts of the planet reflect light at different degrees on earth for example, a desert or the polarized caps reflect a lot more light the say a forest which can make areas of a planet look darker than another and when you takes those darker spots and smears them out they kinda look like lakes or oasis, then throw into the human teandance to see patterns and stuff related and voilà geological features became a system of canals the idea existed before a uy named Giovanni  Schiaparelli pushed it to the stream he released detailed maps of Mars filled with what he thought seas there was canals on Mars but the italian word for and thus his beautiful maps of the canal were brought into the mainstream there were the great of age of building canals on earth the Suez canal has just been completed and work on the Panama canal began it was the most advanced technology at the time canals were a marvel of engineering so of course an advanced civilization will build canals possibility of an intelligence on Mars Percival Lowell an american entrepreneur adventurer and writer, Japan he traveled extensively this idead of canals on Mars fascinated him and they jibbed with their own observations as an amateur astronomer he decided to dedicate himself to astronomy using his own wealth he built the first observeratory ever intentionally placed away from cities at a high elevation in order to get a better view of worlds beyond their own he stared for hours through his telescope for 15 years he slaved away writing and making detailed observations of what he saw and he saw canals Have you ever looked drirectly into a light for a while and start to seeing some squikling lines those squikling lines you see are actually the veins in your eyeball and Mars is an awfully bright object especially seen through huge telescopes at the end of night so yes was in fact the inside of is own eyeball and drawing his veins in as part of the topographical observations and since the veins in your eyeballs don't tend to move around very much they actually were pretty consistent over his years of observations this led him to declare that Mars is inhabited by beings of some sort of other we may consider as certain as it is he would write a number of books and the civilization that built them his conjecture last desparated attempt of an advanced civilization to get water from the ice caps of their dying planet which might be a little bit familiar to you if you read the opening pages of H.G. Wells' the war of the worlds that exact dying scenario made aliens to invade earth its the emmphasis of the entire book we see this idea again in Edgar Rice Burroughs which stories set in space when it does the reference to talk about its distribution through the canals dying atmosphere through technology and if we jump where did the kids go to school in Heinlein red planet freaking loyal academy shortly after that decay of the Martian civilization still dying still building canals Heinlein even maintains this conception of Mars all the way through Stranger in a strange land just 3 years prior the Mariner 4's launch and why all this ? because it's compelling better stories telling than Mars being a dusty rock and perhaps more importantly cause Mars civization as mirror of ourselves these authors were smart people many of them read in science and many of these writers had to know that they use just bad science to their stories because it was an intriguing idea the science was less important to the questions "

Here's why... This is the library of lost stories. It's where you'll find the true origins of the Sphinx and Stonehenge, the text lost in the fire of Alexandria, all of the great ideas that Einstein never thought to write down, the dream you can't quite remember from last night, your ancestor's first words, her last words. And it's the fastest growing library in the world. In the next year, 25 languages will be added to the collection, never to be heard aloud again, 50 million points of view never related, the last eyewitness account of an incredible act of athleticism, disobedience, courage, unread, unheard, unwatched. But this is the StoryCorps archive at the Library of Congress where everything recorded by StoryCorps is preserved for posterity. This is where, if you record your parents, your grandparents, your neighbors, your children, their stories will live on. What if Anne Frank hadn't kept her diary? What if no one could listen to Martin Luther King's Mountaintop speech? What if the camera hadn't been rolling during the first moon landing? But what if, this Thanksgiving, the youngest member of every family interviewed the oldest? ""It's like the only thing on his mind was to tell the kids that he loved them."" Or if on February 14th, you asked a person you love some questions you've never thought to ask. ""Being married is like having a color television set, you never want to go back  to black and white."" History is all of these things, the testament to tragedy, the progress of civilization, the heroic triumphs, and the moments and stories that are our lives. It's also the act of actively listening to the voices of the past and the people who matter to us. ""Grand Central Station, now, we know there's an architect, but who hung the iron? Who were the brick masons? Who swept the floor? Who kept the trains going? We shall begin celebrating the lives of the uncelebrated."" So you can make history by recording it. "
468,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,mRsa2wb0aTs,"Since the dawn of humanity, an estimated 100.8 billion people have lived and died, a number that increases by about .8% of the world's population each year. What happens to all of those people's bodies after they die and will the planet eventually run out of burial space? When a person's heart stops beating, the body passes through several stages before it begins decomposing. Within minutes after death, the blood begins settling in the lower-most parts of the body. Usually eight to twelve hours later, the skin in those areas is discolored by livor mortis, or post-mortem stain. And while at the moment of death the body's muscles relax completely in a condition called primary flaccidity, they stiffen about two to six hours later in what's known as rigor mortis. This stiffening spreads  through the muscles, and its speed can be affected by age, gender, and the surrounding environment. The body also changes temperature, usually cooling off to match its environment. Next comes decomposition, the process by which bacteria and insects break apart the body. Many factors affect  the rate of decomposition. There is, however, a basic guide of the effect of the environment on decompositon called Casper's Law. It says that if all other  factors are equal, a body exposed to air decomposes twice as fast as one immersed in water and eight times as fast  as one buried in earth. Soil acidity also greatly affects bone preservation. High-acidity soils with  a pH of less than 5.3 will rapidly decompose bone, whereas in a neutral or basic soil with a pH of 7 or more, a skeleton can remain in relatively good condition for centuries. Different cultures throughout history have developed unique approaches to burials. As far back as the first Neanderthal burials, death was accompanied by rituals, like the positioning, coloring, or decorating of corpses. Traditional Christian burials decorate the body in dress, while in traditional Islam, a body is wrapped in a piece  of ritual fabric with the face oriented toward Mecca. Traditional Hindus ceremonially burn the body, and Zoroastrians, followers of one of the oldest monotheistic religions, traditionally place bodies atop a tower to expose them to the Sun and scavenging birds.` Before the Industrial Revolution, burials were simple and accessible. These days, with suitable burial land running out in high-population areas, purchasing private gravesites can be costly, and many people can't afford simple burials. Even cremation, the second most common burial practice in the world, comes with a high cost. As for the question of running out of space, the issue isn't so much about total land in the world as it is that large populations cluster together within cities. Most of the big cities in the world may run out of suitable burial grounds within a century. For London, it's even sooner. That may happen by 2035. So are there alternatives to traditional burials that might help with the space issue? In some countries, skyscraper cemeteries enable vertical burials. Some options focus on the body's relationship with the environment. Promession, for example, freeze-dries and pulverizes the body, creating a powder  that can turn into compost when mixed with oxygen and water. There are also green burials that use special materials, such as biodegradable caskets, urns that sprout trees, and burial suits that grow mushrooms. Eternal reefs take that concept to the depths of the ocean using a mixture of ashes and cement to create marine habitats for sea life. Death is an inevitable part of the human condition, but how we treat bodies and burials continues to evolve. We may each have different spiritual, religious, or practical approaches to dying, but the ever-increasing demand for burial space might give us a push to be creative about where our bodies go after the final stages of life.

But according to the Chinese zodiac, or shēngxiào, it's your shǔxiàng, meaning the animal assigned to your birth year. And of the many myths explaining these animal signs and their arrangement, the most enduring one is that of the Great Race. As the story goes, Yù Dì, or Jade Emperor, Ruler of the Heavens, wanted to devise a way to measure time, so he organized a race. The first twelve animals to make it across the river would earn a spot on the zodiac calendar in the order they arrived. The rat rose with the sun to get an early start, but on the way to the river, he met the horse, the tiger, and the ox. Because the rat was small and couldn't swim very well, he asked the bigger animals for help. While the tiger and horse refused, the kind-hearted ox agreed to carry the rat across. Yet, just as they were about to reach the other side, the rat jumped off the ox's head and secured first place. The ox came in second, with the powerful tiger right behind him. The rabbit, too small to battle the current, nimbly hopped across stones and logs to come in fourth. Next came the dragon, who could have flown directly across, but stopped to help some creatures she had encountered on the way. After her came the horse, galloping across the river. But just as she got across, the snake slithered by. The startled horse reared back, letting the snake sneak into sixth place. The Jade Emperor looked out at the river and spotted the sheep, the monkey, and the rooster all atop a raft, working together to push it  through the weeds. When they made it across, the trio agreed to give eighth place to the sheep, who had been the most comforting and harmonious of them, followed by the monkey and the rooster. Next came the dog, scrambling onto the shore. He was a great swimmer, but frolicked in the water for so long that he only managed to come in eleventh. The final spot was claimed by the pig, who had gotten hungry and stopped to eat and nap before finally waddling  across the finish line. And so, each year is associated with one of the animals in this order, with the cycle starting over every 60 years. Why 60 and not twelve? Well, the traditional Chinese calendar is made up of two overlapping systems. The animals of the zodiac are associated with what's called the Twelve Earthly Branches, or shí'èrzhī. Another system, the Ten Heavenly Stems, or tiāngān, is linked with the five classical elements of metal, xīn, wood, mù, water, shuǐ, fire, huǒ, and earth, tǔ. Each element is assigned yīn or yáng, creating a ten-year cycle. When the twelve animals of the Earthly Branches are matched with the five elements plus the yīn or the yáng of the Heavenly Stems, it creates 60 years  of different combinations, known as a sexagenary cycle, or gānzhī. So someone born in 1980 would have the sign of yáng metal monkey, while someone born in 2007 would be yīn fire pig. In fact, you can also have an inner animal based on your birth month, a true animal based on your birth date, and a secret animal based on  your birth hour. It was the great race that supposedly determined which animals were enshrined  in the Chinese zodiac, but as the system spread through Asia, other cultures made changes to reflect their communities. So if you consult the Vietnamese zodiac, you may discover that you're a cat, not a rabbit, and if you're in Thailand, a mythical snake called a Naga replaces the dragon. So whether or not you place stock  in what the zodiac says about you as an individual, it certainly reveals much about the culture it comes from. "
470,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ml4NSzCQobk,"Physicists, air traffic controllers, and video game creators all have at least one thing in common: vectors. What exactly are they, and why do they matter? To answer, we first need to understand scalars. A scalar is a quantity with magnitude. It tells us how much of something there is. The distance between you and a bench, and the volume and temperature of the beverage in your cup are all described by scalars. Vector quantities also have a magnitude plus an extra piece of information, direction. To navigate to your bench, you need to know how far away it is and in what direction, not just the distance, but the displacement. What makes vectors special and useful in all sorts of fields is that they don't change based on perspective but remain invariant  to the coordinate system. What does that mean? Let's say you and a friend  are moving your tent. You stand on opposite sides so you're facing in opposite directions. Your friend moves two steps to the right and three steps forward while you move two steps to the left and three steps back. But even though it seems  like you're moving differently, you both end up moving  the same distance in the same direction following the same vector. No matter which way you face, or what coordinate system you place over the camp ground, the vector doesn't change. Let's use the familiar  Cartesian coordinate system with its x and y axes. We call these two directions our coordinate basis because they're used to describe  everything we graph. Let's say the tent starts at the origin and ends up over here at point B. The straight arrow connecting the two points is the vector from the origin to B. When your friend thinks about where he has to move, it can be written mathematically as 2x + 3y, or, like this, which is called an array. Since you're facing the other way, your coordinate basis points in opposite directions, which we can call x prime and y prime, and your movement  can be written like this, or with this array. If we look at the two arrays, they're clearly not the same, but an array alone doesn't completely describe a vector. Each needs a basis to give it context, and when we properly assign them, we see that they are in fact describing the same vector. You can think of elements in the array as individual letters. Just as a sequence of letters only becomes a word in the context of a particular language, an array acquires meaning as a vector when assigned a coordinate basis. And just as different words in two languages can convey the same idea, different representations from two bases can describe the same vector. The vector is the essence  of what's being communicated, regardless of the language  used to describe it. It turns out that scalars also share this coordinate invariance property. In fact, all quantities with this property are members of a group called tensors. Various types of tensors contain different amounts of information. Does that mean there's something that can convey more information than vectors? Absolutely. Say you're designing a video game, and you want to realistically model how water behaves. Even if you have forces acting in the same direction with the same magnitude, depending on how they're oriented, you might see waves or whirls. When force, a vector, is combined with another vector that provides orientation, we have the physical quantity called stress, which is an example of a second order tensor. These tensors are also used outside of video games for all sorts of purposes, including scientific simulations, car designs, and brain imaging. Scalars, vectors, and the tensor family present us with a relatively simple way of making sense of complex ideas and interactions, and as such, they're a prime example of the elegance, beauty, and fundamental usefulness of mathematics.

As an industry and as a community, we seem to have forgotten this. We've forgotten the importance of finding the joy: in losing. MUSIC: Extra Credits Theme Real quick up top: please give a warm, easy welcome to Kelsey, who's doing guest art for this episode. Thanks Kelsey! In games today; we put a HUGE emphasis on winning. We've moved it, from being the goal of most games, to the raison d'etre of most games. Especially in multiplayer environments. In many multiplayer games: we've let winning become more important than having fun. We've let it eclipse the joy of the game. Time and time again; we've all run into players that aren't having fun unless they're winning. And when they're losing; they're actively having a bad time. Losing makes them angry, irritable, or sometimes even mean. It puts people in a bad mood: the very opposite of the thing we usually sit down to play games for. But as hokey as the saying ""Winning isn't everything"" is... ..it's kind of true here. Like, what's really at stake in these games? For most of us; exactly nothing. Nothing materially changes in your life, if you crush a particular round or if you get steamrolled. Heck, in most games: you can usually just pick back up and try again, at no cost whatsoever. Even if you're playing on ladder: those few points up or down don't really mean anything. And they certainly shouldn't ruin your day. And losing isn't actually a bad thing: it's often how we improve. It's easier to learn what you did wrong and what you could do better from a losing game than from a winning one. And it's much easier to gloss over those mistakes and just assume you did everything right, because you won... And you know what? That's where the real joy is: in getting better. At least: that's where it should be. Those of you who have played any of the From Software games know the joy that can be found in losing. If, when you lose; you saw one small thing you could do better, or if you came up with a new strategy to try next time. THAT should be the feeling that we take to every game, that has winning and losing. If you're playing DOTA or Counter-Strike, League or Overwatch, FIFA or Madden. That's the feeling that losing should bring. Sure; it's a little disappointing that you lost, but then you get to think about the ways you could have done better. And get super excited about jumping into that next game, because you want to try your ideas out. You immediately get the chance to test your new hypothesis; and see where you were right, and where you were wrong; that is exciting! Because winning is just a yardstick... ..just a measuring tool to tell you if you've improved your play. It's how you test all thoughts you have about how you might get better and know if you were right. But: that's all it is. It has no inherent value, in and of itself. Now, I know there's going to be a contingent of people out there who will say they get frustrated when they lose, even when they're playing well: when they lose because someone on the team wasn't good. And, yes: I absolutely agree that when someone is actively trolling, that's frustrating and disappointing. Though, more disappointing in humanity than the game, but I digress. When other players are just uncoordinated, or maybe not that great at whatever you're playing, that's an opportunity to improve as well: as a leader and a mentor. I've seen teams filled with people who are mechanically unskilled at a game trounce teams of highly skilled players, because they had one person who helped the team coordinate, and rallied them when they were down. And that's something you can get better at as well. You can get better at being that person. Your team never groups up: What can you say? Or how can you signal more effectively, so that people actually do? Your team ignores the objective to just get into brawls: How can you bring them together to focus on the goal of the game? Or maybe it's just people getting into a defeatist attitude, when things go a little bit against them: How do you rally them to give it one more go? These are as much skills in a team game, as fast mouse-work or clever builds. And getting better at them is an amazing feeling. The most rewarding games I've ever had weren't the ones where I did the coolest shot or stole the objective. They were the ones, where it was clear that the team was about to give up, and, something I said got them to group up, and give it one more go. And in all seriousness: It didn't really matter if we still lost. It felt like we gave it our all, and that feels amazing. We can't invest our self-worth in just winning, just achieving victory in some arbitrary game. Not only is that not healthy at all, but it also bucks against a fundamental truth: In most multiplayer games, at least half of the people are losing: all...the time! No form of entertainment should be miserable for half of its audience, or make half of its audience feel bad about themselves. So we have to find the joy; not in winning, but in improving, or just in playing the game itself. Because if you're not playing for the gameplay: the hook you're playing for is as much of an illusion as any free-to-play treadmill or MMO grind. And we can't fall for that. Because games shouldn't be about rage or disappointment. Games should never cause you to toss the controller or to shout at another person. They're meant to engage us, and much of the time: to be fun. A winning is everything mentality just breeds toxicity. So we need to find the joy in losing: in being beaten in a really good game, in seeing other people's incredible displays of skill, or in learning about the game itself. We need to find the joy in simply playing: win, or lose. Because when you're not having fun: it's time to stop. GG, everyone! GG... MUSIC: Extra Credits Outro "
472,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,nDgIVseTkuE,"The idea of human rights  is that each one of us, no matter who we are or where we are born, is entitled to the same  basic rights and freedoms. Human rights are not privileges, and they cannot be granted or revoked. They are inalienable and universal. That may sound straighforward enough, but it gets incredibly complicated as soon as anyone tries to put the idea into practice. What exactly are the basic human rights? Who gets to pick them? Who enforces them, and how? The history behind the concept of human rights is a long one. Throughout the centuries and across societies, religions, and cultures we have struggled with defining notions of rightfulness, justice, and rights. But one of the most modern affirmations of universal human rights emerged from the ruins of World War II with the creation of the United Nations. The treaty that established the UN gives as one of its purposes to reaffirm faith in  fundamental human rights. And with the same spirit, in 1948, the UN General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This document, written by an international committee chaired by Eleanor Roosevelt, lays the basis for modern international human rights law. The declaration is based on the principle that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. It lists 30 articles recognizing, among other things, the principle of nondiscrimination and the right to life and liberty. It refers to negative freedoms, like the freedom from torture or slavery, as well as positive freedoms, such as the freedom  of movement and residence. It encompasses basic civil and political rights, such as freedom of expression, religion, or peaceful assembly, as well as social, economic, and cultural rights, such as the right to education and the right to freely  choose one's occupation and be paid and treated fairly. The declaration takes no sides as to which rights are more important, insisting on their universality, indivisibility, and interdependence. And in the past decades, international human rights law has grown, deepening and expanding our understanding of what human rights are, and how to better protect them. So if these principles  are so well-developed, then why are human rights abused and ignored time and time again all over the world? The problem in general is that it is not at all easy to universally enforce these rights or to punish transgressors. The UDHR itself, despite being highly authoritative and respected, is a declaration, not a hard law. So when individual countries violate it, the mechanisms to address  those violations are weak. For example, the main bodies within the UN in charge of protecting human rights mostly monitor and investigate violations, but they cannot force states to, say, change a policy or compensate a victim. That's why some critics say it's naive to consider human rights a given in a world where state interests wield so much power. Critics also question the universality of human rights and emphasize that their development has been heavily guided by a small number of mostly Western nations to the detriment of inclusiveness. The result? A general bias in favor  of civil policital liberties over sociopolitical rights and of individual  over collective or groups rights. Others defend universal human rights laws and point at the positive role they have on setting international standards and helping activists in their campaigns. They also point out that not all international  human rights instruments are powerless. For example, the European Convention on Human Rights establishes a court where the 47 member countries and their citizens can bring cases. The court issues binding decisions that each member state must comply with. Human rights law is constantly evolving as are our views and definitions of what the basic human rights should be. For example, how basic or important is the right to democracy or to development? And as our lives are increasingly digital, should there be a right to access the Internet? A right to digital privacy? What do you think? "
473,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,nOewVh0umdM,"As The Age of Heroes faded and monsters were cast from the world Zeus brought the wisest of the Titans Prometheus and his brother Epimethius a task They were to create the animals and form man to populate the upcoming age [[Theme Music plays]] Epimethius whose name means 'Afterthought' was always quick to rush into things. His brother Prometheus or 'Forethought' preferred to consider them first So when Zeus gave them his edict Prometheus began to think but Epimethius set right to work He gave Bears massive size and power. He gave Ravens flight and snakes venom. He gave Lions jaws that bite and claws that rend. He gave Turtles shells to hide in and Deer antlers to gouge He was so enthusiastic in his giving of gifts that when it came time to fashion Man, he was all out. There was nothing left to give them and yet man was supposed to be the greatest of them all So panicked he ran to his brother and asked for help Prometheus considered and then with all the skill and wisdom endowed to him he bent to the task of crafting man He began to sculpt them out of clay and as he worked it soon became clear What gift he chose to give him alone among all the animals? He would make them walk upright like the gods. When he was done sculpting them he bent down and breathed into them life. With this breath he instilled his second gift: Reason and the ability to think much as he did. and finally, he would give them one last gift: better protection than any hide or claw. He flew up to the house of the Sun and stole for mankind fire. Fire from which all art Springs. Fire which makes further creation possible But it was not this great transgression alone for which he would be condemned for there was a second act of defiance which he performed in the service of fledgling man as mankind said about in their new and plentiful world It became clear that they should give thanks and sacrifice to the gods or at least it became clear that the gods Expected it So prometheus helped them prepare a great ox as a sacrifice to Zeus but when the animal was carved up He had them wrapped the best parts in the hide and cover that hide with its disgusting entrails And then he had them take the bones and cover them in shining glistening fat He then offered Zeus to pick one of the piles for his offering Zeus chose the shimmering glistening mount when he went through it though He was outraged to find it was all bones but the decision had been made and this is why Greeks only burnt the bones and the fat of animals when making sacrifices and kept the rest for themselves to feast on Still Zeus did not yet bind prometheus to the great rock. First, he would avenge himself on mankind. because you see Mankind was still just that Mankind and not yet humankind because there were no women so Zeus gathered the gods and had each of them craft some aspect of a new being that he would send to live with mankind and Each of them labored each adding their own gifts until they brought to life a being named Pandora. Which means 'the gift for all' She was the first woman and was wonder to behold. But Zeus was cunning and kind of a jerk and For each gift the gods had imbued her with he also found a sorrow and put it in a box. He then gave her the box telling her never to open it and sent her along to Epimethius' home Knowing he couldn't resist such a refined being Now Prometheus had told Epimethius never to accept gifts from Zeus as they were almost certainly tricks but as always Epimethius did not think before he acted and upon seeing such beauty and such grace invited Pandora to stay with him she showed him the box that Zeus had given her and they put it aside and for some time they didn't open it but eventually Zeus's box was too much of a temptation for Pandora who the gods had endowed with a natural curiosity So she took out the box just to take a quick peek when she lifted the lid all manner of Horrors flew out rage jealousy spite greed sloth covetous and Probably people who check their phones in movie theaters And so she slammed the lid back down, but it was too late. Only one ponderous thing still remained in the bottom Hope which can be seen as the greatest good the thing that makes all other ills endurable or it can be seen as the Final most potent mischief of them all as it is what makes mankind continue to endure all the other sufferings Either way the torrent of wretchedness which plagues humanity to this day flowed from the family of Prometheus the being who loved them most and Thus the first part of Zeus's revenge was complete but Prometheus himself was also Made to suffer and so Zeus called two of his servants force and violence To cease Prometheus and with chains of adamantine bind him to the top of a mountain in the Caucasus but it was not for his benevolence towards man alone that Zeus had him thus bound Oh No. Zeus also had another motive For it was prophesized that like his father before him and his father before that Zeus would be undone by his own son the Problem was Zeus was not exactly what you'd call up Oh monogamous God So there was only one being who had the wisdom and the forethought to divine who the mother might be of the son that would Overthrow him and that was Prometheus So Zeus sent a messenger Hermes to Prometheus high up on the rock to ask him his secret But knowing that if he told it the gods would rule over humanity forever and the human race would never get their turn as lords He said to Hermes go and persuade the sea-waves not to break. You will persuade me. No more easily Hermes then warned him that yet a greater torture awaited him if he did not relent but in knowing his torment was unjust prometheus found strength his body was chained, but without his complicity his spirit could never be so he held to his conviction that helping the mortal race was right and that Brutality and power and the might of tyranny would never rule him Though he was damned his soul was his own and so when Hermes threatened to set upon him a starving Eagle that would Everyday rip through his flesh and feast upon the sweet black blood of his liver if he did not tell the secret Prometheus said ""There is no force that can compel my speech. So let Zeus hurl his blazing bolts and with the white wings of snow and with thunder and with earthquakes Confound the reeling world. None of this will bend my will."" Hermes confounded set the Eagle upon Prometheus and left in frustration and then each day for all time the Eagle would tear his skin to rags and peck out his liver and Each night the liver would regrow and the flesh would knit itself back together. So the process could begin again There are many stories though that tell us that Prometheus eventually became free Hear the tales get muddled and the chronology becomes strange But some say Hercules found him in his wanderings slew the eagle and with his Herculean strength Rent apart the chains of adamant that no other being could undo. Other stories tell of a centaur named Chiron who offered himself as a sacrifice In Prometheus's place for it was said that only if an immortal were to die for him. Would he be able to be free.

But as you study the inscriptions in the near total darkness, two of the eight graduate students accompanying you bump into the alter. Suddenly, two whisps of green smoke burst forth and the walls begin to shake. Fleeing for your lives, you come to a room you passed before with five hallways, including the one to the altar and the one leading back outside. The giant sandglass in the center is now flowing, with less than an hour before it empties, and the rumbling tells you that you don't  want to be around when that happens. From what you recall of your way here, it would take about 20 minutes to reach the exit at a fast pace. You know this is the last junction before the exit, but your trail markings have been erased, and no one remembers the way. If nine of you split up, there should be just enough time for each group to explore one of the four halls ahead and report back to this room, with everyone then making a run down the correct path. There's just one problem; the inscriptions told of the altar's curse: the spirits of the city's King and Queen possessing intruders and leading them to their doom through deception. Remembering the green smoke, you realize two of the students have been cursed. At any time,  one or both of them might lie, though they also might tell the truth. You know for sure that the curse didn't get you, but you don't know which students can't be trusted, and because the possessed students may lie only occasionally, there is no guaranteed way to test them to determine which are cursed. Can you figure out a way to ensure that you all escape? Don't worry about the possessed students attacking or otherwise harming the others. This curse only affects their communication. Pause the video now if you want to figure it out by yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 The first thing to realize is that since you know you aren't possessed, you can explore one of the halls alone. This leaves eight students  for the remaining three paths. Sending groups of four down just two of the paths won't work because if one group came back split two versus two, you'd have to guess who to trust. But splitting them into one pair and two trios would work every time, and here's why. The possessed students might lie, or they might not, but you know there are only two of them, while the other six will always tell the truth. When each group returns to the hall, all of its members will either give the same report or argue about whether they found the exit. If a trio returns in total agreement, then you know none of them are lying. With the pair, you can't be sure either way, but all you need is reliable evidence about three of the four paths. The fourth you can figure out using the process of elimination. Of course, none of this matters if you're lucky enough to find the exit yourself, but otherwise, putting everything together leaves you with three possibilities. If each group gives a consistent answer, either everyone is telling the truth, or the two possessed students  are paired together. In either case, ignore the duo. If there's only one group arguing, both others must be telling the truth, and if there are two conflicts, then the possessed students are in separate groups and you can safely trust the majority in both trios since at least two people in each will be truthful. The temple collapses behind you as greenish vapors escape from two of the students. You're all safe and free from the curse. After that ordeal, you tell your group  they all deserve a vacation, and you just happen to have another expedition coming up. "

These oily films are hundreds of times thinner than a strand of spider silk, yet strong enough to protect the delicate contents of life: the cell's watery cytoplasm,  genetic material, organelles, and all the molecules it needs to survive. How does the membrane work, and where does that strength come from? First of all, it's tempting to think of a cell membrane like the tight skin of a balloon, but it's actually something much more complex. In reality, it's constantly in flux, shifting components back and forth to help the cell take in food, remove waste, let specific molecules in and out, communicate with other cells, gather information about the environment, and repair itself. The cell membrane gets this resilience, flexibility, and functionality by combining a variety  of floating components in what biologists call a fluid mosaic. The primary component of the fluid mosaic is a simple molecule called a phospholipid. A phospholipid has a polar,  electrically-charged head, which attracts water, and a non-polar tail, which repels it. They pair up tail-to-tail in a two layer sheet just five to ten nanometers thick that extends all around the cell. The heads point in towards the cytoplasm and out towards the watery fluid  external to the cell with the lipid tails sandwiched in between. This bilayer, which at body temperature has the consistency of vegetable oil, is studded with other types of molecules, including proteins, carbohydrates, and cholesterol. Cholesterol keeps the membrane  at the right fluidity. It also helps regulate communication between cells. Sometimes, cells talk to each other by releasing and capturing chemicals and proteins. The release of proteins is easy, but the capture of them  is more complicated. That happens through a process called endocytosis in which sections of the membrane engulf substances and transport them into the cell as vesicles. Once the contents have been released, the vesicles are recycled and returned to the cell membrane. The most complex components of the fluid mosaic are proteins. One of their key jobs is to make sure that the right molecules  get in and out of the cell. Non-polar molecules, like oxygen, carbon dioxide, and certain vitamins can cross the phospholipid  bilayer easily. But polar and charged molecules can't make it through the fatty inner layer. Transmembrane proteins stretch across the bilayer to create channels that allow specific molecules through, like sodium and potassium ions. Peripheral proteins floating in the inner face of the bilayer help anchor the membrane to the cell's interior scaffolding. Other proteins in cell membranes can help fuse two different bilayers. That can work to our benefit, like when a sperm fertilizes an egg, but also harm us, as it does when a virus enters a cell. And some proteins move within the fluid mosaic, coming together to form complexes that carry out specific jobs. For instance, one complex might activate cells in our immune system, then move apart when the job is done. Cell membranes are also the site of an ongoing war between us and all the things that want to infect us. In fact, some of the most toxic substances we know of are membrane-breaching proteins made by infectious bacteria. These pore-forming toxins poke giant holes in our cell membranes, causing a cell's contents to leak out. Scientists are working on developing ways to defend against them, like using a nano-sponge  that saves our cells by soaking up  the membrane-damaging toxins. The fluid mosaic is what makes all the functions of life possible. Without a cell membrane, there could be no cells, and without cells, there would be no bacteria, no parasites, no fungi, no animals, and no us. "
476,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,nwjFSQCrShM,"June 1948.The Oval Office. The cabinet gathers for a conference with President Truman. Four days prior, the Soviet Union blockaded the American, British, and French occupied sectors of Berlin. With the divided city located a hundred miles inside the Soviet controlled zone of East Germany, there's no way for American food and fuel the lifeline of its undernourished populace - to get through. The city only has 36 days worth of food remaining and only 45 days of coal. Allied troops are surrounded, outnumbered 62 to 1. The cabinet lays out three options: One,American forces could withdraw... But that would signal that Western democracies are unable to counter Soviet aggression. Two,they could stay in Berlin until the starving population forces them out and accepts Soviet rule out of desperation. Or 3 they could send an armed convoy to open the roads, but that would start another World War. They advise Truman to withdraw. Truman says,""We stay in Berlin. Period."" You remember that series on Hiawatha we did a while back? Those episodes were sponsored by the folks at DomiNations. And we enjoyed doing those so much that when they said - ""Hey, we're about to introduce the Cold War era into our game, you want to do some episodes about that?"" Our answer was ""Heck yeah, we do!"" So today, we are gonna talk about the Berlin Airlift. An event that not only set off the Cold War, but established how it would be fought. You see, after Germany's surrender in WWII, the Allies divided Germany into four occupation zones. The Soviets in the East, and the Americans, British, and French in the West. And Berlin, though it lay in the Soviet zone, was divided as well. The problem was that the Allies had two competing irreconcilable visions for Germany. The Soviets had suffered two German invasions in the span of 30 years. They wanted this country broken and subordinate, so it could never threaten Russia again. They also wanted it to function as a buffer zone to keep the Western powers at bay. In the end, Stalin's goal was a communist puppet state in Germany, and the Allies out of Berlin. But America and Britain believed that Nazi extremism had arisen due to the Great Depression, and that the best chance for a peaceful Europe was a prosperous, democratic Germany. They also hoped that it would be a bulwark against Soviet expansionism. So this joint occupation effort was doomed to failure from the outset. But the final showdown came over currency. Berlin was an economic ruin. Allied bombing had destroyed most of its industrial foundation, and even three years after the war most Berliners lived in the basements of shattered buildings. Some were living on just nine hundred calories a day. The biggest problem was the value of German currency, which was so low that a loaf of bread often cost an entire paycheck. The city's real currency at this point was American cigarettes, and most civilians survived by a combination of black-market, food aid, and prostitution. The Allies made an attempt at currency reform, but this attempt failed when the Soviets sabotaged the effort by printing billions of extra notes. By 1948 the frustrated Western powers were secretly planning to introduce a new currency: the Deutsche Mark, and met behind Stalin's back to discuss forming a West German state. The Soviets found out about this, and in protest, abandoned the Four Power Council. In response, the Western Allies released the new currency. And Stalin had his pretext. On June 23rd, Soviet troops encircled Berlin, blockading the road and rail line the Allies had been using to supply the city. The city's power stations, located in the Soviet sector, cut electricity. The Berlin Blockade had begun, and Truman had to choose between retreat or war. But there was another possibility. The Soviets had interrupted traffic to Berlin before, months earlier. But the Allies had continued supplying their troops via air. Truman wondered whether a similar airlift could supply all of Berlin. After all, the only way you can stop a plane is to shoot at it...which would be an act of war. American generals dismissed this idea as impossible, but the Royal Air Force thought different. After years of war shortages, the British were experts in rationing, and they ran the numbers. They concluded that it would take 4,000 tons of food and fuel per day to keep Berlin from collapsing. But to move that much cargo in C-47 transports would mean over 1,300 flights every 24 hours, and only the Americans had that capacity. Under pressure from Truman, the U.S. generals agreed to try. The first flights began on June 26th. Despite Soviet threats, the anti-aircraft guns stayed silent. They had called Stalin's bluff. But the airlift didn't have enough planes or crews. The Air Force tried bringing in air wings from as far away as Guam, but it still wasn't enough. Two weeks in, the airlift was only delivering 1,000 tons per day - - a quarter of what they needed - and conditions were perilous. The American airport at Tempelhof was a grass field that needed to be patched between landings. An apartment block stood directly on the approach path, its roof just 17 feet below the landing gear. Those C-47s were old leftovers from the war. Coal and flour dust, both of which were explosive by the way, filled the plane's cargo holds. The 24-hour nature of this operation strained both the airmen and their antiquated planes, and all the while, Soviet Yak fighters buzzed the transports, keeping the pressure on. But despite the shortfall on the cargo quota, the airlift spurred a wave of enthusiasm. Across Europe, people set aside wartime grudges in an effort to keep Berlin from starving. Blitz survivors in London sent care packages to Berlin. Many RAF mechanics didn't even wait to be called up... they just grabbed their tool boxes and hitched a flight to Hamburg. Germans, previously hostile to the pilots who had leveled their cities, instead began plying Allied airmen with beer. It was a chaotic cowboy operation. So Washington dispatched a man to tame it. General William Tunner was a taciturn man who loved him some charts. During the war, he had commanded an airlift that flew supplies over the Himalayas and into occupied China. Now he was given the objective of delivering 4,000 tons per day. First thing first, he created a tight schedule. Planes would take off and land at precise 3-minute intervals. The flights would stack at five altitudes, maximizing the number of planes in the air. When the crews landed, they'd have 30 minutes to unload before taking off again. Tunner also enforced maintenance checks, brought in fresh U.S. Navy pilots, and replaced the C-47s with larger-capacity C-54s. To make up for the ground crew shortage, he hired Germans to unload cargo and patch runways, and after translating the maintenance manuals, he assigned former Luftwaffe mechanics to repair planes. Men who had been shooting at each other only three years before, now worked side-by-side. Tunner's shakeup worked. On August 12th the airlift reached its target for the first time. 4,500 tons. Then - Tunner discovered that one of his pilots, Gail Halvorsen, had been making unauthorized cargo drops. Every time Halvorsen came in for a landing, he would drop off little handkerchief parachutes containing parcels of candy to the children that gathered near the runway. Berliners loved it, and Tunner saw the PR potential. He ordered the candy drops expanded and sent Halvorsen on a press tour back home. The airlift, a humanitarian effort without traditional military heroes, finally had a public face. And that PR victory was good news, because winter was coming. The Soviets had been stalling diplomatically for exactly this reason. Surely, deteriorating weather would put a stop to this airlift for good. Fog came in heavy that season. At times, it lay so thick on the runways that ground crews had to crawl, for fear of walking into an unseen propeller. Aircraft landed in zero visibility with iced-up engines. They collided in mid-air, they smashed into mountain ranges. Exhausted pilots fell asleep at the stick. Meteorologists, circling in B-29s, alerted ground control of 15-minute breaks in the weather that would allow flights to get through. And somehow they did! On New Year's Eve, 1948, Allied forces delivered over 6,000 tons a new record. And as winter passed and the weather began to let up, the airlift had began to deliver more supplies than the city had ever received by rail. This success emboldened anti-Soviet politicians within Berlin. In September, Ernst Reuter, elected mayor in 1947 but blocked from taking his seat by the Soviets, gave a fiery speech before a crowd of 300,000 Berliners, imploring the world not to abandon the city to totalitarianism. That December, he won the mayor's office, appearing around the world as the face of free Berlin. In retaliation, the Soviets installed their own communist city government in East Berlin. Stalin's strategy had backfired. Instead of preventing a West German state, he had fueled it. Far from revealing Allied weaknesses, he had allowed them to take the moral high ground - - demonstrating their commitment and turning Germans from an occupied people into comrades. And the blockade was damaging East Berlin's economy. Its factories couldn't function without goods from the Western sector. The Soviets had been outmaneuvered. On May 12th, 1949, Soviet soldiers removed the roadblocks, and allowed the first American supply convoy to pass into Berlin. That road would never close again. In 15 months of operation the airlift delivered over 2.4 million tons of food and fuel, saving Berlin from famine. 79 Allied personnel and German civilians lost their lives to the effort, and the world would never be the same. Stalin's willingness to starve civilians marked a turning point, uniting Western Europe in a coalition to contain Soviet influence. A month before the end of the blockade, this new alliance - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO - was formally signed into being. And within weeks, West Germany formally became its own country, followed by Communist East Germany. Europe was divided in half, and two months later the Soviets tested their first atomic bomb. It was the beginning of a new kind of war. One of political influence, fought by great powers over proxy states. A war of threat and restraint, where governments tested just how far they could push the other, without starting a full-scale conflict. But the Soviets and the Americans would never again square off as directly as they did during the airlift. When nuclear armament is in play, that is just not the kind of gamble you take.

477,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,oe64p-QzhNE,"If you've watched the news or followed politics chances are you've heard the term Orwellian thrown around  in one context or another. But have you ever stopped to think about what it really means, or why it's used so often? The term was named  after British author Eric Blair known by his pen name George Orwell. Because his most famous work, the novel ""1984,"" depicts an oppressive society under a totalitarian government, ""Orwellian"" is often used simply to mean authoritarian. But using the term in this way not only fails to fully convey Orwell's message, it actually risks doing precisely what he tried to warn against. Orwell was indeed opposed  to all forms of tyranny, spending much of his life fighting against anti-democratic forces of both the left-wing and the right. But he was also deeply concerned with how such ideologies proliferate. And one of his most profound insights was the importance that language plays in shaping our thoughts and opinions. The government of ""1984""'s Oceania controls its people's actions and speech in some ways that are obvious. Their every move and word  is watched and heard, and the threat of what happens  to those who step out of line is always looming overhead. Other forms of control are not so obvious. The population is inundated  with a constant barrage of propaganda made up of historical facts and statistics manufactured in the Ministry of Truth. The Ministry of Peace is the military. Labor camps are called ""Joycamps."" Political prisoners are detained and tortured in the Ministry of Love. This deliberate irony is an example of doublespeak, when words are used not to convey meaning but to undermine it, corrupting the very ideas they refer to. The regime's control of language goes even further, eliminating words from  the English language to create the official  dialect of Newspeak, a crudely limited collection of acronyms and simple concrete nouns lacking any words complex enough to encourage nuanced or critical thought. This has an effect on the psyche Orwell calls, ""Doublethink,"" a hypnotic state of cognitive dissonance in which one is compelled to disregard their own perception in place of the officially dictated version of events, leaving the individual  completely dependent on the State's definition  of reality itself. The result is a world in which even the privacy of one's  own thought process is violated, where one may be found guilty of thoughtcrime by talking in their sleep, and keeping a diary  or having a love affair equals a subversive act of rebellion. This might sound like something that can only happen in totalitarian regimes, but Orwell was warning us about the potential for this occurring even in democratic societies. And this is why ""authoritarian"" alone does not ""Orwellian"" make. In his essay, ""Politics and the English Language,"" he described techniques like using pretentious words to project authority, or making atrocities sound acceptable by burying them in euphemisms and convoluted sentence structures. But even more mundane abuses of language can affect the way we think about things. The words you see and hear in everyday advertising have been crafted to appeal to you and affect your behavior, as have the soundbites and talking points of political campaigns which rarely present the most nuanced perspective on the issues. And the way that we use ready-made phrases and responses gleaned from media reports or copied from the Internet makes it easy to get away  with not thinking too deeply or questioning your assumptions. So the next time you hear someone use the word Orwellian, pay close attention. If they're talking about the deceptive and manipulative use of language, they're on the right track. If they're talking about mass surveillance and intrusive government, they're describing something authoritarian but not necessarily Orwellian. And if they use it as an all-purpose word for any ideas they dislike, it's possible their statements  are more Orwellian than whatever it is they're criticizing. Words have the power to shape thought. Language is the currency of politics, forming the basis of society from the most common, everyday interactions to the highest ideals. Orwell urged us to protect our language because ultimately our ability to think and communicate clearly is what stands between us and a world where war is peace and freedom is slavery. "
478,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,oumxCLy_N9k,"Khmer Empire, around 1150. Water flows over a sacred riverbed. It spills in waterfalls over images of the gods, running past faces peering out of nearby rocks. Clear and clean, it burbles over symbols of the god Shiva, blessing it as it sweeps downstream to the jewel of the Khmer Empire. To the City of God Kings, to the city of Angkor. It joins a massive canal network, passing rice fields, monumental wooden palaces, enormous reservoirs, schools, hospitals, and gridded roads, some of which are 250 feet wide. And then, there are the temples. Huge stone edifices carved with gods and heavenly beings washed white in plaster and shining with gold leaf. Yet on the canal are huge blocks floating downstream on bamboo rafts, quarried to build something even grander: A palace so massive that when it's one day abandoned and its name forgotten, people will simply refer to it with the Khmer words for 'Temple' and 'City'; The sacred metropolis of Angkor Wat. [Music: Birth of the People] At its height, the city of Angkor was by several measures, the largest city of the medieval era, with a million people and a footprint larger than modern-day New York. It was arguably the world's largest pre-industrial city. It contained roads as wide as modern airport runways and reservoirs that remain, to this day, the largest [hand-cut] on the planet. An urban sprawl of 390 square miles, dominated by rice farms supporting its population. And it even had a network of public hospitals, providing free medical care in its later days. And of course, at its center, stood the massive structure of Angkor Wat, a building complex containing more stone than the Great Pyramid of Giza and covering four times the acreage of Vatican City. A place that since its construction nearly 900 years ago, has never been usurped as the largest religious structure on Earth. But given all that grandiosity, it's amazing that Angkor is rarely mentioned alongside other famous cities of the medieval world, like Baghdad, Constantinople, and Tenochtitlan. The main reason for that up until a decade ago is that we didn't really grasp how large Angkor really was. Apart from a few stone dedications inscriptions and accounts from Chinese diplomats, our understanding of Angkor comes from studying their architecture, religious artwork, and archaeological sites, which has been difficult. See, apart from public infrastructure and temples, all the buildings in Angkor were made of wood, a material that quickly disintegrated once the Khmer abandoned the city to the jungle. On top of that, political instability has kept the site inaccessible to modern archaeologists. After World War II, Cambodia experienced decades of conflict, ranging from Anti-Colonial insurgencies, a civil war, spillover from the Vietnam War, the genocidal reign of the Khmer Rouge, and a military intervention by Vietnam itself. And at certain points, the temples themselves became battlefields, with fire fights leaving bullet holes in Angkor Wat. Even today, excavation is difficult due to the land mines and unexploded ordnance left behind by the conflict. But in 2007, an archaeological team flew over the Angkor area and scanned it using L.I.D.A.R. a system that gathers distances via a pulsed laser. With that data gathered, they deleted the layer of return signals that had bounced off the tree canopy and were left with something previously invisible: The mega city of Angkor; a city founded by God Kings that harnessed the monsoon. The Kulen Hills, circa 802 CE. A holy man has come from India to conduct a ritual. This man is from a century-long line of Hindu traders and missionaries who brought their beliefs to this remote kingdom. And the man who invited him, the man at the center of this ritual, is Jayavarman II. Once only one of a collection of Khmer Kings, Jayavarman is a ruler on the rise. After battling his former overlords to the East and moving Northwest, he's consolidated power among other ethnic Khmer kingdoms through marriage, alliances, and war. His rule, however, is not steady. Other Khmer kingdoms still resist him. And right now, he's still technically in full retreat. Over his life, he will move his capital 5 times, and his latest center, a strategic stronghold in the Kulen Hills, was chosen for its defensibility. But this ritual will give him the legitimacy he so desires. The Brahmin finishes and transfers the sacred Linga, the symbol of the god Shiva, to Jayavarman. He is now the manifestation of Shiva, the supreme lord excellent, the Universal Monarch, and god-king of the rising Khmer Empire. He will raise cities and build a type of Indian temple foreign to the region, one shaped like the sacred five peaked Mt. Meru, the Olympus of the Hindu universe. And around it, he will build a moat representing the mythical sea of milk said to surround those sacred peaks. Now, his building projects were small in comparison with what would come later, but Jayavarman did 2 critical things. First, he legitimized Khmer power by introducing the Cult of the God-King, and second, by building his new capital, he'd initiated centuries of city building in what would come to be known as the empire's ""Angkorian Period."" But to build a vast city in the Cambodian Wilds, these newly-minted Angkorians, as we call those Khmer who dwelled in the capital, would need to tame the natural environment. See, Cambodia is a monsoon ecosystem, with extremely dry and wet periods. During the dry season, the earth can turn dusty and temperatures rise over 100 degrees. While in the wet peroids, torrential rains inundate banks, reverse courses of rivers, and raise lake levels by 30ft. In fact, villages along the Great Lake are still built on 30 foot stilts today. However, much like the Nile's floods helped enrich its banks with fertile mud, these seasonal floods were key to rice cultivation. To create a sustainable kingdom, Jayavarman's successors would need to harness the power of the monsoon and bend it to their will. Therefore, they broke ground on an intricate hydraulic system meant to channel the water into the largest hand-cut reservoirs in the world. They engineered canals, dikes, and spillways at precise angles, taking advantage of gravity to divert water from nearby rivers and streams in the mountains, effectively creating the current environment of the Angkor region. During the wet season, spillways would evacuate excess water, and during the dry season, stored water could be used for agriculture and would soak into the surrounding earth, replenishing dried-out soil. And actually, surface evaporation may have even helped bring groundwater to the surface. But these works were not just practical. They also served a religious purpose, with the mountain-shaped temples at the center of each reservoir mirroring the divine mountain. And the water itself was sacred. During the dry season, craftsmen ventured into the hills to create the striking monument we saw at the opening of this episode. When the streams disappeared, sculptors would gather at the convergence of two streams and carve hundreds of Linga on the dry bed. By running over them, the water would be blessed by Shiva and imbued with the sacred act of creation. ""So what is a Linga, exactly?"" you ask. Well, a Linga is a penis. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) The symbol of Shiva. Its corresponding female symbol is the Yoni, a sort of square vessel the Linga sits in. Together, they show the creative, life-giving power of the gods. In most rituals, they'd wash it with milk. Hinduism: Not shy about biology. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Anyway, it must have worked, because the society that this sacred water built, was one of the most creative in Southeast Asia. They quarried great blocks of sandstone out of the Kulen Hills, carving them out by hammering long iron poles into the rock, before sending them downstream on bamboo rafts. When they arrived at the building site, laborers, either drafted labor or prisoners of war, would finish and assemble the blocks, grinding one on top of the other, back and forth, until they sat smooth. And groups of artisans would then carve bass reliefs in the soft face of the sandstone. For decades, the Khmer kings expanded their capital. They built religious retreats, which also served as schools, and perfected their own style of temple carving. ""Now, why so much focus on temples?"" you ask. Well, because they were administrative centers as well as religious institutions. Collecting taxes, coordinating local projects, and sending any extra revenue to the royal treasury. But all that building meant that the old capital was starting to get crowded. By the time the 4th Khmer monarch came along, beating his rival to the throne in a great naval battle, he'd had enough. So he decided to move the capital North, closer to the water sources and away from the tangle of his predecessors' mausoleums. He had to start thinking about building his own mausoleum. After all, he had leprosy and was eager to make his mark. So, for the next century, he and his successors would build a city of ashrams and canals, of raised roads and beautiful reservoirs, and of intricate wooden palaces lost to time, whose beauty we can only speculate. But what we don't have to speculate about is the stone temples. The temples that became grander with each generation and the carvings more graceful. Roughly 70 years after the city's founding, a group of courtiers commissioned the breathtaking women's temple. Unlike previous temples, this one was carved in red sandstone, giving its whole structure a pleasant pink glow. Though not large, bass relief carvings cover every inch of its surface, with the triangular spaces above doors displaying creatures from Hindu mythology. Most notable are the carvings that give the building its name. The beautiful demigoddess that stands on nearly every wall and column. These elements would become an ongoing motif in Angkorian art. Decades later, a god-king may have stood in this temple and looked at these goddesses, so serene, ethereal, full of life. Yes, he would have something like it at his grand temple he was raising. The greatest in the world: Angkor Wat. Special thanks to Educational Tier patrons Ahmed Ziad Turk and Joseph Blaim. [Music: Nokor Thom by Tiffany Roman] "
479,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,p3q5zWCw8J4,"In many ways,  our memories make us who we are, helping us remember our past, learn and retain skills, and plan for the future. And for the computers that often act as extensions of ourselves, memory plays much the same role, whether it's a two-hour movie, a two-word text file, or the instructions for opening either, everything in a computer's memory takes the form of basic units called bits, or binary digits. Each of these is stored in a memory cell that can switch between two states for two possible values, 0 and 1. Files and programs consist of millions of these bits, all processed in the central processing unit, or CPU, that acts as the computer's brain. And as the number of bits needing to be processed grows exponentially, computer designers face  a constant struggle between size, cost, and speed. Like us, computers have short-term memory for immediate tasks, and long-term memory  for more permanent storage. When you run a program, your operating system allocates area within the short-term memory for performing those instructions. For example, when you press a key in a word processor, the CPU will access one of these locations to retrieve bits of data. It could also modify them, or create new ones. The time this takes is known  as the memory's latency. And because program instructions must be processed quickly and continuously, all locations within the short-term memory can be accessed in any order, hence the name random access memory. The most common type of RAM is dynamic RAM, or DRAM. There, each memory cell consists of a tiny transistor and a capacitor that store electrical charges, a 0 when there's no charge, or a 1 when charged. Such memory is called dynamic because it only holds charges briefly before they leak away, requiring periodic recharging to retain data. But even its low latency of 100 nanoseconds is too long for modern CPUs, so there's also a small, high-speed internal memory cache made from static RAM. That's usually made up of six interlocked transistors which don't need refreshing. SRAM is the fastest memory  in a computer system, but also the most expensive, and takes up three times  more space than DRAM. But RAM and cache can only hold data as long as they're powered. For data to remain once the device is turned off, it must be transferred into a long-term storage device, which comes in three major types. In magnetic storage,  which is the cheapest, data is stored as a magnetic pattern on a spinning disc coated with magnetic film. But because the disc must rotate to where the data is located in order to be read, the latency for such drives is 100,000  times slower than that of DRAM. On the other hand, optical-based storage like DVD and Blu-ray also uses spinning discs, but with a reflective coating. Bits are encoded as light and dark spots using a dye that can be read by a laser. While optical storage media are cheap and removable, they have even slower latencies  than magnetic storage and lower capacity as well. Finally, the newest and fastest types of long-term storage are solid-state drives, like flash sticks. These have no moving parts, instead using floating gate transistors that store bits by trapping  or removing electrical charges within their specially designed  internal structures. So how reliable are these billions of bits? We tend to think of computer memory as stable and permanent, but it actually degrades fairly quickly. The heat generated from a device and its environment will eventually demagnetize hard drives, degrade the dye in optical media, and cause charge leakage  in floating gates. Solid-state drives also have an additional weakness. Repeatedly writing to floating gate transistors corrodes them, eventually rendering them useless. With data on most current storage media having less than a ten-year life expectancy, scientists are working to exploit the physical properties of materials down to the quantum level in the hopes of making  memory devices faster, smaller, and more durable. For now, immortality remains out of reach, for humans and computers alike. "

On the way, he stopped to go sightseeing in Megara, a town in Greece. Out in the sun for too long, he suffered heatstroke and died on his journey back to Italy. On his deathbed, Virgil thought about the manuscript  he had been working on for over ten years, an epic poem that he called the ""Aeneid."" Unsatisfied with the final edit, he asked his friends to burn it, but they refused, and soon after Virgil's death, Augustus ordered it to be published. Why was Augustus so interested in saving Virgil's poem? The Romans had little tradition of writing serious literature and Virgil wanted to create a poem to rival the ""Iliad"" and ""Odyssey"" of Ancient Greece. The ""Aeneid,"" a 9,896 line poem, spans twelve separate sections, or books, the first six of which mirror the structure of the ""Odyssey"" and the last six echo the ""Iliad."" Also like the Greek epics, The ""Aeneid"" is written entirely in dactylic hexameter. In this meter, each line has six syllable groups called feet made up of dactyls which go long, short, short, and spondees which go long, long. So the famous opening line in the original Latin starts, ""Arma Virvmqve Cano,"" which can be translated as ""I sing of arms and the man,"" arms, meaning battles and warfare, another ""Iliad"" reference, and the man being the hero Aeneas. To understand the ""Aeneid,"" it's necessary to examine the unsettled nature of Roman politics in the second half of the 1st century B.C. In 49 B.C., Julius Caesar,  Augustus's great uncle, triggered nearly 20 years of civil war when he led his army against the Roman Republic. After introducing a dictatorship, he was assassinated. Only after Augustus's victory over Marc Antony and Cleopatra in 31 B.C. did peace return to Rome and Augustus became the emperor. Virgil aimed to capture this sense of a new era and of the great sacrifices that the Romans had endured. He wanted to give the Romans a fresh sense of their origins, their past, and their potential. By connecting the founding of Rome to the mythological stories that his audience knew so well, Virgil was able to link his hero Aeneas to the character of Augustus. In the epic poem, Aeneas is on a quest to establish a new home for his people. This duty, or pietas  as the Romans called it, faces all kinds of obstacles. Aeneas risks destruction  in the ruins of Troy, agonizes over love when he meets the beautiful Queen of Carthage, Dido, and in one of the most vivid passages in all of ancient literature, has to pass through the underworld. On top of all that, he must then fight to win a homeland for his people around the future sight of Rome. Virgil presents Aeneas as a sort of model for Augustus, and that's probably one of the reasons the emperor was so eager to save the poem from destruction. But Virgil didn't stop there. In some sections, Aeneas even has visions of Rome's future and of Augustus himself. Virgil presents Augustus as a victor, entering Rome in triumph and shows him expanding  the Roman Empire. Perhaps most importantly, he's hailed as only the third Roman leader in 700 years to shut the doors of the Temple of Janus signifying the arrival of permanent peace. But there's a twist. Virgil only read Augustus three selected extracts of the story and that was Augustus's  entire exposure to it. Some of the other sections could be seen as critical, if not subtly subversive about the emperor's achievements. Aeneas, again a model for Augustus, struggles with his duty and often seems a reluctant hero. He doesn't always live up to the behavior expected of a good Roman leader. He struggles to balance mercy and justice. By the end, the reader is left wondering about the future of Rome and the new government of Augustus. Perhaps in wanting the story published, Augustus had been fooled by his own desire for self-promotion. As a result, Virgil's story has survived to ask questions about the nature of power and authority ever since. "
481,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,p4pWafuvdrY,"In 1992, a cargo ship carrying bath toys  got caught in a storm. Shipping containers washed overboard, and the waves swept 28,000 rubber ducks and other toys into the North Pacific. But they didn’t stick together. Quite the opposite– the ducks have since washed up  all over the world, and researchers have used their paths to chart a better understanding of ocean currents. Ocean currents are driven  by a range of sources: the wind, tides, changes in water density, and the rotation of the Earth. The topography of the ocean floor  and the shoreline modifies those motions, causing currents to speed up, slow down, or change direction. Ocean currents fall into  two main categories: surface currents and deep ocean currents. Surface currents control the motion of the top 10 percent  of the ocean’s water, while deep-ocean currents mobilize the other 90 percent. Though they have different causes, surface and deep ocean currents  influence each other in an intricate dance that keeps  the entire ocean moving. Near the shore, surface currents are driven  by both the wind and tides, which draw water back and forth  as the water level falls and rises. Meanwhile, in the open ocean, wind is the  major force behind surface currents. As wind blows over the ocean, it drags the top layers  of water along with it. That moving water pulls on  the layers underneath, and those pull on the ones beneath them. In fact, water as deep as 400 meters is still affected by the wind  at the ocean’s surface. If you zoom out to look at the patterns  of surface currents all over the earth, you’ll see that they form  big loops called gyres, which travel clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise  in the southern hemisphere. That’s because of the way  the Earth’s rotation affects the wind patterns that give rise to these currents. If the earth didn’t rotate, air and water would simply  move back and forth between low pressure at the equator and high pressure at the poles. But as the earth spins, air moving from the equator to the North Pole is deflected eastward, and air moving back down is deflected westward. The mirror image happens  in the southern hemisphere, so that the major streams of wind form loop-like patterns around the ocean basins. This is called the Coriolis Effect. The winds push the ocean beneath  them into the same rotating gyres. And because water holds onto heat  more effectively than air, these currents help redistribute  warmth around the globe. Unlike surface currents, deep ocean currents are driven primarily by changes in the density of seawater. As water moves towards the North Pole, it gets colder. It also has a higher  concentration of salt, because the ice crystals that form  trap water while leaving salt behind. This cold, salty water is more dense, so it sinks, and warmer surface water takes its place, setting up a vertical current called thermohaline circulation. Thermohaline circulation of deep water and wind-driven surface currents combine to form a winding loop called the Global Conveyor Belt. As water moves from the depths of the ocean to the surface, it carries nutrients that nourish the  microorganisms which form the base of many  ocean food chains. The global conveyor belt is the longest current in the world, snaking all around the globe. But it only moves a few  centimeters per second. It could take a drop of water a thousand years to make the full trip. However, rising sea temperatures are causing the conveyor belt to seemingly slow down. Models show this causing havoc with  weather systems on both sides of the Atlantic, and no one knows what would happen if it continues to slow or if it stopped altogether. The only way we’ll be able to forecast correctly and prepare accordingly will be to continue to study currents  and the powerful forces that shape them. "
482,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,p7HKvqRI_Bo,"In the 1600s the Dutch East India Company  employed hundreds of ships to trade gold, porcelain, spices,  and silks around the globe. But running this massive  operation wasn’t cheap. In order to fund their expensive voyages, the company turned to private citizens– individuals who could invest money to support the trip in exchange for a share  of the ship’s profits. This practice allowed the company  to afford even grander voyages, increasing profits for both  themselves and their savvy investors. Selling these shares in coffee houses  and shipping ports across the continent, the Dutch East India Company unknowingly invented the world’s first stock market. Since then, companies have been collecting funds from willing investors to support all kinds of businesses. And today, the stock market has schools, careers, and even whole television channels dedicated to understanding it. But the modern stock market is  significantly more complicated than its original incarnation. So how do companies and investors use the market today? Let’s imagine a new coffee company that decides to launch on the market. First, the company will advertise itself to big investors. If they think the company is a good idea, they get the first crack at investing, and then sponsor the company’s initial public offering, or IPO. This launches the company onto the official public market, where any company or individual who believes the business could be profitable might buy a stock. Buying stocks makes those investors  partial owners in the business. Their investment helps  the company to grow, and as it becomes more successful, more buyers may see potential  and start buying stocks. As demand for those stocks increases, so does their price, increasing the cost for prospective buyers, and raising the value of the company's stocks people already own. For the company, this increased interest helps fund new initiatives, and also boosts its overall market value by showing how many people  are willing to invest in their idea. However, if for some reason a company  starts to seem less profitable the reverse can also happen. If investors think their stock value is going to decline, they’ll sell their stocks with the hopes of making a profit before the company loses more value. As stocks are sold and demand  for the stock goes down, the stock price falls, and with it, the company’s market value. This can leave investors with big losses– unless the company starts to look profitable again. This see-saw of supply and demand is influenced by many factors. Companies are under the unavoidable influence of market forces– such as the fluctuating  price of materials, changes in production technology, and the shifting costs of labor. Investors may be worried about  changes in leadership, bad publicity, or larger factors like  new laws and trade policies. And of course, plenty of investors are simply ready  to sell valuable stocks and pursue personal interests. All these variables cause day-to-day noise in the market, which can make companies appear more or less successful. And in the stock market, appearing to lose value often leads to losing investors, and in turn, losing actual value. Human confidence in the market has the power to trigger everything from economic booms  to financial crises. And this difficult-to-track  variable is why most professionals promote reliable long term investing over trying to make quick cash. However, experts are constantly  building tools in efforts to increase their chances of success in this highly unpredictable system. But the stock market is not just  for the rich and powerful. With the dawn of the Internet, everyday investors can buy stocks in many of the exact same ways  a large investor would. And as more people educate themselves  about this complex system they too can trade stocks, support the businesses they believe in, and pursue their financial goals. The first step is getting invested. "
483,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,p7fXa2Occ_U,"""Hi, Bob."" ""Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great."" Have you ever wondered how your dog experiences the world? Here's what she sees. Not terribly interesting. But what she smells, that's a totally different story. And it begins at her wonderfully  developed nose. As your dog catches the first hints of fresh air, her nose's moist, spongy outside helps capture any scents the breeze carries. The ability to smell separately with each nostril, smelling in stereo, helps to determine the direction  of the smell's source so that within the first  few moments of sniffing, the dog starts to become aware of not just what kind of things are out there but also where they're located. As air enters the nose, a small fold of tissue divides it into two separate folds, one for breathing and one just for smelling. This second airflow enters a region filled with highly specialized  olfactory receptor cells, several hundred millions of them, compaired to our five million. And unlike our clumsy way of breathing  in and out through the same passage, dogs exhale through slits  at the side of their nose, creating swirls of air that help draw in new odor molecules and allow odor concentration to build up over mulitple sniffs. But all that impressive nasal architecture wouldn't be much help without something to process the loads of information the nose scoops up. And it turns out that the olfactory system dedicated to proessing smells takes up many times more relative brain area in dogs than in humans. All of this allows dogs to distinguish and remember a staggering variety of specific scents at concentrations up to 100 million times less than what our noses can detect. If you can smell a spritz of perfume in a small room, a dog would have no trouble smelling it in an enclosed stadium and distinguishing its ingredients, to boot. And everything in the street, every passing person or car, any contents of the neighbor's trash, each type of tree, and all the birds and insects in it has a distinct odor profile telling your dog what it is, where it is, and which direction it's moving in. Besides being much  more powerful than ours, a dog's sense of smell can pick up things that can't even be seen at all. A whole separate olfactory system, called the vomeronasal organ, above the roof of the mouth, detects the hormones all animals, Including humans, naturally release. It lets dogs identify potential mates, or distinguish between friendly  and hostile animals. It alerts them to our various  emotional states, and it can even tell them when someone is pregnant or sick. Because olfaction is more primal than other senses, bypassing the thalamus to connect directly to the brain structures involving emotion and instinct, we might even say a dog's perception  is more immediate and visceral than ours. But the most amazing thing about  your dog's nose is that it can traverse time. The past appears in tracks  left by passersby, and by the warmth of a recently parked car where the residue of where you've been and what you've done recently. Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees are aromatic bulletin boards  carrying messages of who's been by, what they've been eating, and how they're feeling. And the future is in the breeze, alerting them to something or someone approaching long before you see them. Where we see and hear something at a single moment, a dog smells an entire story from start to finish. In some of the best examples of canine-human collaboration, dogs help us by sharing and reacting to those stories. They can respond with kindness to people in distress, or with aggression to threats because stress and anger manifest as a cloud of hormones recognizable to the dog's nose. With the proper training, they can even alert us  to invisible threats ranging from bombs to cancer. As it turns out, humanity's best friend is not one who experiences  the same things we do, but one whose incredible nose reveals  a whole other world beyond our eyes. "
484,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,pM_IzEAv5d4,"Is she turning towards you or away from you? No one can agree. She's the mysterious subject of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer's ""Girl with the Pearl Earring,"" a painting often referred to as the 'Mona Lisa of the North.' Belonging to a Dutch style of idealized, sometimes overly expressive paintings known as tronies, the ""Girl with the Pearl Earring"" has the allure and subtlety characteristic of Vermeer's work. But this painting stands apart from the quiet narrative scenes that we observe from afar in many of Vermeer's paintings. A girl reading a letter. A piano lesson. A portrait artist at work. These paintings give us a sense of intimacy while retaining their distance, a drawn curtain often emphasizes the separation. We can witness a milkmaid serenely pouring a bowl of milk, but that milk isn't for us. We're only onlookers. The studied composition in Vermeer's paintings invokes a balanced harmony. With the checkered floor in many of his works, Vermeer demonstrates his command of perspective and foreshortening. That's a technique that uses distortion to give the illusion of an object receding into the distance. Other elements, like sight lines, mirrors, and light sources describe the moment through space and position. The woman reading a letter by an open window is precisely placed so the window can reflect her image back to the viewer. Vermeer would even hide the leg of an easel for the sake of composition. The absence of these very elements brings the ""Girl with the Pearl Earring"" to life. Vermeer's treatment of light and shadow, or chiaroscuro, uses a dark, flat background to further spotlight her three-dimensionality. Instead of being like a set piece in a theatrical narrative scene, she becomes a psychological subject. Her eye contact and slightly parted lips, as if she is about to say something, draw us into her gaze. Traditional subjects of portraiture were often nobility or religious figures. So why was Vermeer painting  an anonymous girl? In the 17th century, the city of Delft, like the Netherlands in general, had turned against ruling aristocracy and the Catholic church. After eight decades of rebellion against Spanish power, the Dutch came to favor the idea of self-rule and a political republic. Cities like Delft were unsupervised by kings or bishops, so many artists like Vermeer were left without traditional patrons. Fortunately, business innovation spearheaded by  the Dutch East India Company transformed the economic landscape in the Netherlands. It created a merchant class and new type of patron. Wishing to be represented in the paintings they financed, these merchants preferred  middle class subjects depicted in spaces that looked like their own homes surrounded by familiar objects. The maps that appear in Vermeer's paintings, for example, were considered fashionable and worldly by the merchant class of what is known as the Dutch Golden Age. The oriental turban worn by the ""Girl with the Pearl Earring"" also emphasizes the worldliness of the merchant class, and the pearl itself, a symbol of wealth, is actually an exaggeration. Vermeer couldn't have afforded a real pearl of its size. It was likely just a glass or tin drop varnished to look like a pearl. This mirage of wealth is mirrored in the painting itself. In greater context, the pearl appears round and heavy, but a detailed view shows that it's just a floating smudge of paint. Upon close inspection, we are reminded of Vermeer's power as an illusion maker. While we may never know the real identity of the ""Girl with the Pearl Earring,"" we can engage with her portrait in a way that is unforgettable. As she hangs in her permanent home in the Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague, her presence is simultaneously penetrating and subtle. In her enigmatic way, she represents the birth of a modern perspective on economics, politics, and love. "
485,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,paXKoZ1pr5w,"Would you like to know  what's in our future? What's going to happen tomorrow, next year, or even a millennium from now? Well, you're not alone. Everyone from governments to militaries to industry leaders do, as well, and they all employ people called futurists who attempt to forecast the future. Some are able to do this with surprising accuracy. In the middle of the 20th century, a think tank known as the RAND Corporation consulted dozens of scientists and futurists who together forecast many of the technologies we take for granted today, including artificial organs, the use of birth control pills, and libraries able to look up research material for the reader. One way futurists arrive at their predictions is by analyzing movements and trends in society, and charting the paths they are likely to follow into the future with varying degrees of probability. Their work informs the decisions of policymakers and world leaders, enabling them to weigh options for the future that otherwise could not have been imagined in such depth or detail. Of course, there are obvious limits to how certain anyone can be about the future. There are always unimaginable discoveries that arise which would make no sense to anyone in the present. Imagine, for example, transporting a physicist from the middle of the 19th century into the 21st. You explain to him that a strange material exists, Uranium 235, that of its own accord can produce enough energy to power an entire city, or destroy it one fell swoop. ""How can such energy come from nowhere?"" he would demand to know. ""That's not science, that's magic."" And for all intents and purposes, he would be right. His 19th century grasp of science includes no knowledge of radioactivity or nuclear physics. In his day, no forecast of the future could have predicted X-rays, or the atom bomb, let alone the theory of relativity or quantum mechanics. As Arthur C. Clarke has said, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" How can we prepare, then, for a future that will be as magical to us as our present would appear to someone from the 19th century? We may think our modern technology and advanced data analysis techniques might allow us to predict the future with much more accuracy than our 19th century counterpart, and rightly so. However, it's also true that our  technological progress has brought with it new increasingly  complex and unpredictable challenges. The stakes for future generations to be able to imagine the unimaginable are higher than ever before. So the question remains: how do we do that? One promising answer has actually been with us since the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution that laid the foundation  for our modern world. During this time of explosive development and invention, a new form of literature, science fiction, also emerged. Inspired by the innovations of the day, Jules Verne, H.G. Wells, and other prolific thinkers explored fantastic scenarios, depicting new frontiers of human endeavor. And throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, storytellers have continued to share their visions of the future and correctly predicted many aspects of the world we inhabit decades later. In ""Brave New World,"" Aldous Huxley foretold  the use of antidepressants in 1932, long before such medication  became popular. In 1953, Ray Bradbury's ""Fahrenheit 451,"" forecast earbuds, ""thimble radios,"" in his words. And in ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" Arthur C. Clarke described a portable, flat-screen news pad in 1968. In works that often combine entertainment and social commentary, we are invited to suspend our disbelief and consider the consequences of radical shifts in familiar  and deeply engrained institutions. In this sense, the best science fiction fulfills  the words of philosopher Michel Foucault, ""I'm no prophet. My job is making windows where there were once walls."" Free from the constraints of the present and our assumptions of what's impossible, science fiction serves as a useful tool for thinking outside of the box. Many futurists recognize this, and some are beginning to employ science fictions writers in their teams. Just recently, a project called iKnow proposed scenarios that look much  like science fiction stories. They include the discovery of an alien civilization, development of a way for humans and animals to communicate flawlessly, and radical life extension. So, what does the future hold? Of course, we can't know for certain, but science fiction shows us many possibilities. Ultimately, it is our responsibility to determine which  we will work towards making a reality. "
486,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ppNYZq-hYTw,"Some of the world's most recognizable symbols exist to sell products, others to steer traffic or advance political causes. But there's one whose main purpose is to help people. You may know it as the wheelchair symbol, or a sign for people with disabilities, but its formal title as maintained by the ISO is the International Symbol of Access. But despite its familiarity, many people are unclear as to what  the symbol actually means, which has a lot to do with the symbol itself and the way it came about. In 1968, the International Commission on Technology and Accessibility held a design contest. They were looking for a symbol that would be readily identifiable  from a reasonable distance, self-descriptive, simple, practical, and couldn't be confused with existing signage. The winning design,  which didn't have a head, was created by a Danish designer named Susanne Koefed. The addition of a head a year later gave it a more human form, and within ten years, it was endorsed by both the United Nations and the ISO. With minimal cost and minimal fuss, a global icon was born. There have been a few tweaks over the decades. The Graphic Artists Guild added more rounded, human-like features, and in 2012, the Accessible Icon Project produced a more dynamic version. But what does it really represent? What's its purpose? Put simply, it's a sign to identify where there are accessible facilities. The strength of such an internationally recognized image is that wherever you travel, you don't need to speak the language or have in-depth cultural knowledge. If you require an accessible toilet, the sign shows the way. But the confusion comes  from the term accessibility and what that actually means. Many people assume that because the symbol depicts a wheelchair, that accessible facilities are meant only for people who use wheelchairs, or those, at the very least, who have a visible physical condition. But accessibility is a broad concept that applies to many,  many different conditions. That includes people with autism, visual impairments, and autoimmune diseases, like lupus, which can cause  pain and fatigue, along with many other conditions. In fact, the World Health  Organization estimates that there are approximately 1 billion people who experience some form of disability, which means that this group is very likely to include yourself, or a family member, a classmate, a friend, or a work colleague. And people who use wheelchairs only make up about 65 million, or 15% of the total. The vast majority  have non-visible disabilities. Accessible parking spaces, facilities, and entrances are designed with that entire group in mind. So it's easy to see why in recent years people have begun to raise questions about whether the symbol is really appropriate for what it's meant to do. And it's not just about accuracy. It's common for people  to become indignant, sometimes abusive, when they see people without visible disabilities using accessible facilities. The symbol is unfortunately creating widespread issues for the very people and families it's meant to help. The recent redesigns have attempted with some success to acknowledge concerns over the current symbol. But some think that a complete redesign is in order. It's a difficult task, though. How do you replace a symbol that's familiar the world over? And what do you replace it with? "

Yet one of their most famous punishments is not remembered for its outrageous cruelty, but for its disturbing familiarity. Sisyphus was the first king of Ephyra, now known as Corinth. Although a clever ruler who made his city prosperous, he was also a devious tyrant who seduced his niece and killed visitors to show off his power. This violation of the sacred hospitality tradition greatly angered the gods. But Sisyphus may still have avoided punishment if it hadn’t been for his  reckless confidence. The trouble began when Zeus  kidnapped the nymph Aegina, carrying her away in the form  of a massive eagle. Aegina’s father, the river god Asopus,  pursued their trail to Ephyra, where he encountered Sisyphus. In exchange for the god making a spring inside the city, the king told Asopus which way Zeus had taken the girl. When Zeus found out, he was so furious that he ordered Thanatos, or Death, to chain Sisyphus in the underworld so he couldn’t cause any more problems. But Sisyphus lived up to his crafty reputation. As he was about to be imprisoned, the king asked Thanatos to show him  how the chains worked – and quickly bound him instead,  before escaping back among the living. With Thanatos trapped, no one could die,  and the world was thrown into chaos. Things only returned to normal  when the god of war Ares, upset that battles were no longer fun,  freed Thanatos from his chains. Sisyphus knew his reckoning was at hand. But he had another trick up his sleeve. Before dying, he asked his wife Merope to throw his body in the public square, from where it eventually washed up on  the shores of the river Styx. Now back among the dead,  Sisyphus approached Persephone, queen of the Underworld, and complained that his wife had disrespected him by not giving him a proper burial. Persephone granted him permission to go back to the land of living and punish Merope, on the condition that he would return when he was done. Of course, Sisyphus refused to keep his promise, now having twice escaped death by tricking the gods. There wouldn’t be a third time, as the messenger Hermes dragged Sisyphus back to Hades. The king had thought he was  more clever than the gods, but Zeus would have the last laugh. Sisyphus’s punishment was a straightforward task – rolling a massive boulder up a hill. But just as he approached the top, the  rock would roll all the way back down, forcing him to start over …and over, and over, for all eternity. Historians have suggested that the tale  of Sisyphus may stem from ancient myths about the rising and setting sun,  or other natural cycles. But the vivid image of someone condemned  to endlessly repeat a futile task has resonated as an allegory  about the human condition. In his classic essay The Myth of Sisyphus, existentialist philosopher Albert Camus compared the punishment to humanity’s futile search  for meaning and truth in a meaningless and  indifferent universe. Instead of despairing, Camus imagined  Sisyphus defiantly meeting his fate as he walks down the hill to begin  rolling the rock again. And even if the daily  struggles of our lives sometimes seem equally repetitive and absurd, we still give them significance and value by embracing them as our own. "

Prevented the most extreme abuses from happening and stopped Congress from going full Calvinball But those norms are getting chipped away at an alarming rate the Senate filibuster is all but gone debate has sometimes been limited to as few as 90 seconds and Legislators are frequently not given enough time to even read a bill before having to vote on it It's getting pretty shameful out there and the executive branch is even worse The executive branch actually gets to write the rules that govern the FBI Which is the only investigative body that can effectively investigate the executive branch add to that the president's essentially unlimited power of federal pardons and direct control of our nation's intelligence agencies and you can see why Structurally, we have all sorts of rules related problems built into our system Even political parties have this problem. There is no mention of political parties in our Constitution And while there is good evidence suggesting that men the founding fathers didn't want them in our political system We do have them now and they wield tremendous power. Sorry, Hamilton I know you tried the rules governing the internal workings of political parties are wholly written and Enforced by the party itself and the two parties have developed their own sets of rules and dependently This is why you see features like super-delegates in the Democratic Party rules but not so much in the GOP and as you might imagine Allowing these groups to self govern their internal actions has some pretty serious consequences Of course you might reasonably assume that at least when they interact with the rest of the government these groups run into  all of those checks and balances that Keep things from getting out of hand right, and they do Sort of see the rules for how Congress the President and political parties interact when the rest of government comes from the Constitution Or were passed by Congress veto checked by the President and then are enforced by the courts Rules for the courts are mostly defined by the Constitution and previous court rulings and those rules governing the courts are enforced either by Congress through Impeachment or are internally enforced which obviously could have its problems But so far it's worked out pretty well because the courts have historically been a much more distributed and diverse body than Congress So yay that's working. The courts will save us good job boys You framed the heck out of that Constitution way to go except here's the thing in theory Our government is made up of three competing branches which have all sorts of checks and balances against each other That's the way it was designed to be but in practice we don't have three competing branches of government We actually have two competing political parties spread out amongst those branches of government and that makes enforcement of the rules unpredictable and very inconsistent for example it's generally accepted that the high frequency of Investigations into the Clinton presidency was purely a result of partisan politics performed by a GOP held Congress because once President Bush was elected and the White House switched to GOP hands that zeal for investigation suddenly vanished the standards of congressional rule enforcement plummeted and Unfortunately the courts which have often been the final arbiter of rules in our system have become increasingly Partisan as well from elected state judges to the Supreme Court This problem is getting worse not better And this has led us to a reality where when the branches of government are split between parties over enforcement of rules Renders the government unable to act when it needs to and when one party controls all the branches of government Enforcement virtually disappears and that is when the real shenanigans start. So you might hear all of this and ask Why does this matter to you? Well our government system of checks and balances between three co-equal branches is falling apart and that's gonna have some dire Consequences for all of us if we allow our political parties to act entirely in their own best interest We are doomed to an American system where the social norms of good governance no longer exist, though We do live in a majority rule system the checks and the balances built into that system were designed to protect the minority But those checks are dissolving. I don't want to do the slippery slope thing But in a very extreme case We could reach a point where members of the minority party are made targets of the state Now that sort of thing has not happened in America before but it has happened in other countries. It's not science fiction So what can we do about that actually more than you think see politics is a lot like a spectator sport You might not know this but in sports spectators are active participants in the rules writing and enforcement process You want to know why hockey eliminated the two line pass or why basketball adopted the three-point shot or why football? Decided to more tightly enforce existing Rules on illegal hits all of those patches to the rules were not made because the underlying games were broken They were made to make the game better for spectators in democracies We have the built-in ability to make change with our votes, but it doesn't stop there Thankfully we have the ability to apply pressure all year long not just during voting season We have a well-protected set of freedoms that allow us the ability to apply pressure to our rules writers and our enforcers around the clock We can lobby our officials we can protest we can raise awareness of bad and unenforced rules We can do it all by here's the tough part and you've heard me say it before if you want to make the game better You have to be willing to call fouls on your own team And that's really hard to do in an environment as partisan As ours has become I know but if we do that and support the social norms that keep our whole system in check It'll pay great dividends in the long run for everybody. We'll see you next time "
489,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,qMFpOcLroOg,"A hostile artificial intelligence called NIM has taken over the world’s computers. You’re the only person skilled enough to shut it down, and you’ll only have one chance. You’ve broken into NIM’s secret lab, and now you’re floating in a raft on top of 25 stories of electrified water. You’ve rigged up a remote that can lower the water level by ejecting it from grates in the sides of the room. If you can lower the water level to 0, you can hit the manual override, shut NIM off, and save the day. However, the AI knows that you’re here, and it can lower the water level, too, by sucking it through a trapdoor  at the bottom of the lab. If NIM is the one to lower  the water level to 0, you’ll be sucked out of the lab, resulting in a failed mission. Control over water drainage  alternates between you and NIM, and neither can skip a turn. Each of you can lower the water level by exactly 1, 3, or 4 stories at a time. Whoever gets the level exactly to 0 on their turn will win this deadly duel. Note that neither of you can lower  the water below 0; if the water level is at 2, then the only move is to lower the water level 1 story. You know that NIM has already computed all possible outcomes of the contest, and will play in a way that maximizes its chance of success. You go first. How can you survive and shut off the artificial intelligence? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself. Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 You can’t leave anything up to chance - NIM will take any advantage it can get. And you’ll need to have a response  to any possible move it makes. The trick here is to start from where  you want to end and work backwards. You want to be the one to lower  the water level to 0, which means you need the water level  to be at 1, 3, or 4 when control switches to you. If the water level were at 2, your only option would be to lower it 1 story, which would lead to NIM making the winning move. If we color code the water levels, we can see a simple principle at play: there are “losing” levels like 2, where no matter what whoever starts  their turn there does, they’ll lose. And there are winning levels, where whoever starts their turn there can either win or leave their opponent  with a losing level. So not only are 1, 3,  and 4 winning levels, but so are 5 and 6, since you can send your opponent  to 2 from there. What about 7? From 7, all possible moves would  send your opponent to a winning level, making this another losing level. And we can continue up  the lab in this way. If you start your turn 1, 3, or 4 levels above a losing level, then you’re at a winning level. Otherwise, you’re destined to lose. You could continue like this  all the way to level 25. But as a shortcut, you might notice that levels 8 through 11 are colored identically to 1 through 4. Since a level’s color is determined by the levels 1, 3, and 4 stories below it, this means that level 12 will be the same color as level 5, 13 will match 6, 14 will match 7, and so on, In particular, the losing levels  will always be multiple of 7, and two greater than multiples of 7. Now, from your original starting level of 25, you have to make sure your opponent starts on a losing level every single turn— if NIM starts on a winning level even once, it’s game over for you. So your only choice on turn 1 is to lower the water level by 4 stories. No matter what the AI does, you can continue giving it losing levels until you reach 0 and trigger the manual override. And with that, the crisis is averted. Now, back to a less stressful  kind of surfing. "

Located in the present-day country of Zimbabwe, it's the sight of the largest known settlement ruins in Sub-Saharan Africa, second on the continent only to the pyramids of Egypt. But the history of this city is shrouded in controversy, defined by decades of dispute about who built it and why. Its name comes from the Shona word madzimbabwe, meaning big house of stone for its unscalable stone walls that reach heights of nearly ten meters and run for a length of about 250 meters. For its grandeur and historical significance, it was named a UNESCO  World Heritage site in 1986. Back in the 14th and 15th centuries, it was a thriving city. Spread across nearly eight  square-kilometers, Great Zimbabwe was defined by three main areas: the Hill Complex, where the king lived; the Great Enclosure, reserved for members of the royal family; and the Valley Complex,  where regular citizens lived. Rulers were both powerful economic and religious leaders for the region. At its highest point, the city had a bustling urban population  of 18,000 people and was one of the major African  trade centers at the time. What enabled this growth  was Great Zimbabwe's influential role in an intercontinental trade network. Connected to several key city-states along the East African Swahili Coast, it was part of the larger Indian Ocean trade routes. The city generated its riches by controlling the sources and trade of the most prized items: gold, ivory, and copper. With this mercantile power, it was able to extend its sphere of influence across continents, fostering a strong Arab and Indian trader presence throughout its zenith. Archaeologists have since pieced together the details of this history through artifacts discovered on site. There were pottery shards and glassworks from Asia, as well as coins minted in the coastal trading city of Kilwa Kisiwani over 1,500 miles away. They also found soapstone bird figures, which are thought to represent each of the city's rulers, and young calf bones, only unearthed near the royal residence, show how the diet of the elite differed from the general population. These clues have also led to theories about the city's decline. By the mid-15th century, the buildings at Great Zimbabwe were almost all that remained. Archaeological evidence points to overcrowding and sanitation issues as the cause, compounded by soil depletion triggered by overuse. Eventually, as crops withered and conditions in the city worsened, the population of Great Zimbabwe is thought to have dispersed and formed the nearby Mutapa and Torwa states. Centuries later, a new phase of Great Zimbabwe's influence began to play out in the political realm as people debated who had built the famous city of stone. During the European  colonization of Africa, racist colonial officials claimed  the ruins couldn't be of African origin. So, without a detailed written  record on hand, they instead relied on myths to explain the magnificence of Great Zimbabwe. Some claimed it proved the Bible story of the Queen of Sheba who lived in a city of riches. Others argued it was built by the Ancient Greeks. Then, in the early 20th century after extensive excavation at the site, the archaeologist David Randall-MacIver presented clear evidence that Great Zimbabwe was built by indigenous peoples. Yet, at the time, the country's white  minority colonial government sought to discredit this theory because it challenged the legitimacy of their rule. In fact, the government actively encouraged historians to produce accounts that disputed the city's African origins. Over time, however, an overwhelming body of evidence mounted, identifying Great Zimbabwe as an African city built by Africans. During the 1960s and 70s, Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol  for the African Nationalist movement that was spreading across the continent. Today, the ruins at Great Zimbabwe, alluded to on the Zimbabwean flag by a soapstone bird, still stand as a source of national pride and cultural value. "
491,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,r1-OC_4cx_o,"A young girl sits alone,  in a cold room in a great house,  on a German coast and dreams  of being a queen. {Intro} That girl's name  was Sophia. Or Sophie, depending  on who's writing about her. She was born in the spring of 1729. But her mother  would never forgive her for the crime of being a girl. Her mother,  young, ambitious always wanting to be the center of attention was deeply discontent  on her life having been married off at 15,  to a man 21 years her senior. Worse still, that man was poor (at least, by her standards) and stuffy. Her life was nothing like the glittering court  that she'd known as a girl. She still had ambition. She still wanted  to escape her husband's drab military post, to live in high society and see the world, and, to her mind, that required a male heir. And so, poor Sophia was neglected, often told  that she was ugly, yelled at for minor offenses or, simply, left entirely alone. She was bright, and could memorize things with ease. But she frequently infuriated her tutors by asking questions like: ""Why were the great men of antiquity damned just because  they lived before Christ?"" ...or... ""What was the universe like  before creation?"" She found solace only in the lessons  she was taught by one of her governesses who introduced her to French and brought her books  by Racine and Molière. And all the while her mother doted  on her sickly and infirmed brother who'd been born an year and a half after  she'd entered the world ...unwanted. Sophia would always harbor  a resentment over the treatment she received compared  to her brother. But in 1742,  when she was 13 her brother died,  succumbing to scarlet fever. She had one other brother, who would survive their youth but he was  a half decade younger. And so now, at last, her ambitious mother's eye  finally turned to her. But she didn't receive the warmth  and the affection that she had hoped for. Her mother's aim was to see her married. After all,  her mother thought taking her daughter out  in search of a match to travel and get back to court might provide a path  to escape her drab life. Unfortunately, her daughter was proud, impertinent and arrogant. (Or at least, so she felt.) If there was to be any attempt  at matchmaking she was going have to break Sophia  of these habits. And so, Sophia learned to hide her pride to hide her talents and her mother began writing and visiting all of their relatives in search of a match. And she made sure that Sophia knew just what failing to find a match would mean. From time to time she would take Sophia to see spinster relatives locked away in a convent or shut away in a remote wing  of a family house. One of these encounters Sophia  would remember forever. An aunt, who lived in one small room with 16 pug dogs. 16 pugs,  who did everything that dogs do... ...in that one room. The smell would hunt her  for all her days. So she rapidly became enamored  of the idea of marriage. She saw it as a way out, an escape from her mother. But her prospects were limited. Her father was not a man  of great means. And though he was a prince of one of the tiny principalities that then made up the Holy Roman Empire he wasn't even THE prince  of that domain having others in the line  of succession before him. Her mother, on the other hand was of the house Holstein-Gottorp one of the great houses  of the Holy Roman Empire. And though she was from a minor branch she could still reach out  to all her cousins. And so it was, that even before her brother died, on a visit to her uncle, Sophia met the orphaned duke of Holstein: Peter Ulrich, 11 years old at the time. This young man was  the heir to the throne of Sweden and the last surviving grandson  of Peter the Great. He was also sickly though doughy of features and even at the age of 11 given to drink. This meeting would prove  fortuitous in years to come... or disastrous, depending  on how you look at it. But long before that chance encounter was to change her life as she was making the rounds, looking for a suitor attention of this type fell on  her much closer to home. At the age of 14 a 24 year old cuirassier, her cousin, began to... (what was called at the time) ...show his affections. Often finding her in some secluded corner of the house when no one else was around to kiss her. He eventually proposed to her. Although she expertly put him off by agreeing to it only if he could get  the consent of her parents. Then in the middle  of dinner one night a letter came. It was from Russia. From the Russian empress, Elizabeth Elizabeth whose sister had married a Holstein. Elizabeth who was  the aunt of Peter Ulrich. Elizabeth had been betrothed,  at one point, to Sophia's uncle. Elizabeth whose association Sophia's mother  had been very careful to cultivate regularly sending her news  and portraits of her daughter. Elizabeth had recently  become the guardian of young Peter Ulrich adopting him as her own. And as such, young Peter had lost the right to the crown of Sweden BUT had gained  a much greater prize: succession to the crown of Russia. Elizabeth's letter said nothing of it's purpose but simply implored Sophia and her mother to travel at once to Russia. Despite the letter's vagueness the implications were clear. Sophia might yet find  her way to being a queen as she had so often daydreamed. But the night surprises  weren't over yet! Mere hours after  the first letter's arrival a second courier, breathless and panting, burst into the house. He too had a letter... But this one was  from Fredrick the Great summoning to his court in Berlin. Sophia's mother wasted  no time starting to pack. The invitation to Russia had come with a bank note for 10,000 rubles  to equip them for their journey. This, of course, went not to making sure  that Sophia looked like a bride that they had both hoped she would be but instead went towards outfitting her mother with a splendid array of court dresses. And so, they began their journey. First to Berlin... ...and then to Moscow. When they arrived at Berlin Sophia's mother raced  to present herself to Frederick. But, to her shock he simply asked  where her daughter was. She hadn't taken Sophia with her to court thinking that the king couldn't possibly want to talk to the girl  more than to her incredible self. So she said  that Sophia was sick. The next day too she showed up at court alone and again Frederick asked  where Sophia was. And again, her mother said  that she was sick. On the third day Frederick pressed the issue and Sophia's mother said that she couldn't come because  she had nothing to wear. At which juncture a somewhat miffed Frederick the Great cut her off and asked one of his sisters to ""just lend the poor girl a dress ...please"". Finally, Sophia appeared before the king in an ill-fitting dress, without jewels or finery. She was shy, worried about what this great man might think. But to her surprise (and, undoubtedly, the surprise of her mother) she was seated at dinner that night right next to the king. Her mother wasn't even seated at the same table! The king tried make her feel comfortable speaking to her of poetry and of the opera, plays and ballet. And though everyone stared at the king talking to a child he continued on and she opened up speaking to him throughout the meal. By the end, he saw in her, hidden just below that layer of humility, an intelligence and a perception. He wrote to Elizabeth of Russia to say as much. He had been assessing her. Because in his bid to make Prussia a player in the world stage he had already created many enemies. And he knew that he would have to have Russia on his side. It was his hope that this German princess could help ensure that. But his business  was not just with Sophia. In private his agents  asked her mother to be their agent in the Russian court. They explained how  one Count Bestuzhev was the sworn enemy  of Prussia and that he would stop  Sophia's marriage if he could. So Sophia's mother, Johanna,  should do everything on her power to make him lose favor. Never again would  these two rulers meet in person. These rulers  whom history titles ""The Great"". But it's far from the last time that their paths will cross. Join us next time as Sophia finally makes her way to Russia and her mother sets about trying to destroy Count Bestuzhev. "
492,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,rD5goS69LT4,"There's a play so powerful  that an old superstition says its name should never  even be uttered in a theater, a play that begins with witchcraft and ends with a bloody severed head, a play filled with riddles, prophesies, nightmare visions, and lots of brutal murder, a play by William Shakespeare sometimes referred to as the ""Scottish Play"" or the ""Tragedy of Macbeth."" First performed at the Globe Theater in London in 1606, ""Macbeth"" is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy. It is also one of his most action-packed. In five acts, he recounts a story of a Scottish nobleman who steals the throne, presides over a reign of terror, and then meets a bloody end. Along the way, it asks important questions about ambition, power, and violence that spoke directly to the politics of Shakespeare's time and continue to echo in our own. England in the early 17th century was politically precarious. Queen Elizabeth I died in 1603 without producing an heir, and in a surprise move, her advisors passed the crown to James Stewart, King of Scotland. Two years later, James was subject to an assassination attempt called the Gunpowder Plot. Questions of what made for a legitimate king were on everyone's lips. So Shakespeare must have known he had potent material when he conflated and adapted the stories of a murderous 11th century  Scottish King named Macbeth and those of several other Scottish nobles. He found their annals in Hollinshed's ""Chronicles,"" a popular 16th century history of Britain and Ireland. Shakespeare would also have known he needed to tell his story in a way that would  immediately grab the attention of his diverse and rowdy audience. The Globe welcomed  all sections of society. Wealthier patrons watched the stage from covered balconies while poorer people paid a penny to take in the show from an open-air section called the pit. Talking, jeering, and cheering was common during performances. There are even accounts of audiences throwing furniture when plays were flops. So ""Macbeth"" opens with a literal bang. Thunder cracks and three witches appear. They announce they're searching for a Scottish nobleman and war hero named Macbeth, then fly off while chanting a curse that predicts a world gone mad. ""Fair is foul and foul is fair. Hover through the fog and filthy air."" As seen later, they find Macbeth and his fellow nobleman Banquo. ""All hail Macbeth,"" they prophesize, ""that shalt be king hereafter!"" ""King?"" Macbeth wonders. Just what would he have to do  to gain the crown? Macbeth and his wife Lady Macbeth soon chart a course of murder, lies, and betrayal. In the ensuing bloodbath, Shakespeare provides viewers with some of the most memorable passages in English literature. ""Out, damned spot! Out, I say!"" Lady Macbeth cries when she believes she can't wipe her victim's blood off her hands. Her obsession with guilt is one of many themes that runs through the play, along with the universal tendency to abuse power, the endless cycles of violence  and betrayal, the defying political conflict. As is typical with Shakespeare's language, a number of phrases  that got their start in the play have been repeated so many times that they now feel commonplace. They include ""the milk of human kindness,"" ""what's done is done,"" and the famous witches' spell, ""Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn, and caldron bubble."" But Shakespeare saves the juiciest bit of all for Macbeth himself. Towards the end of the play, Macbeth reflects on the universality of death and the futility of life. ""Out, out, brief candle!"" he laments. ""Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts  and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more. It is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury signifying nothing."" Life may be a tale told my an idiot, but ""Macbeth"" is not. Shakespeare's language and characters have entered our cultural consciousness to a rare extent. Directors often use the story to shed light on abuses of power, ranging from the American mafia to dictators across the globe. The play has been adapted  to film many times, including Akira Kurosawa's ""Throne of Blood,"" which takes place in feudal Japan, and a modernized version called ""Scotland, PA,"" in which Macbeth and his rivals are managers of competing  fast food restaurants. No matter the presentation, questions of morality, politics, and power are still relevant today, and so, it seems,  is Shakespeare's ""Macbeth."" "
493,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,rLsimrBoYXc,"You're lifting weights. The first time feels easy, but each lift takes more and more effort  until you can’t continue. Inside your arms, the muscles responsible for the lifting have become unable to contract. Why do our muscles get fatigued? We often blame lactic acid  or running out of energy, but these factors alone don’t account  for muscle fatigue. There’s another major contributor: the muscle’s ability to respond to signals from the brain. To understand the roots of muscle fatigue, it helps to know how a muscle contracts  in response to a signal from a nerve. These signals travel from the brain to the muscles in a fraction of a second via long, thin cells called motor neurons. The motor neuron and the muscle cell are separated by a tiny gap, and the exchange of particles across this gap enables the contraction. On one side of the gap, the motor neuron contains a  neurotransmitter called acetylcholine. On the other side, charged particles, or ions, line the muscle cell’s membrane: potassium on the inside,  and sodium on the outside. In response to a signal from the brain, the motor neuron releases acetylcholine, which triggers pores on the muscle  cell membrane to open. Sodium flows in, and potassium flows out. The flux of these charged particles is a crucial step for muscle contraction: the change in charge creates an electrical signal called an action potential that spreads through the muscle cell, stimulating the release of calcium that’s stored inside it. This flood of calcium causes  the muscle to contract by enabling proteins buried in the muscle  fibers to lock together and ratchet towards each other, pulling the muscle tight. The energy used to power the contraction comes from a molecule called ATP. ATP also helps pump the ions back  across the membrane afterward, resetting the balance of sodium  and potassium on either side. This whole process repeats  every time a muscle contracts. With each contraction, energy in the form of ATP gets used up, waste products like lactic  acid are generated, and some ions drift away from the muscle’s cell membrane, leaving a smaller and smaller group behind. Though muscle cells use up ATP as they contract repeatedly, they are always making more, so most of the time even heavily fatigued muscles still  have not depleted this energy source. And though many waste products are acidic, fatigued muscles still maintain pH within normal limits, indicating that the tissue is effectively clearing these wastes. But eventually, over the course of  repeated contractions there may not be sufficient concentrations of potassium, sodium or calcium ions immediately available near  the muscle cell membrane to reset the system properly. So even if the brain sends a signal, the muscle cell can’t generate the action potential necessary to contract. Even when ions like sodium,  potassium or calcium are depleted in or around the muscle cell, these ions are plentiful elsewhere in the body. With a little time, they will flow back to the areas where they’re needed, sometimes with the help of active sodium and potassium pumps. So if you pause and rest, muscle fatigue will subside as these ions replenish throughout the muscle. The more regularly you exercise, the longer it takes for muscle fatigue to set in each time. That’s because the stronger you are, the fewer times this cycle of nerve signal from the brain to contraction in the muscle has to be repeated to lift a certain amount of weight. Fewer cycles means slower ion depletion, so as your physical fitness improves, you can exercise for longer at the same intensity. Many muscles grow with exercise, and larger muscles also have bigger stores of ATP and a higher capacity to clear waste, pushing fatigue even  farther into the future. "
494,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,rjibeBSnpJ0,"In the mid-16th century, Italians were captivated by a type  of male singer whose incredible range contained notes previously thought impossible for adult men. However, this gift came at a high price. To prevent their voices from breaking, these singers had been castrated before puberty, halting the hormonal processes that would deepen their voices. Known as castrati, their light, angelic voices were renowned throughout Europe, until the cruel procedure that created them was outlawed in the 1800s. Though stunting vocal growth can produce an extraordinary musical range, naturally developing voices are already capable of incredible variety. And as we age, our bodies undergo two major changes which explore that range. So how exactly does our voice box work, and what causes these shifts in speech? The specific sound of a speaking voice is the result of many anatomical variables, but it’s mostly determined by the age and health of our vocal cords and the size of our larynxes. The larynx is a complex system  of muscle and cartilage that supports and moves the vocal cords, or, as they’re more accurately known, the vocal folds. Strung between the thyroid  and arytenoid cartilages, these two muscles form an elastic curtain that opens and shuts across the trachea, the tube that carries air through the throat. The folds are apart when we’re breathing, but when we speak, they slam shut. Our lungs push air  against the closed folds, blowing them open and vibrating the tissue to produce sound. Unlike the deliberate focus required  for playing an external instrument, we effortlessly change notes as we speak. By pushing air faster or slower, we change the frequency and amplitude  of these vibrations, which respectively translate to the pitch  and volume of our voices. Rapid and small vibrations create  high-pitched, quiet tones, while slow, large vibrations  produce deep, bellowing rumbles. Finally, by moving the laryngeal muscles  between the cartilages, we can stretch and contract those folds to intuitively play our internal instruments. This process is the same from your first words to your last, but as you age, your larynx ages too. During puberty,  the first major shift starts, as your voice begins to deepen. This happens when  your larynx grows in size, elongating the vocal folds and opening up more room for them to vibrate. These longer folds have slower, larger vibrations, which result in a lower baseline pitch. This growth is especially dramatic in many males, whose high testosterone levels lead first to voice cracks, and then to deeper, more booming voices, and laryngeal protrusions  called Adam’s apples. Another vocal development during puberty occurs when the homogenous tissue covering the folds specializes into three distinct  functional layers: a central muscle, a layer of stiff collagen wrapped  in stretchy elastin fibers, and an outer layer of mucus membrane. These layers add nuance and depth to the voice, giving it a distinct timbre that sets it apart from its pre-pubescent tones. After puberty, most people’s voices remain more or less the same for about 50 years. But we all use our voices differently, and eventually we experience the symptoms associated with aging larynxes, known as presbyphonia. First, the collagen in our folds stiffens and the surrounding elastin fibers  atrophy and decay. This decreased flexibility increases  the pitch of older voices. But for people who have experienced  the hormonal effects of menopause, the higher pitch is countered and outweighed by swollen vocal folds. The folds' increased mass slows their vibrations, resulting in deeper voices. All these symptoms are further complicated by having fewer healthy laryngeal nerve endings, which reduces precise muscle control and causes breathy or rough voices. Ultimately, these anatomical changes are just a few of the factors that can affect your voice.

They're cute, they're lovable, and judging by the 26 billions views of over 2 million YouTube videos of them pouncing, bouncing, climbing, cramming, stalking, clawing, chattering, and purring, one thing is certain: cats are very entertaining. These somewhat strange feline behaviors, both amusing and baffling, leave many of us asking, ""Why do cats do that?"" Throughout time, cats were simultaneously solitary predators of smaller animals and prey for larger carnivores. As both predator and prey, survival of their species depended on crucial instinctual behaviors which we still observe in wild  and domestic cats today. While the feline actions of your house cat Grizmo might seem perplexing, in the wild, these same behaviors, naturally bred into cats for millions of years, would make Grizmo a super cat. Enabled by their unique muscular structure and keen balancing abilities, cats climbed to high vantage points to survey their territory and spot prey in the wild. Grizmo doesn't need these particular skills to find and hunt down dinner in her food bowl today, but instinctually, viewing the living room from the top of the bookcase is exactly what she has evolved to do. As wild predators, cats are opportunistic and hunt whenever prey is available. Since most cat prey are small, cats in the wild needed to eat  many times each day, and use a stalk, pounce, kill, eat strategy to stay fed. This is why Grizmo prefers to chase and pounce on little toys and eat small meals over the course of the day and night. Also, small prey tend to hide in tiny spaces in their natural environments, so one explanation for Grizmo's propensity to reach into containers and openings is that she is compelled by  the same curiosity that helped ensure the continuation of her species for millions of years before. In the wild, cats needed sharp claws for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Sharpening their claws on nearby surfaces kept them conditioned and ready, helped stretch their back and leg muscles, and relieve some stress, too. So, it's not that Grizmo hates your couch, chair, ottoman, pillows, curtains, and everything else  you put in her environment. She's ripping these things to shreds and keeping her claws in tip-top shape because this is exactly what her ancestors did in order to survive. As animals that were preyed upon, cats evolved to not get caught, and in the wild, the cats that were  the best at avoiding predators thrived. So at your house today, Grizmo is an expert  at squeezing into small spaces and seeking out and hiding in unconventional spots. It also explains why she prefers a clean and odor-free litter box. That's less likely to give away  her location to any predators that may be sniffing around nearby. Considering everything we do know about cats, it seems that one of their most  predominate behaviors is still one of the most mysterious. Cats may purr for any number of reasons, such as happiness, stress, and hunger. But curiously, the frequency of their purrs, between 25 and 150 hertz, is within a range that can promote tissue regeneration. So while her purring makes Grizmo an excellent nap companion, it is also possible that her purr is healing her muscles and bones, and maybe even yours, too. They developed through time as both solitary predators  that hunted and killed to eat, and stealthy prey that hid and escaped to survive. So cats today retain many of the same instincts that allowed them to thrive in the wild for millions of years. This explains some of their seemingly strange behaviors. To them, our homes are their jungles. But if this is the case, in our own cat's eyes, who are we? Big, dumb, hairless cats competing with them for resources? Terribly stupid predators they're able to outsmart every day? Or maybe they think we're the prey. "
496,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,sITpTx5GL-w," There was one thing, more than any other, that bothered Einstein about quantum physics, It was a phenomena he would dub: *clap clap* ""Spooky Action at a Distance™"". *evil laughter* [Birth Of The People] by Demetori *coughs* Oo, sorry about that. *clap clap*  Alright. So, what is this ""Spooky Action at a Distance™"" that so worried Einstein and why is it important to quantum computing? Well, it's this strange phenomena where, in certain sets of particles, when you do something to one of them, the rest are instantly affected. It's what we know today as, Quantum Entanglement. And it'll be at the heart of how a quantum computer functions. The idea is this: when two particles are entangled, you have to see them as not two particles, but as one complete system. And anything you know about the complete system has to be true when you look at the component parts. So, let's say you've got a pair of entangled particles and you know the spin of these particles adds up to zero. Now, let's say you mess with one of those particles and increase its spin a bit. The other particle's spin will instantly change to correct, to keep the whole system at a spin of zero. This happens no matter how far away those two particles are: they could be in the same room or... they could be across the galaxy. This is what Einstein meant by ""Spooky Action at a Distance"". and this bothered Einstein, because a lot of his work was related to signal transmission. In an era, when we were finding dozens of new ways to communicate and when precise synchronized measurements of time were vital for everything, from running trains to managing modern navies, this patent clerk spent many a day pondering, abstract ways of transmitting signals. And to him, the fastest thing was light. Nothing could move faster than light. So the fastest you could ever transmit a signal from one body to another was the speed at which light moved. But consider our two particles a galaxy apart: we nudge one of them in our lab here on Earth and the other one instantly shifts. Instantly! It shifts faster than light could have possibly gotten to it. This breaks down causality. No physical chain of events could have caused the second particle to shift, because no signal could have been transmitted to it that fast. From the perspective of anything like classical physics, this is magic. In fact, it calls all of classical physics into question, as it did in Einstein's mind. When we think of the world classically we think of chains of events; we think of action and reaction, cause and effect. But what if there's no physical way to link something's cause and the effect? What if there's no chain of actions between the cause and effect? What if there's no temporal difference between the cause and the effect? Can you even say something is caused by something that happened, at the same time as the thing you're suggesting caused it? If you find these questions troubling, you're not alone. Many physicists continue to be troubled by them today. But for the most part, we've come to accept that the phenomena of quantum entanglement is real. And instead of fighting it, we have begun to ask questions about how we might make use of this ""Spooky Action™"", that's so concerned Einstein. And there are many potential applications. China just sent up satellites that use pairs of entangled particles as encryption keys. And people are experimenting with the possibility of using this principle to send information instantaneously, rather than be constrained by the speed of light. But for our purposes, we're interested in quantum computing and the idea of the ""Qubit™"" Now, ""Qubits™"" or ""Quantum Bits™"", if you'd like to get fancy, are incredibly complicated and we're not going to do them justice here at all. But the basic idea is simple, in classical computing, everything is represented by a 0 or a 1. Each bit of information is just that, either a yes or a no answer to a question. So, for example, in the classical computing world, if you're trying to figure out if John Doe is staying at a hotel, you'd have to check his name against each entry in the register. The computer would check the first entry, saying: ""Does this name match 'John Doe'? Y/N,"" and if the answer is no, it would move on to the next name and do the operation again. But ""Qubits™"" function differently. And again, this is a super-loose, 101 definition but remember how, with the double-slit experiment, we showed that quantum states can be viewed as a wave of possibilities. And that these waves can combine and interfere with each other to create another wave. Well, that last wave, the combined wave, is called a quantum superposition, because basically it's the sum of other waves. And ""Quantum Bits™"" can take advantage of this. They can basically function as the superposition of both a classical 0 and a 1. And that already makes them more efficient, in some ways, than a classical bit. But the real trick, comes from when we add entanglement. As we entangle more and more bits together, turning them into a combined system, we effectively, at least for algorithms that can take advantage of this style of computing, get an exponential increase in processing power. This potential exponential growth is why you'll often hear people throw around numbers like ""a hundred ""Qubits™"" as the goal for quantum computing. At the time, this was recorded, the largest number of successfully entangled ""Qubits™"" we've been able to perform operations with is 20. But, with each ""Qubit™"" we managed to add to that matrix of entangled ""Qubits™"", we get an exponential jump in calculation. So if we could... ever reach something like a hundred, a somewhat arbitrary number, admittedly, the resulting machine would be enormously powerful. So, why haven't we managed it yet? Why is achieving this so hard? Why are we counting the steps forward in terms of single bits? Because of a phenomena called, ""Quantum Decoherence™"" A phenomena we'll get into next time. That is, of course, if the zeros and ones of current computing will still let us. Are we cool? Awesome. Knew I could ""COUNT"" on you. See what I did there? Sorry, won't hap""PUN"" again.

497,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,sLMc5OFnQRs,"It's estimated that  for every 10,000 bills in the U.S., one of those bills is fake. That may not sound like much, but it adds up to millions of dollars in cold hard cash. Counterfeit money has the potential to cause all sorts of problems, from leaving you short $20 to destabilizing national economies. But don't worry. You can help catch the counterfeits. All you need are some simple tools and a bit of chemistry. First up, the anti-counterfeit  detection pen. The pen looks like a highlighter and contains a solution  of potassium iodide and elemental iodine. It reveals of the presence of starch, which is commonly used  to strengthen regular printer paper, but won't be found in real money. That's because authentic bills are made of cotton and linen and are threaded with tiny  red and blue fibers. That material is made by a single, highly-guarded company called Crane and Company, which has been printing currency since Paul Revere asked them  to help finance the Revolutionary War. The starch in many counterfeit bills, on the other hand, is made of two molecules: amylopectin and amylose. It's amylose that gives the fake away. Its long chain of sugar molecules connected by oxygen atoms forms a helical structure, like DNA. Iodide likes to squeeze inside this coil, forming a new compound that leaves a dark mark on the paper. However, in the absence of starch, there is no chemical reaction and the mark will look light yellow. So if the fake isn't printed  on starchy paper, iodine solutions can't help you. That's one of the reasons  U.S. bills printed since 1996 have been chemically enhanced to include another counterfeit countermeasure: a strip that fluoresces under UV light. That's the same kind of light used at black light parties and airport security lines. The polyester strip printed with invisble ink is just one millimeter wide and is found in different positions depending on a bill's value. If you hold your dollar  up to natural light, you can see the amount and the word USA printed on the band. But under UV light, these strips really shine. They contain molecules that can be excited by absorbing certain amounts of energy, specifically, that given off by common UV light sources. As these excited molecules return to their original states, they lose a bit of energy as heat and then radiate the rest as light. Energy is inversely related to wavelength, which means that the longer wavelengths have lower energy. So the lower energy light  given off by the strip means longer wavelengths that fall in the visible range, and suddenly we can see that which had been invisible. And if a glowing strip doesn't show up on a recent bill, you have a fake on your hands. For times when you're not dealing  with counterfeit masterminds, looking for simple visual cues will do. Make sure the portrait looks lifelike and not flat, the seal has perfectly  even sawtooth points, the inked border is unbroken, and the serial number has precisely equal spacing between each number. So the next time you come across some dubious dough, have a closer look, pull out your iodine solution, or take it to a rave and you just might catch a counterfeit. "
498,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,sLXLlJ7FhJU,"Games are illusions. a big ol pile of smoke and mirrors. and sometimes... In an attempt to make the player feel something real through a virtual experience Designers have to get a little sneaky. ♪♪♪ In order to discuss the way that game designers sometimes hide mechanics from their players to improve the play experience, We have invited game designer and cool person, Jennifer Scheurle to help us write this. Here we go! When we think about design in other disciplines, We can usually tell the parameters they're working within. and those parameters are defined by who they're designing for, and what product or service they need to create. Furniture designers design for the human body and human needs. Their work has a very specific purpose and is mostly informed by how human bodies function. To make a chair, for example, the designer has to consider the human physique, how high up and wide should the seat be? How should the chairs back be shaped for maximum comfort? The design of everyday things like this is so deeply ingrained in our cultures and our societies that we only really notice them when the design is bad. Have you ever instinctively pushed on a door with a horizontal bar like this only to find that you're actually supposed to pull it open? That right there, is some bad design. we actually did a whole episode on stuff like that. I'll put a link to it at the end of the video. Game designers have to work within these parameters as well. However, unlike the chair designer, who has to design for the needs and comforts of the human body, game designers essentially design for the human mind and perception. Now, these are fields which even science does not fully understand yet. but we do know one thing above all about the human psyche. That it is deeply, and beautifully, flawed. and for game designers that means that we are designing for a system that is likely to lie to itself. To skew reality. a system that is utterly horrible at judging things like chance or self-awareness I will give you an example. Let's say I designed for you a game with a combat mechanic where your ability to hit enemies is determined by a percentage chance. Let's say that the game tells you that your attacks have a 50% chance of hitting your target at each time. and so you think, Okay! I have a 50% chance of hitting the target! Cool! but if the game was actually giving you a 50% chance of hitting, it would feel wrong. See, the human psyche is baaaaaad at judging chance. and so it expects a 50% chance of success to mean that attacks will succeed roughly every second attempt. but that's not how chance works. In reality, a 50% chance of success could lead to four consecutive hits, or seven consecutive misses. But a game designer knows that missing a 50% chance twice or more in a row Just feels wrong and bad. when XCOM tells us that a shot has a 95 percent chance of success and we miss, that feels wrong. because our brain interpreted that as guaranteed success, even though that 5% chance of failure is real and sometimes you just happen to roll a 1. And so the game designers job is to design experiences in a way that accommodate and manipulate these quirks in the human psyche, in order to give the player a better experience. Have you ever played through a combat situation in a game that just felt amazing? because it looked like you just barely got out of there by the skin of your teeth with a shred of health and almost no ammo left. like you somehow managed to overcome the odds and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, And you get this huge adrenaline rush. I am sorry to report, it is very very likely that the game's designers implemented hidden mechanics to create exactly that kind of scenario for you. See, one of the most common examples of hidden game mechanics are instances designs to give you a feeling of tension and empowerment and that can come in many forms. Maybe that very last bit of your health bar secretly represents something like a quarter of your actual hit points. Maybe your last few remaining rounds of ammo secretly deal way more damage. Maybe, when you take that first fatal hit, instead of killing you, the game leaves you with one hit point and makes you immune to damage for a couple of seconds, just to give you a chance to bounce back. All of these hidden mechanics play with our perception. They take our expectations, our understanding of how the game works and subvert them tricking us, in order to give us a better experience many health and damage balanced systems are deliberately designed to put you in a situation where you lose health quickly to make fights feel overwhelming, just so they can start kicking in hidden game mechanics when your health is low to help you overcome the challenge anyway, it makes those battles feel awesome And it creates these exhilarating moments of triumph that can really support a games core empowerment aesthetic. and there are many other types of hidden game mechanics that allow designers to play with our perceptions. To make us feel relaxed or engaged. some games like Bioshock make it so that enemies always miss you the first time they shoot at you, Which ensures that you don't feel unfairly ambushed while you're still trying to orientate yourself in an environment. other games like shadow of mordor slowly give the player health back over time to artificially extend fights for the sake of spectacle. One of the most common hidden game mechanics is something we call Coyote Time. which gives players a slightly longer window where they're allowed to jump after stepping off a ledge. you will be hard-pressed to find a good platformer that doesn't apply coyote time. it really helps to maintain a platformers flow and fast pace. Or if you want a really extreme example of hidden mechanics, there was this racing game back in 1995 called High Octane. it had a bunch of different vehicles And they were all displayed with a list of different stats. under the hood, every single one of those vehicles behaved exactly the same. There was no difference at all. But!! no one noticed. because seeing that list of stats made the vehicles feel different enough that players still debated over which vehicles was the best. Like I said before, video games are all smoke and mirrors. All designs to manipulate human perception. They trick us into being immersed in fantastical worlds, believing that the characters in our adventuring party have emotions They trick us into believing that we've overcome impossible odds all on our own. Or that we've significantly influenced the outcome of a story event. Or that we've even surpassed our expected limitations in ways that the game's designers didn't even anticipate. But those experiences are carefully orchestrated The designers are laying out dots in specific ways knowing that our psyche will be eager to connect them. Our brains are hard-wired to seek enjoyment, stimulation, and praise. it releases all of those feel-good chemicals, that leaves us in a state of joy that all players of all backgrounds and ages know in one shape or form in the of all backgrounds and ages know in one shape or form. in the end, a game designers priority is to engage and entertain. to sometimes lead players down paths that they didn't even know they wanted. Human perception is flawed, and whether we players realize it or not, we want to be fooled. Designers hide implicit rules under the explicit ones because game design has always been the art of Illusion. And at the end of the day, everybody likes a good magic trick. See you next year! ♪♪♪ "
499,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,sQpGT1BgdX4,"Off the rugged coast  of the pacific northwest, pods of killer whales inhabit the frigid waters. Each family is able to survive here thanks mainly to one member, its most knowledgeable hunter: the grandmother. These matriarchs can live eighty years  or more, while most males die off in their thirties. Though killer whales inhabit  every major ocean, until recently we knew  very little about them. The details of their lives eluded scientists until an organization called  the Center for Whale Research began studying a single population near Washington State and British Columbia in 1976. Thanks to their ongoing work, we’ve learned a great deal  about these whales, known as the Southern Residents. And the more we learn, the more this population’s elders’ vital role comes into focus. Each grandmother starts her life as a calf born into her mother’s family group,  or matriline. The family does everything together, hunting and playing, even communicating through their own unique set of calls. Both sons and daughters spend their entire lives with their mothers’ families. That doesn’t mean a young whale  only interacts with her relatives. Besides their own special calls, her matriline shares a dialect with nearby families, and they socialize regularly. Once a female reaches age fifteen or so, these meetings become opportunities to mate with males from other groups. The relationships don’t go much beyond mating— she and her calves stay with her family, while the male returns to his own mother. Until approximately age forty, she gives birth every 6 years on average. Then, she goes through menopause— which is almost unheard of  in the animal kingdom. In fact, humans, killer whales and  a few other whales are the only species whose females  continue to live for years after they stop reproducing. After menopause, grandmothers take the lead hunting for salmon, the Southern Residents’ main food source. Most of the winter they forage offshore, supplementing salmon with other fish. But when the salmon head  towards shore in droves to spawn, the killer whales follow. The matriarch shows the younger whales where to find the most fertile  fishing grounds. She also shares up to 90% of the salmon she catches. With each passing year, her contributions become more vital: overfishing and habitat destruction have decimated salmon populations, putting the whales at near-constant risk of starvation. These grandmothers’ expertise can mean the difference between  life and death for their families– but why do they stop having calves? It’s almost always advantageous for a female to continue reproducing, even if she also cares for her existing children and grandchildren. A couple unique circumstances change this equation for killer whales. The fact that neither sons or daughters leave their families of origin  is extremely rare— in almost all animal species, one or both sexes disperse. This means that as a female  killer whale ages, a greater percentage of her family consists of her children  and grandchildren, while more distant relatives die off. Because older females are more closely related to the group than younger females, they do best to invest in the family as a whole, whereas younger females should  invest in reproducing. In the killer whale’s environment, every new calf is another mouth to feed on limited, shared resources. An older female can further her genes without burdening her family by supporting her adult sons, who sire calves other families will raise. This might be why the females have evolved to stop reproducing entirely in middle age. Even with the grandmothers’ contributions, the Southern Resident killer whales  are critically endangered, largely due to a decline in salmon. We urgently need to invest in restoring salmon populations to save them from extinction. In the long term, we’ll need more studies  like the Center for Whale Research’s. What we’ve learned about  the Southern Residents may not hold true for other groups. By studying other populations closely, we might uncover more  startling adaptations, and anticipate their vulnerabilities  to human interference before their survival is at risk. "
500,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,sZ2b9ys7ALI,"The rich squatters were in an uproar, horses and cattle vanished like water through a sieve. It was the Greta Mob's doing, a flashy young gang of thieves who had suddenly become organized. Unstoppable, under the leadership of a 22 year old named Ned Kelly. The police knew it was him, but they couldn't catch him. No matter how preposterous the number of livestock he sold, he always had a legal bill of sale for them. In desperation, the superintendent of police issued a formal directive: Officers must arrest the members of the Greta Mob on any charge, no matter how small, and send them to prison with all the force of the law. That's a very good way of taking the flashness out of them. ♪ Ned Kelly certainly had flash. The squatters might have hated him, but the poor farmers who had suffered under their abuse for decades, celebrated Ned everywhere he went. There was always somebody eager to buy him a drink when he came to town, and Ned's ill-gotten gains would often go to buy a round for the whole bar, so that everybody could celebrate squatter riches turning into drinks. But Ned himself wouldn't indulge. He'd never forgotten the final year of his father's life. He had never forgot watching the man he so admired waste away in a drunken haze. So Ned never got drunk. That is until one evening, in September of 1877, Ned had stopped in for drinks at the local hotel, and happened to sit next to a young officer named Alexander Fitzpatrick. A fellow Irishman about Ned's age, Fitzpatrick had only recently joined the police, and still had a bit of that scoundrel quality that Ned could not help but like. They bought each other drinks, toasted to each other's health, and the next morning, Ned awoke in a haze with a splitting hangover... in a prison cell. Fitzpatrick had arrested him outside the bar on charge of public drunkenness. Ned could not believe it. He wasn't a drinker, but he was no lightweight, either. It would take more than a beer or two to black him out. Unless... ...someone had drugged him, and Fitzpatrick looked awfully nervous. The young officer had set him up, Ned was sure of it. No doubt Fitzpatrick sought praise for being the man to finally bring in Ned Kelly, for finally taking the flashness out of him. Well, Ned was not going to let Fitzpatrick have that victory. Tearing away from the handcuff Fitzpatrick tried to put on him, Ned charges into the street. Four police officers run after him, yelling for passers-by to seize him. Nobody dares, but one brave soul manages to trip Ned, and sends him careening into a nearby shop. The officers run after him, and even shop keep joins the fray. All five jump at him. One officer, desperately trying to get a grip on Ned, accidentally catches the hem of his pants and pulled them down. Another one sees this and thinks: ""Hmm..."" ""I know what kind of pain would stop any full-grown man in his tracks"". And that is when things really get... eh, well...nuts. Because pain does not stop Ned Kelly. No no no... Ned roars in fury, and throws the officers off him like broken toys. He kicks Fitzpatrick so hard, that the young policeman flies into a wall and is knocked unconscious. But the officer who grabbed Ned Kelly's nethers continues to hold on for dear life. The local magistrate, hearing all of this noise, comes in to investigate. And when he sees what is going on, he immediately yells at the officers: ""YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES!!!"" They drop off Ned, and he gets to pull his pants up. Feeling vindicated, Ned limping more than a little at this point, tamely agrees to let the magistrate take charge from here. He allows the magistrate to handcuff him. He goes to his court appointment, gentle as a lamb, and pleads guilty to all charges. He pays his fines on the spot, and walks away a legend. As for Fitzpatrick, he was left nursing a headache, and a grudge. Since he couldn't really strike at Ned, Fitzpatrick instead took aim at Ned's younger brother: Dan Kelly. Dan was only 16, but he'd been running with his big brother's Greta Mob since the beginning. The police had finally tracked one of the illegal horse sales back to Dan, and put a warrant out for his arrest. Fitzpatrick decided that he was going to be the man to bring Dan in. So he rode 17 miles out of his way, threw down a few beers to boost his courage, and showed up late one afternoon on the Kelly's doorstep. Ellen Kelly, Ned's mother, wanted none of it. She had watched her siblings, her in-laws, her husband, and now her children dragged before a prejudice court. And she still carried a grudge over Ned getting three years in prison for riding a horse that he hadn't even stolen. She demanded to see a warrant, Fitzpatrick didn't have it with him. So she told him to get the hell out of her house. Fitzpatrick would later claim that she came after him with a shovel. The Kelly family insisted that he started it by pulling his gun on her. Either way, things got heated up fast. Dan leaped for the gun, twisting it out of Fitzpatrick's grasp. At the same moment, Ned drew his own pistol and fired three warning shots above the police officer's head. But Fitzpatrick flailed when Dan came after him, and one bullet grazed his wrist. The shock hit all of them at once. Ned hurried to make amends, sitting Fitzpatrick down at the table helping him dig out the bullet with a small knife. Ellen Kelly bandaged the wound, and Dan gave back his gun. Shaken, and not a little scared for his life, Fitzpatrick agreed that it had all been a misunderstanding. He promised not to say a word about what happened, went back to his horse, and rode away. Hours later, in the dead of night, a drunk and disorderly Fitzpatrick barged into the house of a fellow officer and announced: ""I've been shot at by Ned Kelly."" Word spreads like wildfire. At long last, the police had a solid claim against Ned Kelly: Attempted murder. They rode like the wind, but Ned and Dan had already been warned. They disappeared into the bush, that great Australian wilderness that lay just on the outskirts of colonial settlements. But their mother hadn't gone anywhere, and after all, she had swung a shovel at a police officer. The police arrested Ellen Kelly with a two month old baby in her arms, and dragged her off to prison. When they found out, Ned and Dan grew frantic. They had to remain in hiding, but friends in town helped them hire a lawyer and organize their mother's defense. Alas, it was no good. The court sentenced her to three years hard labor. Ned and Dan sent a message offering to give themselves up in exchange for her freedom, but the court would promise no such thing. And why would they? The police had organized search parties to find the missing Kelly brothers. It would only be a mater of time before they caught them. Then all of these criminals would be in jail, and the Greta Mob that had so terrorized the region would be leaderless and broken. The first search party embarked with high spirits, full of bravado. They bragged about how they would gun Ned Kelly down on sight, joked loudly about who would get first blood on him. They might not have been so bold if they had realized that Ned Kelly had tracked them to their camp. Ned knew that they wanted to kill him, and he knew that his situation was desperate. His closest friends from the Greta Mob had joined him in the bush, but they only had two guns between the four of them, and the best of those guns was barely held together by wire and string. Ned was the best shot, so he took it. They talked the police camp, and waited until the afternoon shadows grew long. And then, the police officers made that classic mistake: They split the party. Two of them go scouting, while the other two remained behind to make camp. As soon as he is sure they're alone, Ned steps out of the bushes, and shouts: ""BAIL UP! THROW UP YOUR HANDS!"" The first man, constable McIntyre, does so immediately. The other man races for the cover of a nearby log, and pulls his own revolver. He peers over the log, and takes aim, but... Ned pulls a Han Solo. The shot goes right into the officer's eye, giving him just enough time to scream that he's dying, then he falls. Constable McIntyre, hands still in the air, watches Ned slowly approached the corpse. Ned as never killed a man before, much less a police officer. McIntyre hears him wonder out loud: ""What made the fool run?"" But it's done now, Ned Kelly has killed a policeman, and the day is not over yet. There are still two more police officers out scouting, and Ned doesn't want to repeat this incident. He promises not to hurt McIntyre. All he really wants is to take the horses and the guns, and send this whole search party home empty-handed. They have a chat while Ned's friends searched the camp, and McIntyre agrees to help convince the other officers to surrender peacefully. They should be back soon. But when they do return, they do not take kindly to McIntyre's suggestion that the surrender. And they take even less kindly to having Ned's gang points guns at them. After all their bragging about shooting Ned on sight, one officer tries to do exactly that. But he misses, and Ned shoots him off his horse. The officer fires also, but he knows he's outgunned. He makes a break for the trees, and Ned runs after him. In the commotion, officer McIntyre grabs a loose horse, and takes off at a desperate gallop. Leaving the final officer alone to meet his fate, at the hands of Ned Kelly. When McIntyre roars back into town with news of the murdered policeman, everything changes for Ned Kelly and his three companions. They are no longer the Greta Mob, they are the Kelly Gang. "
501,Education,27,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,stznrpS3_Gc,"All of this kinda connects to this. We added sound. It's a silent movie. This chart shows all the movies directed or produced by legendary director D.W. Griffith in 1912. He was a Hollywood titan, but most of his movies? They were about the same length. Around 15 minutes, with the exceptions topping out around a half hour long. Now look at the run time for 1915’s Birth of A Nation. What happened there? The reason movies changed from 15 minute trifles to “featured attractions,” can be traced to one silent movie. It changed the game in a way that transformed all movies. But it wasn’t invented in Hollywood. It came from 6,000 miles away. This is a foot — here you go metric people. Early silent film historians actually talk about these movies in...feet. And it makes sense — the same way that measuring tape comes on a reel, movies come on reels too. One reel of film is 1,000 feet, give or take. That’s 15 minutes or fewer, depending on what frame rate you play it back at. In the early days of movies — the 1900s — almost all movies were about 1,000 feet. One reel. 15 minutes or fewer. These short movies were usually screened in variety shows or a smorgasbord of short films. You’d drop into a Nickelodeon — a lower-class theatre where you’d see a bunch of movies for a nickel — 5 cents. You’d see Laura Comstock’s Bag Punching Dog, followed by The Trapeze Disrobing Act, followed by the first screen adaptation of Frankenstein. The whole thing was 14 minutes long - 975 feet. In America, some of this was enforced by East Coast movie trusts that controlled and licensed movie patents for film and projection. They preferred single and double reel films. But even renegade filmmakers out in Hollywood kept movies pretty short. And, with some exceptions, so did filmmakers across Europe. It was just easier to transport and project one-reel films. That chart, from the beginning? It’s not a chart of time, but feet. And this right here is a thousand feet - that one reel cutoff. For the most part, movies were...small. Until the Italians thought bigger. Italian movies were were becoming spectacles in the 1900s. They were breaking out of the standard 15-minute short, and trying new things. By being outside the American system of high-powered movie trusts, one film in particular was able to rewrite the rules. That’s 1913’s Quo Vadis — an epic story of Romans in the time of Nero. To tell that story the Italian filmmakers took 2 whole hours - not 15 minutes. It was 8,000 feet long! To get people to see it, Quo Vadis’s promoters needed to invent a new business model. Instead of trying to force the long movie into those movie theaters playing a bunch of one-reel shorts, promoters rented out classy concert halls for Quo Vadis alone. They did the same in the US, at the Astor Theatre in New York, and playing the “mammoth photodrama” everywhere from Arkansas to the future state of Hawaii. To draw crowds from nickelodeons into those big halls to watch just one really long thing, Quo Vadis needed to be special. It used real Roman locations, thousands of extras, and the first big stunts - like chariot races where the actors rode real chariots and gladiatorial battles with big hits and realistic weapons. The posters sold the spectacle — and sold out seats. And people noticed. In the years following the release of Quo Vadis, DW Griffith, increased the length of his own movies. Quo Vadis and other Italian epics were proof that big movies could work. Griffith’s movies like “Judith of Bethulia” crept into feature film lengths - 61 minutes, a full 4 reels. He released Birth of a Nation in 1915. It was sold as the “mightiest spectacle ever produced” — and a long one clocking in at 12 reels. It had big stunts too, like many big battle scenes. Now this movie was so controversial that people called it racist in 1915. I mean, the KKK are the good guys. But despite that, it brought the spectacle of Quo Vadis to Hollywood. The trusts that wanted to keep movies short were already fading. The public’s love of long movies finished the job. Birth of a Nation solidified single movies as a style worth funding and paying for. And even though today, we don’t measure movies in feet, Quo Vadis is not a relic. This chart shows average movie times for the most popular 25 movies each year, from 1930 on. This time here? It’s 2013, 100 years after the 120 minute Quo Vadis came out. The running time? 121.4 minutes. This edition of Almanac’s all about big changes to the movies that came from outside Hollywood, and there are a ton of other business model changes like Quo Vadis, so let me know some of the ones that you’ve heard about in the comments. However, I just to just prove to you one more time that Quo Vadis really was a huge hit. This is an ad for “When Ursus Threw the Bull,” a parody movie that was made in response to Quo Vadis’s enormous success. "

A house by the sea, somewhere in Norway Inside the screaming of one becomes the screaming of two. The baby is a boy. They wrap him in soft wool. His parents are no one special, No scald will sing of his deeds and history will not remember his name. His family are not lords or warriors. Yet, he and people like him will spread Scandinavian influence From Constantinople to Western lands unseen by Europeans, For this village prizes one skill above all others. The father takes his newborn son and lays him in a crib; a crib shaped like a boat. *Intro music* Between the eighth and the tenth centuries, a startling event occurred in northern Europe. Throughout the whole of Scandinavia, men and women took to the Seas with the intention to raid, settle and trade with new lands. Within three centuries, they would trade goods in Constantinople, build the city of Dublin, establish a dynasty in France, found a kingdom in England and give Russia its name. And famously, this Viking expansion would culminate in a series of voyages that left settlements on Iceland, Greenland and briefly North America. Medieval Scandinavians achieved this through superior technology, flexible tactics and business savvy, but surprisingly also without central leadership or even a common vision. Instead it was a distributed effort where groups of adventurers struck out into Europe's waterways in search of profit, power and fame. And in this series, we'll chart the most successful of those efforts and how they changed the face of Europe But before we get to that, let's take a look at Scandinavian society, Specifically what motivated medieval Scandinavians to take to the waves and, once they did, why were they so successful? That question of motivation is actually tough to answer One school of thought holds that overpopulation or climate change led to resource scarcity and food shortages Causing Scandinavians to seek out new lands or, at least wealth to buy land back home. Others say the consolidation of political power and Scandinavian society (Basically the rise of powerful kings) created a class of displaced warrior nobles looking to recapture wealth and status Still others point out that by the eighth century Europe had finally begun to recover from the collapse of the Western Roman Empire Complex trade and monetary systems were on the rise meaning that after centuries of existing via the barter system people in Europe finally had goods that were, well actually worth stealing Moreover, these new luxury goods were portable. After all, Vikings weren't going to cross the North Sea and sack an English port just to steal all of its cows. Silver and precious stones though, those were easy things to loot. But in all likelihood, There was no single event that drove the Viking expansion. The evidence points to a combination of factors that convinced Scandinavians to strike out with the sail and the sword. As to why they were so successful, for that, Let's go back to the same house we visited earlier. The child who lay in the boat-shaped crib is now 13 and getting ready to accompany his father to sea. His is a nautical family. The house he grew up, indeed every house in the village is shaped like an upturned ship. They live on the coast of Norway with the North Sea on one side and a great ridge of mountains Known as the keel on the other as a boy He learned to sail small craft in the sheltered fjords fishing and ferrying passengers But this will be his first time sailing to foreign lands. He is well-prepared. Years of helping his mother handle farming and livestock have made him strong and village leisure activities have reinforced the importance of physical fitness He spends his summers in wrestling contests mock sword fights boxing and foot races Unusually for a medieval European he can swim for several miles in the depths of winter He spends his time playing music listening to and reciting poetry matching wits over board games and drinking Vast quantities of mead this isn't all fun and games though these games songs and tales weigh nothing cultural comforts that can be carried across the world while taking up no cargo space and Under his boat roofed haul heavy with snow he learned how to exist in a small space with other men for months at a time without descending into violence When the village needs to build or repair a boat, He assists the craftsman selecting Greenwood and learning how to cut with the grain to give the timber strength Boatyard elders work him until he memorized each angle and spar of the clinker style construction forming mental blueprints of the craft Now if he and his crew are wrecked on a foreign Shore they can build a new boat from memory But now his training is over he and his father set off in their vessel armed not with swords but with furs, honey, and walrus ivory They are not Vikings in fact very few Scandinavians were and Viking is actually a verb to go on a raid is to go Viking and a person who goes Viking is a Viking er, but the boy and his father are not Vikingrs and their ship is not one of the famous long ships They sail akun are a trading vessel that is shorter and wider than its warlike cousin It has decks and a hold that can carry 30 to 40 tons But a draught of only 5 feet meaning it can navigate even shallow rivers Its keel keeps it steady during the crossing to the British Isles and as it navigates its first storm the boy no longer has to wonder why skaldak poems refer to ships as serpents the Flexible hull twists in the water bending where other ships would break the Navigator shows the boy how to orient himself on the open sea how to chart by the Stars and look for telltale signs of Land in cloud formations and passing birds, they count oar strokes to determine their speed.

They've just visited were there guards at the port a monastery Did they cite any army camps or cavalry along the shore? At other times they give fellow Scandinavians a wide berth. Not everyone can be trusted over the years the boy learns that people in trading ports consider all Scandinavians the same the Irish call them the dark and fair foreigners and the Franks refer to them as North men Though their crews hail from Norway the English see no distinction and refer to all Scandinavians as Danes But the Scandinavians themselves see a great deal of difference the Norwegians and Danes often feud. After all, geography often shapes culture and there's little similarity between mountainous Norway and the flat river lands of Denmark The Swedes largely control trade into the waterways of Eastern Europe and dislike others encroaching on their territory At times a great leader might unite a coalition of war bands from different places But it was tempting fate for a Norwegian trader to pull up alongside an unfamiliar Danish longship In time the boy became a man. He learned his father's trade well and married He too would lay his sons in a boat shaped crib and take them to sea teaching them to barter in the trading ports and once even taking them on a risky venture to the lavish markets of Constantinople, the man was not rich though full of profit a lifetime of trading on the sea also exposes a family to loss storms, bad investments and raids by fellow Scandinavians blunted his fortune Long voyages make for rocky marriages and after 20 years his wife declared divorce Claiming half his property. He accepted this and remarried his former wife had after all followed the law When he died, he could not be buried in the lavish style of the wealthy Lords instead his sons dug him a simple grave and filled it with his favorite possessions and to Mark the spot to honor the man who had crossed the ocean and exchanged goods across the world They laid him to rest inside a ring of stones a ring Shaped like a boat "
503,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,tCeklW2e6_E,"After a massive storm tears  through the Hex Archipelago, you find five grizzled  survivors in the water. Shivering their timbers, they explain that they’re the former crew  of the great pirate Greenbeard, who marooned them  after they tried to mutiny. Each was bound up in a different spot on a small island, until the storm washed them out to sea. In gratitude for saving them,  they reveal a secret: the island they were on is also where  Greenbeard has buried his treasure hoard. But when the sailors try to describe  the island, something seems off. All agree it was flat and barren with no prominent features except for some trees. Yet each pirate claims they saw a different number of trees, ranging from two to six. The pirate who saw two trees says the treasure was buried right at his feet. When you fly your hot air balloon  over the area to investigate, you see hundreds of small islands, each with exactly six trees. The next storm will be here soon, so you’ll have to hurry and narrow your search. What does the island with Greenbeard’s treasure look like from the sky? And where will the treasure be  on that island? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in 3 Answer in 2 Answer in 1 It might seem like the pirates  are delirious from dehydration. But that’s not what’s going on. Remember, each was confined to a separate point on the island, and no two of them could see the same number of trees. That means that for all but one pirate, something was blocking their view. And since there are no other features on the island, that something could only  have been other trees. A pirate would see fewer trees  when two or more fell along a straight line from their vantage point. So we need to find the island where five different pirates standing  in different spots would each see a different number of trees. Virtually every island has a position from which you can see six trees. And on most islands there’s a position where 5 trees can be seen by standing in line with two of them. It turns out that the hardest locations to find are those with fewer visible trees precisely because they require more trees to line up with the viewer’s position. So how can we see just two trees? One way would be if all the trees were lined up in single file, such as on this island. Then, you could stand at the end  of the line and see one, stand in the middle and see two, or stand anywhere else and see all six. But there’s no place from  which you can see only three, four, or five, so one straight line of trees is out. So what about two lines of trees? So long as the lines aren’t parallel and they intersect over land, there’ll always be a position  where the two lines converge from which you could  see exactly two trees. And if they’re grouped two and four, or three and three, there are many arrangements in which  you could also see three, four, five, and six trees. Fortunately for us, there’s only  one island in the archipelago with two non-parallel lines of trees, and it’ll be buried at the intersection of the two lines. You land on this island and dig up a chest containing a massive pile of tree seeds, ready for planting. Was this treasure really worth  all that trouble? That’s a matter of perspective. "
504,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,uHbn7wLN_3k,"There are currently hundreds of thousands  of people on transplant lists, waiting for critical organs like kidneys,  hearts, and livers that could save their lives. Unfortunately, there aren’t nearly enough donor organs  available to fill that demand. What if instead of waiting, we could create brand-new, customized organs from scratch? That’s the idea behind bioprinting, a branch of regenerative medicine  currently under development. We’re not able to print complex  organs just yet, but simpler tissues including blood vessels and tubes responsible for nutrient and waste exchange are already in our grasp. Bioprinting is a biological cousin of 3-D printing, a technique that deposits layers of material on top of each other to construct a three-dimensional object one slice at a time. Instead of starting with metal, plastic,  or ceramic, a 3-D printer for organs and  tissues uses bioink: a printable material that contains living cells. The bulk of many bioinks are water-rich molecules called hydrogels. Mixed into those are  millions of living cells as well as various chemicals that  encourage cells to communicate and grow. Some bioinks include a  single type of cell, while others combine several different kinds to produce more complex structures. Let’s say you want to print a meniscus, which is a piece of cartilage in the knee that keeps the shinbone and thighbone from grinding against each other. It’s made up of cells called chondrocytes, and you’ll need a healthy supply of  them for your bioink. These cells can come from donors whose cell lines are replicated in a lab. Or they might originate from a  patient’s own tissue to create a personalized meniscus less likely to be rejected by their body. There are several printing techniques, and the most popular is extrusion-based bioprinting. In this, bioink gets loaded into a  printing chamber and pushed through a round nozzle  attached to a printhead. It emerges from a nozzle that’s rarely  wider than 400 microns in diameter, and can produce a continuous filament roughly the thickness of a human fingernail. A computerized image or file guides the placement of the strands, either onto a flat surface or into a  liquid bath that’ll help hold the structure in place  until it stabilizes. These printers are fast, producing the  meniscus in about half an hour, one thin strand at a time. After printing, some bioinks will stiffen immediately; others need UV light or an additional chemical or physical process to stabilize the structure. If the printing process is successful, the cells in the synthetic tissue will begin to behave the same way cells do in real tissue: signaling to each other, exchanging  nutrients, and multiplying. We can already print relatively simple  structures like this meniscus. Bioprinted bladders have also been  successfully implanted, and printed tissue has promoted facial  nerve regeneration in rats. Researchers have created lung tissue, skin, and cartilage, as well as miniature, semi-functional  versions of kidneys, livers, and hearts. However, replicating the complex  biochemical environment of a major organ is a steep challenge. Extrusion-based bioprinting may destroy a significant percentage of cells in the  ink if the nozzle is too small, or if the printing pressure is too high. One of the most formidable challenges is how to supply oxygen and nutrients  to all the cells in a full-size organ. That’s why the greatest successes so far have been with structures that are flat or hollow— and why researchers are busy  developing ways to incorporate blood vessels  into bioprinted tissue. There’s tremendous potential to use  bioprinting to save lives and advance our understanding of how our organs function  in the first place. And the technology opens up a dizzying  array of possibilities, such as printing tissues with  embedded electronics. Could we one day engineer organs that  exceed current human capability, or give ourselves features like  unburnable skin? How long might we extend human life  by printing and replacing our organs? And exactly who—and what— will have access to this technology and its incredible output? "
505,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,uRhkDN2WjzI,"4,000 years ago, the ancient Sumerians made a surprising discovery. If they scraped the bark  off a particular kind of tree and ate it, their pain disappeared. Little did they know that why they'd found was destined to influence  the future course of medicine. What the Sumerians had discovered was a precursor to the medicine known today as aspirin. Aspirin's active ingredient is found commonly in willow trees and other wild plants, which is how it came to infuse the medical traditions of Sumer, ancient Egypt, ancient Greece, and other cultures. Around 400 BC, Hippocrates, thought  of as the father of modern medicine, first recommended chewing willow bark for pain relief and making willow leaf tea to ease the pain of childbirth. But it took over 2,000 years for us to comprehensively investigate its potential. In the mid-18th century, an Englishman named Edward Stone ran five years of experiments, showing that willow bark crushed into a powder and eaten could cure a fever. It took nearly another 70 years for a German pharmacist, Johann Buchner, to finally identify and purify the substance that made all this possible, a compound called salicin. By then, doctors were routinely using willow bark and other salicin-rich plants, like the herb meadowsweet, to ease pain, fever, and inflammation. But identifying the exact compound suddenly opened up the possibility of manipulating its form. In 1853, a French chemist managed to chemically synthesize the compound, creating a substance called acetylsalicylic acid. Then in 1897, the pharmaceutical company Bayer found a new method and began marketing the compound as a pain reliever called aspirin. This was widely recognized as one of the first synthetic pharmaceutical drugs. Originally, aspirin was  just Bayer's brand name: A for acetyl, and spir for meadowsweet, whose botanical name is Spiraea ulmaria. Soon, aspirin became synonymous with acetylsalicylic acid. As its influence grew, aspirin was found to ease not just pain, but also many inflammation-related problems, like rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, which enflames  the fluid-filled sack around the heart, and Kawasaki disease, where blood vessels become inflamed. Yet, despite aspirin's medical value, at this point, scientists still didn't actually know how it worked. In the 1960s and 70s, Swedish and British scientists changed that. They showed that the drug interrupts the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins, which control the transmission  of pain sensations and inflammation. In 1982, that discovery won  the researchers a Nobel Prize in Medicine. Over time, research has also uncovered aspirin's risks. Overconsumption can cause bleeding in the intestines and the brain. It can also trigger Reye's Syndrome, a rare but often fatal illness that affects the brain and liver in children with an infection. And in the late 20th century, aspirin's success had been overshadowed by newer pain killers with fewer side effects, like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. But in the 1980s, further discoveries about aspirin's benefits revived interest in it. In fact, the 1982 Nobel Prize winners  also demonstrated that aspirin slows production  of thromboxanes, chemicals that cause clumping of platelets, which in turn form blood clots. A landmark clinical trial showed that aspirin reduced heart attack risk by 44% in participants who took the drug. Today, we prescribe it to people at risk of heart attack or stroke because it cuts the likelihood of clots forming in the arteries that supply the heart and brain. Even more intriguingly, there's a growing body of research that suggests aspirin reduces the risk of getting and dying from cancer, especially colorectal cancer. This might be due to aspirin's anti-platelet effects. By reducing platelet activity, aspirin may decrease the levels of a certain protein that helps cancer cells spread. These discoveries have transformed aspirin from a mere pain reliever to a potentially life-saving treatment. Today, we consume about 100 billion aspirin tablets each year, and researchers continue searching for new applications. Already, aspirin's versatility has transformed modern medicine, which is astounding considering its humble beginnings in a scraping of willow bark. "
506,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ukUPojrPFPA,"Your internship in Professor Ramsey’s physics lab has been amazing. Until, that is, the professor accidentally stepped through a time portal. You’ve got just a minute to jump through the portal to save him before it closes and leaves him stranded in history. Once you’re through it, the portal will close, and your only way back will be  to create a new one using the chrono-nodules from your lab. Activated nodules connect to each other via red or blue tachyon entanglement. Activate more nodules and they’ll connect to all other nodules in the area. As soon as a red or blue triangle is created with a nodule at each point, it opens a doorway through time that will take you back to the present. But the color of each individual connection manifests at random, and there’s no way to choose or change its color. And there’s one more problem: each individual nodule creates a temporal instability that raises the chances the portal might collapse as you go through it. So the fewer you bring, the better. The portal’s about to close. What’s the minimum number of nodules  you need to bring to be certain you’ll create a red or  blue triangle and get back to the present? Pause here if you want to figure it out for yourself! Answer in: 3 Answer in: 2 Answer in: 1 This question is so rich that an entire branch of mathematics known as Ramsey Theory developed from it. Ramsey Theory is home to some famously difficult problems. This one isn’t easy, but it can be handled if you approach it systematically. Imagine you brought just three nodules. Would that be enough? No - for example, you might have two blue and one red connection, and be stuck in the past forever. Would four nodules be enough? No - there are many arrangements here that don’t give a blue or red triangle. What about five? It turns out there is an arrangement of connections that avoids creating a blue or red triangle. These smaller triangles don’t count because they don’t have a nodule at each corner. However, six nodules will always create a blue triangle or a red triangle. Here’s how we can prove that without sorting through every possible case. Imagine activating the sixth nodule, and consider how it might connect to the other five. It could do so in one of six ways: with five red connections, five blue connections, or some mix of red and blue. Notice that every possibility has at least three connections of the same color coming from this nodule. Let’s look at just the nodules on the other end of those same three color connections. If the connections were blue, then any additional blue connection between those three would give us a blue triangle. So the only way we could get in trouble is if all the connections between them were red. But those three red connections would give us a red triangle. No matter what happens, we’ll get a red or a blue triangle, and open our doorway.  On the other hand, if the original three connections  were all red instead of blue, the same argument still works,  with all the colors flipped. In other words, no matter how the connections are colored, six nodules will always create a red or blue triangle and a doorway leading home. So you grab six nodules and jump through the portal. You were hoping your internship would give you valuable life experience. Turns out, that didn’t take much time. "
507,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,v-t1Z5-oPtU,"Cramming for a test? Trying to get more done than you have time to do? Stress is a feeling we all experience when we are challenged or overwhelmed. But more than just an emotion, stress is a hardwired physical response that travels throughout your entire body. In the short term, stress can be advantageous, but when activated too often or too long, your primitive fight or flight  stress response not only changes your brain but also damages many of the other organs and cells throughout your body. Your adrenal gland releases  the stress hormones cortisol, epinephrine, also known as adrenaline, and norepinephrine. As these hormones travel through your blood stream, they easily reach your blood vessels and heart. Adrenaline causes  your heart to beat faster and raises your blood pressure, over time causing hypertension. Cortisol can also cause the endothelium, or inner lining of blood vessels, to not function normally. Scientists now know  that this is an early step in triggering the process  of atherosclerosis or cholesterol plaque build up in your arteries. Together, these changes increase your chances of a heart attack or stroke. When your brain senses stress, it activates your  autonomic nervous system. Through this network of nerve connections, your big brain communicates stress to your enteric, or intestinal nervous system. Besides causing butterflies  in your stomach, this brain-gut connection can disturb the natural rhythmic contractions that move food through your gut, leading to irritable bowel syndrome, and can increase your  gut sensitivity to acid, making you more likely to feel heartburn. Via the gut's nervous system, stress can also change the composition and function of your gut bacteria, which may affect your digestive and overall health. Speaking of digestion, does chronic stress affect your waistline? Well, yes. Cortisol can increase your appetite. It tells your body to replenish your energy stores with energy dense foods and carbs, causing you to crave comfort foods. High levels of cortisol can also cause you to put on those extra calories as visceral or deep belly fat. This type of fat doesn't just make it harder to button your pants. It is an organ  that actively releases hormones and immune system chemicals called cytokines that can increase your risk of developing chronic diseases, such as heart disease  and insulin resistance. Meanwhile, stress hormones affect immune cells in a variety of ways. Initially, they help prepare to fight invaders and heal after injury, but chronic stress can dampen function of some immune cells, make you more susceptible to infections, and slow the rate you heal. Want to live a long life? You may have to curb your chronic stress. That's because it has even been associated with shortened telomeres, the shoelace tip ends of chromosomes that measure a cell's age. Telomeres cap chromosomes to allow DNA to get copied every time a cell divides without damaging  the cell's genetic code, and they shorten with each cell division. When telomeres become too short, a cell can no longer divide and it dies. As if all that weren't enough, chronic stress has even more ways it can sabotage your health, including acne, hair loss, sexual dysfunction, headaches, muscle tension, difficulty concentrating, fatigue, and irritability. So, what does all this mean for you? Your life will always be filled with stressful situations. But what matters to your brain and entire body is how you respond to that stress. If you can view those situations as challenges you can control and master, rather than as threats that are insurmountable, you will perform better in the short run and stay healthy in the long run. "
508,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,v5FL9VTBZzQ,"Imagine you're asked to invent something new. It could be whatever you want made from anything you choose in any shape or size. That kind of creative freedom sounds so liberating, doesn't it? Or does it? If you're like most people, you'd probably be paralyzed by this task. Without more guidance, where would you even begin? As it turns out, boundless freedom isn't always helpful. In reality, any project is restricted by many factors, such as the cost, what materials you have at your disposal, and unbreakable laws of physics. These factors are called  creative constraints, and they're the requirements and limitations we have to address  in order to accomplish a goal. Creative constraints apply  across professions, to architects and artists, writers, engineers, and scientists. In many fields, constraints play a special role as drivers of discovery and invention. During the scientific process  in particular, constraints are an essential part of experimental design. For instance, a scientist studying a new virus would consider, ""How can I use the tools  and techniques at hand to create an experiment that tells me how this virus infects the body's cells? And what are the limits of my knowledge that prevent me from understanding this new viral pathway?"" In engineering, constraints have us apply our scientific discoveries to invent something new and useful. Take, for example,  the landers Viking 1 and 2, which relied on thrusters to arrive safely on the surface of Mars. The problem? Those thrusters left foreign chemicals on the ground, contaminating soil samples. So a new constraint was introduced. How can we land a probe on Mars without introducing chemicals from Earth? The next Pathfinder mission used an airbag system to allow the rover to bounce and roll to a halt without burning contaminating fuel. Years later, we wanted to send a much larger rover: Curiosity. However, it was too large  for the airbag design, so another constraint was defined. How can we land a large rover while still keeping rocket fuel away from the Martian soil? In response, engineers had a wild idea. They designed a skycrane. Similar to the claw machine at toy stores, it would lower the rover from high above the surface. With each invention, the engineers demonstrated an essential habit of scientific thinking - that solutions must recognize the limitations of current technology in order to advance it. Sometimes this progress is iterative, as in, ""How can I make a better parachute to land my rover?"" And sometimes, it's innovative, like how to reach our goal when the best possible  parachute isn't going to work. In both cases, the constraints  guide decision-making to ensure we reach each objective. Here's another Mars problem yet to be solved. Say we want to send astronauts who will need water. They'd rely on a filtration system that keeps the water very clean and enables 100% recovery. Those are some pretty tough constraints, and we may not have  the technology for it now. But in the process of trying to meet these objectives, we might discover other applications of any inventions that result. Building an innovative  water filtration system could provide a solution for farmers working in drought-stricken regions, or a way to clean municipal water in polluted cities. In fact, many scientific advances have occurred when serendipitous failures in one field address the constraints of another. When scientist Alexander Fleming mistakenly contaminated a Petri dish in the lab, it led to the discovery of the first antibiotic, penicillin. The same is true of synthetic dye, plastic, and gunpowder. All were created mistakenly, but went on to address the constraints of other problems. Understanding constraints guides scientific progress, and what's true in science is also true in many other fields. Constraints aren't the boundaries of creativity, but the foundation of it. "
509,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,vcPJkz-D5II,"The evolutionary tango  of animal genitalia. Can you guess what you're looking at? If you answered ""duck vagina,"" you'd be right. Although the bird's outward appearance may not strike you as especially odd, it uses this strange, intricate, cork-screw shaped contraption  to reproduce. We see similarly unbelievable genitalia in insects, mammals, reptiles, fish, spiders, and even snails. Apparently, no organs evolve faster and into more variable shapes than those involved in procreation. Superficially, it makes sense because evolution works via reproduction. When an animal leaves more offspring, its genes will spread. And since genitalia are an animal's tools for reproduction, any improvement there  will have immediate effect. And yet, what's the point of having such decorative nether regions? After all, the function  of genitalia seems simple. A penis deposits a bit of sperm and a vagina receives it and delivers it to the egg. A pipette-like thingy on the male and a funnel-like gizmo on the female should do just fine for any animal. And yet, that's not what we see. The penis of a chicken flea, for example, looks nothing like a pipette, more like an exploded grandfather clock. And the vagina of a featherwing beetle resembles something you'd find in a Dr. Seuss book. Throughout the animal kingdom, genitalia are very complex things, much more complicated than seems necessary for what they're meant to do. That's because genitalia do more than just deposit and receive sperm. Many male animals also use the penis as courtship device, like crane flies. In some South American species, males have a tiny washboard and scraper on their penis, which produces a song that reverberates throughout the female's body when they mate. It's thought that if female crane flies enjoy this unusual serenade, they'll allow the male  to father their offspring. This way, the genes of the most musical penises spread, leading to rapid evolution of insects' phalluses. Similarly, some beetles have two little drumsticks on either side of the penis. During mating, they'll rub, slap, or tap the female with these. And some hoofed mammals, like rams and bulls, use a whip-like extension on the penis's left side to create a sensation during mating. But how can females really choose between males if she can only assess them after mating? This is where the power of female adaptation comes into play. In fact, insemination is different to conception, and the female genitalia exploit this distinction. For instance, in some dung flies, the vagina contains pockets for separating sperm from different males depending on how appealing they were. Males using their penises for courtship and females controlling their own sperm management are two reasons why genitalia evolve into such complex shapes. But there are others because genitalia are also where a sexual conflict is played out. A female's interests are best served if she fertilizes her eggs with the sperm of the best fathers and creates genetic variability amongst her offspring. For a male, on the other hand, this is bad news. For him, it would be best if a female used his sperm to fertilize all of her eggs. So we see cycles of adaptation in an evolutionary arms race to retain control. Black widow spiders have a disposable penis tip that breaks off inside the vagina blocking the attempts of his rivals, and bed bug males bypass a female's genitalia altogether using a syringe-like penis to inject sperm cells directly into her belly. Not to be outdone, females have evolved their own countermeasures. In some bed bug species, the females have evolved an entirely new set of genitalia on their right hand flanks where the males usually pierce them. That allows them to maintain the power to filter out unwanted sperm with their genitalia. And duck vaginas are shaped like a clockwise spiral so that when the male inflates his long, counterclockwise coiled penis into her, and she disapproves, all she needs to do  is flex her vaginal muscles and the penis just flubs out. So, genitalia differs so much, not just to fascinate us, but because in every species, they're the result of a furious evolutionary tango of sex that has been going on for millions of years and will continue for millions  of years to come.

510,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,vmYcxEOBk_8,"The year is 1202, the dawn of a new century. Temüjin Khan now rivals Jamukha in power. The future of the Mongols could fall to either of them, and Temüjin, already a radical, is about to institute yet another set of revolutionary changes to a society that has hardly changed at all in a thousand years Music [Birth of the People] One year after the defeat of the Taichiud, an aging Ong Khan sent Temüjin on a new campaign to once again plunder the Tartars Having now grown as a leader and a warrior, Temüjin introduced new changes and tactics which would forever alter the way battle was done on the steppe. See traditional Mongol raids had warriors rushing  into camps while their victims either fled, or stayed to defend their possessions. The fighting would then devolve into chaos, as the raiders raced to loot and pillage, trying to grab the best prizes for themselves, rather than chasing down enemy warriors. Temüjin realized that these acts of personal greed got in the way of a more complete victory, and left his troops vulnerable to counter-attack from resentful enemies. This raid would be different. He declared that no looting would take place until total victory had been accomplished. Looting would then be done in an organized fashion, with all goods being brought to Temüjin and then redistributed among his followers, using much the same system that mountain hunters used to distribute kills at the end of a group hunt. Temüjin also ordered that a share of the wealth be allocated to anybody widowed or orphaned as a result of the raid. This ensured that what had happened to his mother when his father was killed, would never again happen to another Mongol family. These changes guaranteed him the support of the poorest people in the tribe. And inspired loyalty among his soldiers, who now knew that their families would be cared for if they fell in battle. But these changes alienated some of his more  well-off followers, as it denied them their traditional right to distribute prizes to their underlings as they saw fit. Still it was a trade worth the making, as this move greatly centralized the power of his rule and incentivized loyalty. In enriching Temüjin, his followers were also enriching themselves. This new system was a resounding success. For the second time, Temüjin defeated the Tartars. And by postponing the looting until the end of the campaign, the army amassed more wealth than ever before. There was, however a new problem; In keeping with their usual policy of executing leaders and integrating everybody else, They had now captured almost an entire army and all of the civilians. The old method had worked great when they were dealing with a clan of hundreds, but the Tartars numbered in the thousands. It was imperative to Temüjin to end the vicious, constant, conflicts between steppe lineages. And it seems to him that integrating everyone under one unified banner was the only way to achieve this. But in order to bring the numerous Tartars into his Khanate he would need the full support of his followers. He summoned a Kurultai to discuss a solution, And the one they found was vicious, but effective. They summoned all of the Tartar men and ordered each one to walk by a cart. Every male taller than the linchpin, which held the wheels on the cart, was executed. Once the older and larger Tartar males were culled, the remaining men and their families were taken in as full members of his tribe. Temüjin adopted another Tartar orphan, and took two aristocratic Tartar women as additional wives. That handled, Temüjin had yet more ancient traditions to abolish. If he really wanted to establish lasting peace among the steppe tribes, he would have to radically transform their military and tribal system. He would have to do away with the traditional system of kin groups altogether. He organized his warriors into squads of ten, who were then ordered to live and fight together. These groups were of mixed origin and lineage. By forcing people to serve as units rather than kin groups, Temüjin managed to break their ancient lineages and ethnic identities. Each squad began with the oldest as their leader, but they could elect any man among them if they chose. Ten of these squads formed the company of one hundred men, one of whom they elected to be their leader. And ten of those companies formed a battalion of one thousand individuals. The leader of each battalion was chosen by Temüjin, further cementing his power. And, under the new system, all members of the tribe, regardless of age or gender, had to perform public service for the benefit of the tribe, Including caring for herds, gathering fuel, cooking, repairing weapons or even performing music to entertain the troops. And just like that, there were no more lineages or classes. Everyone worked for the benefit of the tribe, and everyone reaped the rewards. Finally, Temüjin created a closed territory designated as the homeland of the Mongols. For its location he chose the sacred site where he had hidden from the Merkit traders in his youth. And he closed it to all outsiders except the Mongol  royal family, who would continue to bury their dead and conduct ritual gatherings there for the next two centuries. This land became the secret ritual center of the new Mongol identity. After almost 20 years of work, Temüjin now controlled most of the Mongols. But Jamukha was still a large and looming threat. Ong Khan was getting older, but it was not yet clear who would take over for him, so Temüjin decided to force Ong Khan's hand, And proposed that his eldest son Jochi marry one of Ong Khan's daughters. This would be an acknowledgment of Temüjin as his heir. Ong Khan's eldest son, who had no following of his own, was envious of Temüjin's power and relationship with his father. And strongly encouraged Ong Khan to reject the proposal, Despite the fact that doing so would be a grave insult. Ong Khan was swayed and he rejected Temüjin outright. Fearing a military response though, Ong Khan quickly devised a nefarious plot to rid himself of Temüjin through trickery. He sent Temüjin a message saying that he had changed his mind, setting a wedding date and inviting Temüjin to come alone to celebrate with the family. So Temüjin set out with a small band to see his patron, confident that he was about to secure his position to succeed Ong Khan as future ruler of the central steppes. Then, just one day's ride from Ong Khan's court, one of Temüjin's allies rode up with terrible news; Ong Khan had an army nearby, preparing to wipe him out. Temüjin was trapped. Wildly outnumbered, separated from his allies with the enemy at his heels, He could not afford to fight. He did the only thing he could do; he ordered his small group to scatter in all directions and fled. Temüjin was devastated. This was supposed to be his moment of triumph. When he reunited with his followers far from Ong Khan's territory, he found that only a few remained. Some of his relatives had deserted in a panic, others had simply gotten lost on the steppe. Now what few remained faced starvation in their  remote exile, And his newly united people were now without their leader. Temüjin resolved to act quickly while Ong Khan basked in the glory of his victory. He sent messengers to his tens of thousands of followers, Hoping that they would follow his order to assemble. And amazingly, they did. Imagine tens of thousands of people, Separated from their leader but still converging, maintaining order and discipline. This was the effect of Temüjin's new discipline, his new societal structure. This army thundered toward the unsuspecting Ong Khan, who feasted and celebrated in his palatial golden Yurt. Loyal followers had gone so far as to leave fresh horses for Temüjin's army along the way, So they could continue night and day without resting. In the middle of the night, and without warning, Temüjin's army completely surrounded the enemy camp, And crashed down on Ong Khan's court, days before he thought they'd arrive. Nobles fled in all directions, Including Ong Khan and Jamukha, who managed to escape the fighting and flee to the nearby Naiman tribe, the greatest of the tribes not yet conquered by Temüjin. Jamukha made it safely across the Naiman border, But Ong Khan was stopped by a guard, who couldn't believe that this hagered old man was the Great Khan he claimed to be, And killed him. Temüjin now turned his sights to the Naiman, Jamika's new ally. Now at last, the decisive battle against Jamukha had finally, finally come. For the first time, Temüjin's new military organization would be put to the test in an all-out battle. Squads of 10 advanced silently in the pre-dawn darkness, so the enemy couldn't see how many people were attacking, or from which direction. The squads would then attack and then immediately flee in different directions, making retaliation impossible. After hours of these harrying hit-and-run attacks, Temüjin advanced with a long line of troops, who fired their arrows and then melted back behind the next line; their replacements. The Naiman attempted to counter this by spreading out a long thin line, to meet the attacking archers and avoid being flanked. In response, Temüjin switched tactics yet again, rearranging his men into a narrow deep configuration, which allowed them to chisel through the thinned Naiman lines. Victory was swift and complete. Jamukha fled again, and in a poetic twist of fate, ended up hiding in the woods just as Temüjin once had as a boy. Himself now a disgraced outcast bandit at the age of 40. In time, his followers found and delivered him to Temüjin. Jamukha asked only for an honorable death, which Temüjin granted. It was finally over. Temüjin had won. At long last, he was to become the Khan of all Mongols. Music [The Infinite Steppe] Subscribe! &lt;3 "
511,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,vvtPJKWUb2g,"Reaching heights of over 100 meters, Californian sequoias tower over Earth’s other estimated 60,000 tree species. Growing in the misty Sierra Nevada mountains, their massive trunks support the  tallest known trees in the world. But even these behemoths seem  to have their limits. No sequoia on record has been able  to grow taller than 130 meters – and many researchers say these  trees won’t beat that cap even if they live for thousands of  years to come. So what exactly is stopping these trees  from growing taller, forever? It all comes down to sap. In order for trees to grow, they need to bring sugars obtained  from photosynthesis and nutrients brought in through the root system to wherever growth is happening. And just like blood circulates in the human body, trees are designed to circulate two kinds of sap throughout their bodies – carrying all the substances a tree’s cells need to live. The first is phloem sap. Containing the sugars generated in  leaves during photosynthesis, phloem sap is thick, like honey, and flows down the plant’s phloem tissue to distribute sugar throughout the tree. By the end of its journey, the phloem sap has thinned  into a watery substance, pooling at the base of the tree. Right beside the phloem is the tree’s other tissue type: the xylem. This tissue is packed with nutrients and ions like calcium, potassium, and iron, which the tree has absorbed through its roots. Here at the tree’s base, there are more of these particles in  one tissue than the other, so the water from the phloem sap is  absorbed into the xylem to correct the balance. This process, called osmotic movement, creates nutrient-rich xylem sap, which will then travel up the trunk to spread those nutrients through the tree. But this journey faces a formidable obstacle: gravity. To accomplish this herculean task, the xylem relies on three forces: transpiration, capillary action, and root pressure. As part of photosynthesis, leaves open and close pores called stomata. These openings allow oxygen and carbon dioxide in and out of the leaf, but they also create an opening through which water evaporates. This evaporation, called transpiration, creates negative pressure in the xylem,  pulling watery xylem sap up the tree. This pull is aided by a fundamental  property of water called capillary action. In narrow tubes, the attraction between water molecules and the adhesive forces between the water and its environment can beat out gravity. This capillary motion is in full effect  in xylem filaments thinner than human hair. And where these two forces pull the sap, the osmotic movement at the tree’s  base creates root pressure, pushing fresh xylem sap up the trunk. Together these forces launch sap to dizzying heights, distributing nutrients, and growing new leaves to photosynthesize – far above the tree’s roots. But despite these sophisticated systems, every centimeter is a fight against gravity. As trees grow taller and taller, the supply of these vital fluids  begins to dwindle. At a certain height, trees can no longer afford the lost water that evaporates during photosynthesis. And without the photosynthesis needed to support additional growth, the tree instead turns its resources towards existing branches. This model, known as the “hydraulic limitation hypothesis,” is currently our best explanation for why trees have limited heights, even in perfect growing conditions. And using this model alongside  growth rates and known needs for nutrients and photosynthesis, researchers have been able to propose height limits for specific species. So far these limits have held up – even the world’s tallest tree still falls  about fifteen meters below the cap. Researchers are still investigating the  possible explanations for this limit, and there may not be one universal  reason why trees stop growing. But until we learn more, the height of trees is yet another way that gravity, literally, shapes life on Earth. "
512,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,vyUnzfMh-zA,"On July 4, 2015, a NASA spacecraft called New Horizons was 5 billion kilometers away from Earth. It was only 10 days away from Pluto, after flying for 9.5 years, when it suddenly dropped out of contact. But let’s back up a little. As of 1989, mankind had successfully sent craft to every known planet in the solar system except one—Pluto. You may have heard that astronomers  don’t consider Pluto or its brethren to be planets. However, most planetary  scientists still do, which is why we're using  that terminology here. There’s a limited amount we can learn about Pluto from Earth because it’s so far from us. Pluto, however, is a scientific goldmine. It’s located in a region called the Kuiper Belt, home to many small planets, hundreds of thousands of ancient icy objects, and trillions of comets. This mysterious region holds clues  to the formation of our solar system, and it was long,  tantalizingly beyond our reach. Until New Horizons. Its objectives: explore Pluto, collect as much scientific  data as possible, transmit it back to Earth, then explore farther out  in the Kuiper Belt. To achieve this, the New Horizons team  outfitted their craft with seven state-of-the-art  scientific instruments. Those included Ralph, a set of cameras powerful enough to capture features the size of city blocks in Manhattan from tens of thousands of kilometers away. And REX, designed to use radio waves to measure Pluto’s atmospheric pressure and temperature. All of the onboard equipment had to be built to be both reliable and lightweight because New Horizons had an additional challenge; it had to reach its target  as fast as possible. Why? Around 2020, Pluto will reach  a point in its orbit where its atmosphere could freeze. And due to the tilt of its axis, more and more of Pluto’s surface  is shrouded in darkness every year. Pluto completes a full orbit once every 248 Earth years, so it would be a long wait  for the next prime opportunity to visit. To see how New Horizons  got to Pluto in time, let’s jump to its launch. Its three rocket stages accelerated  New Horizons to such great speeds that it crossed the 400,000 kilometers  to the moon in just nine hours. About a year later,  the craft reached Jupiter and got what’s called a gravity assist. That’s where it flies close enough to the gas giant to receive a gravitational slingshot effect. New Horizons was then flying  at around 50,000 kilometers per hour, as it would for the next eight years  to cross the remaining gulf to Pluto. Going at such an astonishing speed meant that slowing down to get into orbit or land would’ve been impossible. That’s why New Horizons was on  a flyby mission, where it would get just one chance to scream by Pluto and make its observations. The flyby would have  to be fully automated, since at that distance, any signals  to guide it from Earth would take 4.5 hours to reach it. So the team loaded the ship’s computer with a series of thousands of commands, called the core load, that would begin to execute  when the craft was 6.5 days from Pluto. But when New Horizons  was just ten days out, disaster almost struck. Ground control lost contact  with the spacecraft. After two nerve-wracking hours, New Horizons came back online, but mission control discovered  that its main computer had rebooted, losing the entire core load  and other critical data. Without that, it would soon  whizz by Pluto with virtually nothing to show for the mission. Alice Bowman,  the mission’s Operations Manager, led a team for 72 sleepless hours  to get the instructions loaded back into New Horizons in time. Without room for a single error, she and her team pulled it off, and New Horizons began taking and broadcasting breathtaking images. Those observations have revealed a delightfully varied world, with ground fogs, high altitude hazes, possible clouds, canyons, towering mountains, faults, craters, polar caps, glaciers, apparent dune fields, suspected ice volcanoes, evidence for past flowing liquids, and more. One of the most exciting discoveries is the 1000-kilometer-wide Sputnik Planitia glacier. Sputnik Planitia is mainly composed of slowly churning frozen nitrogen, and we’ve never seen anything like it in our solar system. The exploration of Pluto  was a great success, but New Horizons isn’t done yet. On January 1, 2019, it’ll break its own record for  furthest explored object when it visits a Kuiper Belt Object  called 2014 MU69, which is orbiting the sun another billion kilometers farther away than Pluto. The world is holding its breath  to see what it’ll find there. "

Once again, this spectacular tale will be told by David Crowther from The History of England podcast, and after last week's episode, Zoey and I have been debating all week on who's going to win this epic showdown between Edward and Philip. Not to breach your interest, but why didn't you just research the answer yourselves? Well, Zoey not having opposable thumbs is a bit of a page-turning hindrance for one thing, but more importantly we'd rather hear you but more importantly we'd rather hear you tell us what happens next. Well in that case you do, allow me to fill you in! I think this music is.. Birth of the People? Anyway.. Let's just get to the video. In 1337, Edward and the country of maybe 4 million people, against the most powerful country in Christendom. A country five times it's size. Edward was never to gain a reputation as a stay-at-home kind of lad. He was confident bullish aggressive, a warrior. He would bend the world to his will. Edward had a plan. In a letter to the pope, he wrote the best way to avoid the inconvenience as a war, is to pursue it away from one's own country. It is more sensible for us to fight our notorious enemy in his own realm. Edward would attack. He would follow the strategy of the Chevauchee, French word for raid on horseback He would impose what he called fire and sword on the French countryside Marching on a wide 20-mile front a hideous wave of destruction and death burning and killing everything in their way His ship also would cause enormous economic damage. It would humiliate the opposing Valois King Philip and show Philip subjects He could not protect them and that they should instead choose Edward as their King Philip would be forced to come and fight a set battle where Edward was sure he could win or at least that was the plan England was small and insignificant so Edward started by getting himself some big friends including the Holy Roman Emperor and Holy Roman Emperor did not come cheap, but in 13:39 Edward could march with his army into France head held high banners flying towards glory In fact, his banners were flying towards humiliation and failure. The Holy Roman Emperor liked his gold very much He was less enthusiastic about doing anything for it such as supporting a balmy English loser So he chilled out her home spent a quiet night in with his gold instead Edwards campaign of 1339 went nowhere he's useless allies had cost a fortune and by 1340 Edward had a pile of debt So high he could hang glide off it and he was forced to borrow more and more from Italian banking houses in Gascony the war was going badly worse the French took control of the English Channel with a large well-equipped Fleet against which the English could throw up only merchant ships Edwards councilors his naval captain's and his Nobles told him he could not break the French blockade But Edward was angry and would not listen he snored at his council I will cross and you who are frightened where there is no fear You may stay at home and so in 1340 the King of England Edward the third Against the advice of all his experts attacked a navy almost twice his size Head-on near the town of slice off the coast of Flanders to the amazement of France and all Christendom Edward one 18,000 French sailors lost their lives But whilst loys was a great victory which gave England back control the English Channel success on land still seemed a long way away The only way Edward could get the money he needed to carry on was by Parliament voting him a special tax So Edward went to Parliament to ask for the money the Parliament was tired of the expense of Edward's war and Refused but Edward would not give up in two small battles in Brittany The English achieved stunning victories against absurd odds Edward had two advantages the first was aggression and superior leadership Edward was lucky to gather around him captains of extraordinary ability Walther money a wildly enthusiastic Aggressive and talented tactical commander who would charge into every battle with incredible courage in the battle Cry mani on his lips Henry of Lancaster a cultured man who had write a book called the book of holy medicines Lamenting his misspent youth of wine women and song and advocating the religious life who was also a visionary military Strategist and winner of another absurdly unlikely victory in the South of France the capital de bouche a gas Co was the leading cavalry commander of his age Together these men around Edward would make history The second was that the English had taken the rulebook of medieval military tactics torn it into tiny tiny little pieces rewritten the rules stamped on the tiny pieces of the old rules ground them into the mud and danced on them every Medieval army knew the battles were won by heavily armoured Chivalric aristocratic Knights who sat on horseback and who by the sheer weight of their charge? Irresistible smashed through any opposition but Edward made English Knights fight on foot They did not charge they waited for their enemy then Archers were set on the flanks and between the units of knights all other European Armies used the crossbow because it needed little scale to anybody could be trained to use it English and Welsh archers were armed with the deadly longbow The longbow was a six foot bow of you massively difficult to draw and requiring a life of training from boyhood to use effectively Handily, that's exactly what they had since in all the villages and towns fathers and sons practiced every week The longbow had a longer range than the crossbow hit like a truck and could penetrate all but the best plate armor It had a much faster rate of fire than a crossbow Each longbow could fire a deadly storm of six arrows a minute Edward would teach the French that the most powerful weapon on the battlefield Was a lightly armored lowborn peasant But Edwards cause looked lost his debts were so massive that he defaulted sending to italian banking houses into bankruptcy England had now been fighting for eight years and had very little to show for it And edward could find no one to lend him money were still in 1346 King Philip of France Gathered a massive army and prepared to drive the English out of France once and for all so Edward did the only sane and rational thing when broke a massively outnumbered he spent every last penny he had Raised an army and invaded he landed in Normandy with a small army and a plan He would burn and destroy French countryside as he marched north towards Flanders pulling Philip behind him and then he'd join it with a Flemish army and with the combined Army, turn fight and destroy the French in battle but as he marched north He was in danger of being trapped by the rivers before he could meet the army of Flanders and it was critical that Edward found A way over the river Somme desperately the English marched the French snapping at their heels again And again the Fords and bridges were held against them and then one night as the French were closing in he found an Englishman living In France, and he told them of a secret fort marked by a white stone It was called blanched tack in the dead of night the English slipped over the ford and were away but the next day Disaster the army of Flanders were not coming. The only reasonable thing to do now was to run for the coast England and safety But Edward didn't like to do the reasonable thing and so at a place called Cressy without the Flemish he turned his army to face the French it was time to fight to his son and heir the sixteen year old Edward known to History as the Black Prince he gave command at the left wing as Philip marched his army towards Crecy The roads were lined with French shouting kill kill on the 26th of August 1346 Philips army drew near the English force The French was strung out for miles Phil its best commanders advise caution put on this comfy jim-jams the Queen gave you last Christmas Don the Royal slippers get a goodnights news and everyone catch up send around the English in a river of their own blood After a light breakfast, but Philip look to the puny English army now less than one-third his size He looked at the contemptible English peasants and their bows He heard the cries of kill in his ears and he ordered the attack A wave of crossbowmen came forward to soften the English up with thousands of bolts But before they could get him range the English bent through fired and unleashed a storm the crossbowmen ran or died Furious philip ordered the cream of French chivalry to attack as they thundered towards the English lines They brutally cut down any of their own cross women in the way and the flower of friendship weary started to die even where the finest armor protected them Horses were vulnerable and the chaos and screams of men and horses as the arrows struck home was terrible between waves of attacks English and Welsh archers Sprinted into the field retrieved arrows and thrust daggers into the exposed eyes or necks of the helpless. Fallen French knights but the courage of the French was undeniable the blind King John of Bohemia ordered two of his Companions to tie their horses to his and lead him into the fray All three were found at the end still linked together in death and despite Horrible losses through sheer courage and weight of numbers many French Knights did make it to the English lines finally there They could crush their tormentors, but the tiny contingent of English Knights would not break at one point The young black prince was so hard pressed The one of his commanders begged Edward to send reinforcements ed would turn to his good parenting guide teaching self-reliance section Tell my son this is his chance to win his Spurs The Black Prince was on his own and the Black Prince did not break eventually Edward knew it was time to finish this as the massive French army milled in shock and chaos and pain and confusion the English Knights mounted their horses and leveled their Lance's and the French fled and Europe reeled with shocked at the news the flower of Christendom lay dead in a field of blood slaughtered by English peasants "
514,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,w6EGyFAGpXU,"Hendrix, Cobain and Page. They can all shred, but how exactly do the iconic contraptions in their hands produce notes, rhythm, melody and music. When you pluck a guitar string, you create a vibration called a standing wave. Some points on the string, called nodes, don't move at all, while other points, anti-nodes,  oscillate back and forth. The vibration translates through the neck and bridge to the guitar's body, where the thin and flexible wood vibrates, jostling the surrounding air molecules together and apart. These sequential compressions create sound waves, and the ones inside the guitar mostly escape through the hole. They eventually propagate to your ear, which translates them into electrical impulses that your brain interprets as sound. The pitch of that sound depends on the frequency of the compressions. A quickly vibrating string will cause a lot of compressions close together, making a high-pitched sound, and a slow vibration  produces a low-pitched sound. Four things affect the frequency of a vibrating string: the length, the tension, the density and the thickness. Typical guitar strings  are all the same length, and have similar tension, but vary in thickness and density. Thicker strings vibrate more slowly, producing lower notes. Each time you pluck a string, you actually create  several standing waves. There's the first fundamental wave, which determines the pitch of the note, but there are also waves called overtones, whose frequencies are multiples of the first one. All these standing waves combine to form a complex wave with a rich sound. Changing the way you pluck the string affects which overtones you get. If you pluck it near the middle, you get mainly the fundamental and the odd multiple overtones, which have anti-nodes in the middle of the string. If you pluck it near the bridge, you get mainly even multiple overtones and a twangier sound. The familiar Western scale is based on the overtone series of a vibrating string. When we hear one note played with another that has exactly twice its frequency, its first overtone, they sound so harmonious that we assign them the same letter, and define the difference between them as an octave. The rest of the scale  is squeezed into that octave divided into twelve half steps whose frequency is each 2^(1/12) higher than the one before. That factor determines the fret spacing. Each fret divides the string's remaining length by 2^(1/12), making the frequencies  increase by half steps. Fretless instruments, like violins, make it easier to produce the infinite frequencies between each note, but add to the challenge  of playing intune. The number of strings and their tuning are custom tailored to the chords we like to play and the physiology of our hands. Guitar shapes and materials can also vary, and both change the nature and sound of the vibrations. Playing two or more  strings at the same time allows you to create new wave patterns like chords and other sound effects. For example, when you play two notes whose frequencies are close together, they add together to create a sound wave whose amplitude rises and falls, producing a throbbing effect, which guitarists call the beats. And electric guitars give you  even more to play with. The vibrations still start in the strings, but then they're translated into electrical signals by pickups and transmitted to speakers that create the sound waves. Between the pickups and speakers, it's possible to process  the wave in various ways, to create effects like distortion, overdrive, wah-wah, delay and flanger. And lest you think that the physics  of music is only useful for entertainment, consider this. Some physicists think that everything in the universe is created by the harmonic series of very tiny, very tense strings. So might our entire reality be the extended solo  of some cosmic Jimi Hendrix? Clearly, there's a lot more to strings than meets the ear. "
515,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,wDBb2_I-oC4,"Why are most manhole covers round? Sure, it makes them easy to roll and slide into place in any alignment but there's another more compelling reason involving a peculiar geometric property of circles and other shapes. Imagine a square  separating two parallel lines. As it rotates, the lines first push apart, then come back together. But try this with a circle and the lines stay  exactly the same distance apart, the diameter of the circle. This makes the circle unlike the square, a mathematical shape  called a curve of constant width. Another shape with this property is the Reuleaux triangle. To create one, start with an equilateral triangle, then make one of the vertices the center of a circle that touches the other two. Draw two more circles in the same way, centered on the other two vertices, and there it is, in the space where they all overlap. Because Reuleaux triangles can rotate between parallel lines without changing their distance, they can work as wheels, provided a little creative engineering. And if you rotate one while rolling its midpoint in a nearly circular path, its perimeter traces out a square with rounded corners, allowing triangular drill bits to carve out square holes. Any polygon with an odd number of sides can be used to generate a curve of constant width using the same method we applied earlier, though there are many others that aren't made in this way. For example, if you roll any  curve of constant width around another, you'll make a third one. This collection of pointy curves fascinates mathematicians. They've given us Barbier's theorem, which says that the perimeter  of any curve of constant width, not just a circle, equals pi times the diameter. Another theorem tells us that if you had a bunch of curves of constant width with the same width, they would all have the same perimeter, but the Reuleaux triangle  would have the smallest area. The circle, which is effectively  a Reuleaux polygon with an infinite number of sides, has the largest. In three dimensions, we can make  surfaces of constant width, like the Reuleaux tetrahedron, formed by taking a tetrahedron, expanding a sphere from each vertex until it touches the opposite vertices, and throwing everything away except the region where they overlap. Surfaces of constant width maintain a constant distance between two parallel planes. So you could throw a bunch of Reuleaux tetrahedra on the floor, and slide a board across them as smoothly as if they were marbles. Now back to manhole covers. A square manhole cover's short edge could line up with the wider part of the hole and fall right in. But a curve of constant width won't fall in any orientation. Usually they're circular, but keep your eyes open, and you just might come across a Reuleaux triangle manhole. "
516,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,wKSqgLQNIeQ,"Egypt: 1300 BCE. Laborers toil under the hot desert sun, dismantling a once grand temple. The stone slabs are torn away without regard for their ornate carvings, destined for an inglorious fate as construction fill. Nearby, men break open a pharaoh's burial chamber. And these men are no mere grave robbers, but rather priests and viziers. Their mission? To scratch out all mentions of a certain name: Akhenaten, once Pharaoh of all Egypt and the voice of a god. But what crime, what blasphemy had he committed that would make his own subjects try to  erase him from history? [Music: Birth of the People] As a boy, his name was Amenhotep IV, son of the 9th Pharaoh of Egypt's 18th dynasty. He was the 2nd son and never expected to rule. Only after his brother died suddenly did he become heir. Amenhotep's father was an effective and popular pharaoh whose diplomatic prowess had led Egypt into an era of prosperity and international influence. However, when Amenhotep himself came to the throne, he wasn't overly interested in the duties of leadership, preferring to devote his time to worshipping a new god called Aten. Buuuut, that was a problem! You see, most of Egypt saw Amun, the patron god of Thebes, as their central deity -- not to mention it was the rulers of Thebes who had expelled the foreign kings that had governed Egypt for centuries. It was the rulers of Thebes who had founded the dynasty to which Amenhotep belonged, and it was the rulers of Thebes who had established what we now call Egypt's New Kingdom. And they did all of that under the patronage and banner of the god Amun, Savior of Egypt. Aten, on the other hand, initially started as an aspect of Ra, the Sun God. Rather than a physical form like most Egyptian gods, Aten took the aspect of a solar disk, and while his cult was worshipped, he did not hold the same reverence as Amun did. But for whatever reason, Amenhotep gave his devotion to Aten above all others, and this young pharaoh took no time in displaying that devotion. In his early reign, he preoccupied himself with raising temples to Aten. First at Thebes, then at Karnak (even though those sites had previously been dedicated to Amun). Okay, a little presumptuous, sure. But you know, I mean not a BIG deal, right? I mean the man's Pharaoh after all! But then, in the 5th year of his reign, things started to change. Amenhotep officially changed his name to Akhenaten, and a month later, proclaimed his intentions to build a new capital city named Amarna, dedicated to Aten. And four years of furious construction later, Akhenaten moved his family and court into his still incomplete city. This move wasn't just motivated by religious zeal however. Egypt was a large country with multiple power centers: Thebes in the south was the seat of religious power and Memphis in the north, the cultural center. Akhenaten wanted to consolidate all of that creative and religious power into his new city, not to mention there was another pressing justification for the move. In the stela marking the boundaries of Amarna, there is mention of something that led Akhenaten to fear organized opposition to his rule. See, Atenism hadn't really... caught on in the society at large, and the priesthood of Amun had not taken kindly to the encroachment of Akhenaten's monuments to Aten. And fear of these groups spurred his desire to have an Atenist utopia under his complete control. Secure in his new capital, Akhenaten became increasingly despotic. While initially he was lenient towards other gods, eventually, he went so far as to declare Aten was not just the Supreme God, but the ONLY God. He ordered all mentions of Amun to be scratched out and references to Gods plural changed to God singular. Even mentions of his original name, Amenhotep, were all struck out, and eventually, Akhenaten forbade the worship of Amun entirely, closed all of the gods' temples, and diverted their coffers to building his grand capital. During his reign, soldiers patrolled the streets, citizens took to scratching out the names of rival deities on their possessions, and in his capital, Akhenaten's obsession and hubris only grew. He composed a grand hymn to his patron, positioning Aten as the sole deity and himself as the only intermediary who could speak to the god. He wanted the world to know that Akhenaten alone could channel Aten's divine will. Along with this religious oppression came a bizarre new style of art. Traditionally, the Pharaoh had always been shown in a compact rigid style. But statues of Akhenaten, however, show highly exaggerated features. His head and neck are elongated, with prominent chin and sloping nose and forehead. His body is depicted with wider hips, a more pronounced chest, and a noticeable paunch. Alongside these personal reliefs were also domestic scenes, with his wife Queen Nefertiti and their six daughters. These depict the Pharaoh and his family in quaint scenes, often showing motion and activity, whereas Egyptian art up to that point had mostly consisted of motionless characters in strict poses. And of course, the Sun disk of Aten was also prominently featured in this new style. Now the reasons for this radical artistic change remain unknown, but this shift seems to have been commissioned by Akhenaten himself. Perhaps this style reflected his attempt to wrest political control from the priesthood or portray his view of himself as different from other people. Maybe he wanted to show the human body as imperfect in comparison to the glory of Aten. Or perhaps the relatable scenes of his family were meant to rally public support. But whatever the reason, it didn't matter much, because over time, Akhenaten's obsession with religious policies damaged the country. He neglected matters of state, losing some foreign territory, all while his building programs drained the economy. Wait, you mean to tell me constructing a new capital wasn't cheap? Huh. (－‸ლ) In addition, his plans for consolidating religious, political, and cultural power backfired. Closing the temples to Amun cut off the steady stream of revenue those temples generated for the state, and centralizing power gave his courtiers vast control over Egypt's wealth, leading to unprecedented levels of corruption in his court. And when it was all said and done, Akhenaten died only 17 years after coming to the throne, ruling for less than half of the time of his prosperous father. With Akhenaten's death, the installation of Atenism instantly collapsed. You see, even though people obeyed his decrees mainly out of fear, nobody really gave up the old gods. Ancient Egypt was a civilization characterized by stasis and reluctant change, and while a string of short-lived successors followed, with Akhenaten gone, none of them were really keen to prop up his revolution. So in the end, Atenism was entombed along with the dead Pharaoh, and for the last nail in the proverbial coffin, once on the throne, Akhenaten's own son, Tutankhamun, restored Amun as the supreme deity, continuing the ever-present trend of historical figures sticking it to their pops. But it was the military commander Horemheb, who became the last Pharaoh of the dynasty after a messy power struggle, that fully unraveled Akhenaten's dream. Horemheb ordered temples to Aten demolished and their stone repurposed, and he also divided legal power back between Thebes and Memphis as they had resided before. Finally, he wiped Akhenaten from history, erasing the Pharaoh and his successors from the official list of kings, (Not including Horemheb himself, of course, don't be silly!) All references to Akhenaten were destroyed, much as he himself attempted to do to the old gods decades earlier. His great city of Amarna was abandoned, never to be occupied again, and neither Akhenaten, Nefertiti, or any of his children would be laid to rest in the city's unfinished tombs. So if Horemheb's erasure was a complete success, you're probably thinking, ""How did we even make an episode about this guy!?"" Well, Akhenaten remained lost from history until almost the 20th century, when by chance, a local woman digging in the desert found a cache of over 300 cuneiform tablets detailing the royal correspondence of the lost king, and this discovery led archaeologists to recognize the significance of the ruins at what they now realized was Akhenaten's capital. So was Akhenaten a dictator or a revolutionary dreamer? Perhaps he was just a false prophet, whose obsession led to his own ruin, labeled as a tyrant by his own subjects. No one can know for sure. But, what we do know is that he was one of the first, if not the first, Pharaoh to ever break away from ancient Egypt's rigid traditions, and for this, millennia later, the historian James Henry Breasted decided to give him a new title, one that granted perhaps ignores his faults as a leader, but none-the-less fits him well due to his effort to bring about change to Ancient Egypt's static culture: Akhenaten: the first individual in history.

517,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,wQPArC8NN5o,"Ethic and her robot Hedge agree  to help the resistance leader, Adila, sabotage the art-incinerating  furnace-bots. In exchange, Adila promises to lead them  to the first object of Ethic’s quest, an artifact called the Node of Power. Years ago, there was just one furnace-bot. It had a 0 inside its furnace  and an unknown, randomly generated serial number. Over time, the original self-replicated to produce more identical furnace-bots. Each child inherited the original’s unknown serial number within its furnace, and had a random, unique serial number of its own inscribed on its shell. The second generation of furnace- bots also self-replicated in the same way, always passing their own serial numbers to their offspring’s furnaces. This continued on for many generations. Today, each furnace-bot receives  its orders from its parent. So if Ethic can find the original 0 bot and somehow change its instructions, she could take over  the entire army, all at once. Adila has the perfect solution: a data crystal that she’s been carrying for years, waiting for the right moment  to activate it. It contains a program designed  to gain control of a bot and give it new instructions. But if it’s uploaded to any furnace- bot other than the original, the 0 bot will override  the instructions and destroy the data crystal  in the process. The feeding is just a few minutes away, and there’s only one  chance to get this right. Fortunately, Hedge’s ability  to store data can help. In programming, a piece of information gets  stored in something called a variable. Variables are basically containers that hold onto numbers, words, or other values. How does Ethic program Hedge to find the original 0 bot as quickly as possible? Pause now to figure it out for yourself. Here’s a hint. Programs can be written to have  as many variables as you need, but you can solve this problem  with just one. Hedge can use it to store a serial number and replace it with a new one  as often as he needs. Pause now to figure it out for yourself. A key insight here is that Hedge doesn’t need to map out the entire set of relationships to find the original furnace-bot. If, for example, he gets lucky and picks the original one right away, he’ll be done. But if he starts with any other bot, he can still find a path that leads  straight back to the 0-bot by following a simple set of instructions. To help craft them, let’s first simplify the problem. Let’s say there were only  three furnace-bots; a parent and two children, but you don’t  know which is which. You could have Hedge pick one  at random and look inside its furnace. Now, you know the family tree  looks like this. If the number inside the furnace is a 0,  you’ve found the parent. If not, then no matter  which child you chose, it must have the parent’s serial number in its furnace. So in this scenario, you’re guaranteed to find the parent in one or two moves. In actuality, there are many furnace-bots, and you don’t know how  many generations there are nor what the family tree looks like. But you don’t need to, because Hedge can just keep repeating  the same sequence of actions until he gets to the original. How? With a loop. Hedge can pick any bot at random,  look inside its furnace, and store that serial  number as a variable. Then he’ll begin the following loop that will repeat until the stored variable equals 0, the furnace number of the original bot: 1. Find the bot whose shell serial number  matches the stored number. 2. Look inside its furnace. 3. Store that new number,  overwriting the old one. Once the loop ends, we’ll know  that Hedge has found the 0 bot, so he should upload the control program. So here’s what happens: Hedge only takes 5 repetitions  to find the original: robot 733 has the 0 in its furnace. In a blink of a mechanical eye, the program spreads through the entire  army, and Adila takes control. She has the furnace-bots  give off theatrical bouts of flame to hide the fact that they’re now secretly safe-guarding all of that artistic output. Now that Ethic’s delivered  the furnace-bots, Adila honors her end of the deal. She leads Ethic and Hedge to the location of the first artifact, the Node of Power. There, one thing is immediately clear: they’ll have to steal it. "
518,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,wUEl8KrMz14,"Right now, you're probably sitting down to watch this video and staying seated for a few minutes to view it is probably okay. But the longer you stay put, the more agitated your body becomes. It sits there counting down the moments until you stand up again and take it for a walk. That may sound ridiculous. Our bodies love to sit, right? Not really. Sure, sitting for brief periods can help us recover from stress or recuperate from exercise. But nowadays, our lifestyles make us sit much more than we move around, and our bodies simply aren't built for such a sedentary existence. In fact, just the opposite is true. The human body is built to move, and you can see evidence of that in the way it's structured. Inside us are over 360 joints, and about 700 skeletal muscles that enable easy, fluid motion. The body's unique physical structure gives us the ability to stand up straight against the pull of gravity. Our blood depends on us moving around to be able to circulate properly. Our nerve cells benefit from movement, and our skin is elastic, meaning it molds to our motions. So if every inch of the body is ready and waiting for you to move, what happens when you just don't? Let's start with the backbone of the problem, literally. Your spine is a long structure made of bones and the cartilage discs that sit between them. Joints, muscles and ligaments that are attached to the bones hold it all together. A common way of sitting is with a curved back and slumped shoulders, a position that puts uneven pressure on your spine. Over time, this causes wear and tear in your spinal discs, overworks certain ligaments and joints, and puts strain on muscles that stretch to accommodate  your back's curved position. This hunched shape also shrinks your chest cavity while you sit, meaning your lungs have less space to expand into when you breath. That's a problem because it temporarily limits the amount of oxygen that fills your lungs and filters into your blood. Around the skeleton are the muscles, nerves, arteries and veins that form the body's soft tissue layers. The very act of sitting squashes, pressurizes and compresses, and these more delicate tissues really feel the brunt. Have you ever experienced numbness and swelling in your limbs when you sit? In areas that are the most compressed, your nerves, arteries and veins can become blocked, which limits nerve signaling, causing the numbness, and reduces blood flow in your limbs, causing them to swell. Sitting for long periods also temporarily deactivates lipoprotein lipase, a special enzyme in the walls of blood capillaries that breaks down fats in the blood, so when you sit, you're not burning fat nearly as well as when you move around. What effect does all of this stasis have on the brain? Most of the time,  you probably sit down to use your brain, but ironically, lengthy periods of sitting actually run counter to this goal. Being stationary reduces blood flow and the amount of oxygen entering your blood stream through your lungs. Your brain requires both of those things to remain alert, so your concentration levels will most likely dip as your brain activity slows. Unfortunately, the ill effects of being seated don't only exist in the short term. Recent studies have found that sitting for long periods is linked with some types of cancers and heart disease and can contribute to diabetes, kidney and liver problems. In fact, researchers  have worked out that, worldwide, inactivity causes about 9% of premature deaths a year. That's over 5 million people. So what seems like such a harmless habit actually has the power to change our health. But luckily, the solutions to this mounting threat are simple and intuitive. When you have no choice but to sit, try switching the slouch  for a straighter spine, and when you don't have to be bound to your seat, aim to move around much more, perhaps by setting a reminder to yourself to get up every half hour. But mostly, just appreciate that bodies are built for motion, not for stillness. In fact, since the video's almost over, why not stand up and stretch right now? Treat your body to a walk. It'll thank you later. "
519,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,wUVvTqvjUaM,"It was the largest contiguous land  empire in history— stretching from Korea to Ukraine and  from Siberia to southern China, and was forged on the open plains. In the 12th century CE, before the Mongol Empire formed, the East Asian steppe was home to scattered groups of Mongol and Turkic pastoral nomads led by Khans. The people herded sheep, cattle,  yaks and camels. They lived in felt tents and moved between summer and winter campsites. Nomadic women held significant authority,  managing these migrations, many of the flocks and trade. Meanwhile, men specialized in  mounted warfare. These nomadic groups often  fought each other. That was to change under Temujin, who was born into an aristocratic Mongol family. Despite losing his father at an early age  and growing up in poverty, he quickly rose to power by forging  strategic alliances with other leaders. Unlike those khans, Temujin promoted  soldiers based on merit and distributed spoils evenly  among them. His most brilliant move was to scatter  the nomads he conquered among his own soldiers so they couldn't  join together against him. These innovations made him unstoppable, and by 1206, he had united the people of the felt-walled tents and become Chinggis Khan. The Mongols were shamanists, believing that the spirits of nature  and their ancestors inhabited the world around them. Over all arched the Sky god Tenggeri. Chinggis Khan believed that Tenggeri  wanted him to conquer the entire world in his name. With the nomads of the Mongolian  plain united, this seemed within reach. Anyone who resisted the Mongols was resisting Tenggeri's will, and for this insubordination, had to die. Under Chinggis Khan, the Mongols first subdued northern China and the eastern Islamic lands. After his death in 1227, the Divine Mandate passed to his family,  or the Golden Lineage. In the 1230s, Chinggis Khan's sons  and daughters conquered the Turks of Central Asia  and the Russian princes, then destroyed two European  armies in 1241. In the 1250s, the Mongols seized Islamic  territory as far as Baghdad, while in the East their grasp reached southern China by 1279. Life within the Mongol Empire wasn't just  war, pillage and destruction. Once the Mongols conquered a territory, they left its internal politics alone and used local administrators to  govern for them. The Mongols let all religions flourish,  as long as the leaders prayed for them. Although they routinely captured artisans, scholars and engineers, they appreciated what those  specialists could do and forcibly settled them across Asia  to continue their work. The most valuable produce in  the Empire was gold brocade, which took silk from China, gold from  Tibet and weavers from Baghdad. Gold brocade clothed the Mongol rulers,  covered their horses and lined their tents. The Mongols particularly prized gunpowder technicians from China. With much of Eurasia politically unified, trade flourished along the Silk Road, helped by an extensive system of horse messengers and relay posts. Robust trade continued at sea, especially in blue-and-white porcelain, which combined white pottery from Mongol China with blue dye from Mongol Iran. But this was not to last. Succession to the Great Khan didn't  automatically go to the eldest son, but rather allowed brothers, uncles and  cousins to vie for leadership with senior widows acting as  regents for their sons. By the 1260s, Chinggis Khan's grandsons were in a full- blown civil war over inheritance and fragmented the realm into  four separate empires. In China, Kublai Khan's Yuan Dynasty is remembered as a golden age of science and culture. In Iran, the Ilkhanate inaugurated  the development of new monumental architecture and  Persian miniature painting. In Central Asia, the Chagatai Khanate  brought forth leaders like Timur and his descendant Babur, who founded  the Mughal Empire in India. And in Eastern Europe,  the Golden Horde ruled for years until a trading post named Muscovy grew  into a major world power. Even though the Empire lasted  only a short while, the Mongols left a legacy of world- domination that remains unmatched today. "

Thus begins ""The Trial,"" one of author Franz Kafka's most well-known novels. K, the protagonist,  is arrested out of nowhere and made to go through a bewildering process where neither the cause of his arrest, nor the nature of the judicial proceedings are made clear to him. This sort of scenario is considered so characteristic of Kafka's work that scholars came up  with a new word for it. Kafkaesque has entered the vernacular to describe unnecessarily complicated and frustrating experiences, like being forced to navigate labyrinths of bureaucracy. But does standing in a long line to fill out confusing paperwork really capture the richness  of Kafka's vision? Beyond the word's casual use, what makes something Kafkaesque? Franz Kafka's stories do indeed deal with many mundane and absurd aspects of modern bureaucracy, drawn in part from his experience of working as an insurance clerk in early 20th century Prague. Many of his protagonists  are office workers compelled to struggle through a web of obstacles in order to achieve their goals, and often the whole ordeal turns out to be so disorienting and illogical that success becomes pointless in the first place. For example, in the short story,  ""Poseidon,"" the Ancient Greek god is an executive so swamped with paperwork that he's never had time to explore his underwater domain. The joke here is that not even a god can handle the amount of paperwork demanded by the modern workplace. But the reason why is telling. He's unwilling to delegate any of the work because he deems everyone else unworthy of the task. Kafka's Poseidon is a prisoner of his own ego. This simple story contains  all of the elements that make for a truly Kafkaesque scenario. It's not the absurdity of bureaucracy alone, but the irony of the character's circular reasoning in reaction to it that is emblematic of Kafka's writing. His tragicomic stories act as a form of mythology for the modern industrial age, employing dream logic to explore the relationships between systems of arbitrary power and the individuals caught up in them. Take, for example, Kafka's  most famous story, ""Metamorphosis."" When Gregor Samsa awaken's one morning to find himself transformed into a giant insect, his greatest worry  is that he gets to work on time. Of course, this proves impossible. It was not only the authoritarian realm of the workplace that inspired Kafka. Some of his protagonists' struggles come from within. The short story, ""A Hunger Artist,"" describes a circus performer whose act consists of extended fasts. He's upset that the circus master limits these to 40 days, believing this prevents him from achieving greatness in his art. But when his act loses popularity, he is left free  to starve himself to death. The twist comes when he lays dying in anonymity, regretfully admitting that his art has always been a fraud. He fasted not through strength of will, but simply because he never found a food he liked. Even in ""The Trial,"" which seems to focus directly on bureaucracy, the vague laws and bewildering procedures point to something far more sinister: the terrible momentum of the legal system proves unstoppable, even by supposedly powerful officials. This is a system that doesn't serve justice, but whose sole function  is to perpetuate itself. What political theorist Hannah Arendt, writing years after Kafka's death, would call ""tyranny without a tyrant."" Yet accompanying the bleakness of Kafka's stories, there's a great deal of humor rooted in the nonsensical logic of the situations described. So on the one hand, it's easy to recognize the Kafkaesque in today's world. We rely on increasingly convoluted systems of administration that have real consequences on every aspect of our lives. And we find our every word judged by people we can't see according to rules we don't know. On the other hand, by fine-tuning our attention to the absurd, Kafka also reflects our shortcomings back at ourselves. In doing so, he reminds us that the world we live in is one we create, and have the power  to change for the better. "
521,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,wteUW2sL7bc,"Imagine an airplane flying one millimeter above the ground and circling the Earth once every 25 seconds while counting every blade of grass. Shrink all that down so that it fits in the palm of your hand, and you'd have something equivalent to a modern hard drive, an object that can likely hold more information than your local library. So how does it store so much information in such a small space? At the heart of every hard drive is a stack of high-speed spinning discs with a recording head  flying over each surface. Each disc is coated with a film of microscopic magnetised metal grains, and your data doesn't live there in a form you can recognize. Instead, it is recorded  as a magnetic pattern formed by groups of those tiny grains. In each group, also known as a bit, all of the grains have  their magnetization's aligned in one of two possible states, which correspond to zeroes and ones. Data is written onto the disc by converting strings of bits into electrical current fed through an electromagnet. This magnet generates a field strong enough to change the direction of the metal grain's magnetization. Once this information is written onto the disc, the drive uses a magnetic reader to turn it back into a useful form, much like a phonograph needle translates a record's grooves into music. But how can you get so much information out of just zeroes and ones? Well, by putting lots of them together. For example, a letter is represented in one byte, or eight bits, and your average photo  takes up several megabytes, each of which is 8 million bits. Because each bit must be written onto a physical area of the disc, we're always seeking to increase the disc's areal density, or how many bits can be squeezed into one square inch. The areal density of a modern hard drive is about 600 gigabits per square inch, 300 million times greater than that of IBM's first hard drive from 1957. This amazing advance in storage capacity wasn't just a matter of making everything smaller, but involved multiple innovations. A technique called the thin film lithography process allowed engineers to shrink the reader and writer. And despite its size, the reader became more sensitive by taking advantage of new discoveries in magnetic and quantum properties of matter. Bits could also be packed closer together thanks to mathematical algorithms that filter out noise from magnetic interference, and find the most likely bit sequences from each chunk of read-back signal. And thermal expansion control of the head, enabled by placing a heater under the magnetic writer, allowed it to fly less than five nanometers above the disc's surface, about the width of two strands of DNA. For the past several decades, the exponential growth in computer storage capacity and processing power has followed a pattern known as Moore's Law, which, in 1975, predicted that information density would double every two years. But at around 100 gigabits per square inch, shrinking the magnetic grains further or cramming them closer together posed a new risk called the superparamagnetic effect. When a magnetic grain volume is too small, its magnetization is easily disturbed by heat energy and can cause bits to switch unintentionally, leading to data loss. Scientists resolved this limitation in a remarkably simple way: by changing the direction of recording from longitudinal to perpendicular, allowing areal density to approach one terabit per square inch. Recently, the potential limit has been increased yet again through heat assisted magnetic recording. This uses an even more thermally stable recording medium, whose magnetic resistance  is momentarily reduced by heating up a particular spot  with a laser and allowing data to be written. And while those drives are currently in the prototype stage, scientists already have the next potential trick up their sleeves: bit-patterned media, where bit locations are arranged in separate, nano-sized structures, potentially allowing for areal densities of twenty terabits per square inch or more. So it's thanks to the combined efforts of generations of engineers, material scientists, and quantum physicists that this tool of incredible power and precision can spin in the palm of your hand. "
522,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,wujEE3PRVUo,"If you're ever walking down the street and come across an oddly stretched out image, like this, you'll have an opportunity to see something remarkable, but only if you stand in exactly the right spot. That happens because these works employ a technique called anamorphosis. Anamorphosis is a special case of perspective art, where artists represent realistic three-dimensional views on two-dimensional surfaces. Though it's common today, this kind of perspective drawing has only been around since the Italian Renaissance. Ancient art often showed all figures on the same plane, varying in size by symbolic importance. Classical Greek and Roman artists realized they could make objects seem further by drawing them smaller, but many early attempts at perspective were inconsistent or incorrect. In 15th century Florence, artists realized the illusion  of perspective could be achieved with higher degrees of sophistication by applying mathematical principles. In 1485, Leonardo da Vinci manipulated the mathematics to create the first known  anamorphic drawing. A number of other artists later picked up the technique, including Hans Holbein in ""The Ambassadors."" This painting features a distorted shape that forms into a skull as the viewer approaches from the side. In order to understand how artists achieve that effect, we first have to understand how  perspective drawings work in general. Imagine looking out a window. Light bounces off objects  and into your eye, intersecting the window along the way. Now, imagine you could paint the image you see directly onto the window while standing still and keeping only one eye open. The result would be nearly indistinguishable from the actual view with your brain adding depth to the 2-D picture, but only from that one spot. Standing even just a bit off to the side would make the drawing  lose its 3-D effect. Artists understand that  a perspective drawing is just a projection onto a 2-D plane. This allows them to use math to come up with basic rules of perspective that allow them to draw without a window. One is that parallel lines, like these, can only be drawn as parallel if they're parallel to the plane of the canvas. Otherwise, they need to be drawn converging to a common point known as the vanishing point. So that's a standard perspective drawing. With an anamorphic drawing, like ""The Ambassadors,"" directly facing the canvas makes the image look stretched and distorted, but put your eye in exactly the right spot way off to the side, and the skull materializes. Going back to the window analogy, it's as if the artist painted onto a window positioned at an angle instead of straight on, though that's not how Renaissance artists actually created anamorphic drawings. Typically, they draw a normal image  onto one surface, then use a light, a grid, or even strings to project it onto a canvas at an angle. Now let's say you want to make an anamorphic sidewalk drawing. In this case, you want to create the illusion that a 3-D image has been added seamlessly into an existing scene. You can first put a window in front of the sidewalk and draw what you want to add  onto the window. It should be in the same perspective as the rest of the scene, which might require the use of those basic rules of perspective. Once the drawing's complete, you can use a projector placed  where your eye was to project your drawing down  onto the sidewalk, then chalk over it. The sidewalk drawing  and the drawing on the window will be nearly indistinguishable from that point of view, so viewers' brains will again be tricked into believing that the drawing on the ground is three-dimensional. And you don't have to project onto a flat surface to create this illusion. You can project onto multiple surfaces, or assemble a jumble of objects, that from the right point of view, appears to be something else entirely. All over the planet, you can find solid surfaces giving way to strange, wonderful, or terrifying visions. From your sidewalk  to your computer screen, these are just some of the ways that math and perspective can open up whole new worlds. "
523,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,wxzc_2c6GMg,"Which of these has  the least carbohydrates? This roll of bread? This bowl of rice? Or this can of soda? It's a trick question. Although they may differ in fats, vitamins, and other nutritional content, when it comes to carbs, they're pretty much the same. So what exactly does that mean for your diet? First of all, carbohydrate is the nutritional category for sugars and molecules that your body breaks down to make sugars. Carbohydrates can be simple or complex depending on their structure. This is a simple sugar, or monosaccharide. Glucose, fructose,  and galactose are all simple sugars. Link two of them together, and you've got a disaccharide, lactose, maltose, or sucrose. Complex carbohydrates, on the other hand, have three or more simple sugars strung together. Complex carbohydrates with three to ten linked sugars are oligosaccharides. Those with more than ten are polysaccharides. During digestion, your body breaks down those complex carbohydrates into their monosaccharide building blocks, which your cells can use for energy. So when you eat  any carbohydrate-rich food, the sugar level in your blood, normally about a teaspoon, goes up. But your digestive tract doesn't respond to all carbohydrates the same. Consider starch and fiber, both polysaccharides, both derived from plants, both composed of hundreds to thousands of monosaccharides joined together, but they're joined together differently, and that changes the effect  they have on your body. In starches, which plants mostly store for energy in roots and seeds, glucose molecules are joined together by alpha linkages, most of which can be easily cleaved by enzymes in your digestive tract. But in fiber, the bonds between monosaccharide molecules are beta bonds, which your body can't break down. Fiber can also trap some starches, preventing them from being cleaved, resulting in something called resistant starch. So foods high in starch, like crackers and white bread, are digested easily, quickly releasing a whole bunch of glucose into your blood, exactly what would happen if you drank something high in glucose, like soda. These foods have a high glycemic index, the amount that a particular food raises the sugar level in your blood. Soda and white bread have a similar glycemic index because they have a similar effect on your blood sugar. But when you eat foods high in fiber, like vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, those indigestible beta bonds slow  the release of glucose into the blood. Those foods have a lower glycemic index, and foods like eggs, cheese, and meats have the lowest glycemic index. When sugar moves from the digestive tract to the blood stream, your body kicks into action to transfer it into your tissues where it can be processed  and used for energy. Insulin, a hormone  synthesized in the pancreas, is one of the body's main tools for sugar management. When you eat and your blood sugar rises, insulin is secreted into the blood. It prompts your muscle and fat cells to let glucose in and jump starts the conversion of sugar to energy. The degree to which a unit of insulin lowers the blood sugar helps us understand something called insulin sensitivity. The more a given unit of insulin lowers blood sugar, the more sensitive you are to insulin. If insulin sensitivity goes down, that's known as insulin resistance. The pancreas still sends out insulin, but cells, especially muscle cells, are less and less responsive to it, so blood sugar fails to decrease, and blood insulin continues to rise. Chronically consuming  a lot of carbohydrates may lead to insulin resistance, and many scientists believe that insulin resistance leads to a serious condition called metabolic syndrome. That involves a constellation of symptoms, including high blood sugar, increased waist circumference, and high blood pressure. It increases the risk  of developing conditions, like cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes. And its prevalence is rapidly increasing all over the world. As much as 32% of the population in the U.S. has metabolic syndrome. So let's get back to your diet. Whether your food tastes sweet or not, sugar is sugar, and too many carbs can be a problem. So maybe you'll want to take a pass on that pasta sushi roll pita burrito donut burger sandwich. "
524,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,xYxyTZG7APQ,"Just now, somewhere in the universe, a star exploded. There goes another one. In fact, a supernova occurs every second or so in the observable universe, and there is one on average every 25 to 50 years in a galaxy the size and age of the Milky Way. Yet we've never actually been able to watch one happen from its first violent moments. Of course, how would we? There are hundreds of billions of stars close enough that we could watch the supernova explosion break through the surface of the star. But we'd have to have our best telescopes focused on the right one at precisely the right time to get meaningful data. Suffice it to say, the odds of that happening are astronomically low. But what if we could anticipate  a supernova before its light reached us? That may seem impossible. After all, nothing travels faster than the speed of light, right? As far as we know, yes. But in a race, fast doesn't matter if you take a detour while someone else beelines it for the finish line. For exactly that reason, photons don't win  the supernova race to Earth. Neutrinos do. Here's why. There are two types of supernova. Type 1 is when a star accumulates so much matter from a neighboring star, that a runaway nuclear reaction ignites and causes it to explode. In type 2, the star runs out  of nuclear fuel, so the gravitational forces pulling in overwhelm the quantum mechanical forces pushing out, and the stellar core collapses under its own weight in a hundredth of a second. While the outer reaches of the star are unaffected by the collapsed core, the inner edges accelerate through the void, smash into the core, and rebound to launch the explosion. In both of these scenarios, the star expels an unparalleled amount of energy, as well as a great deal of matter. In fact, all atoms heavier than nickel, including elements like gold and silver, only form in supernova reactions. In type 2 supernovae, about 1% of the energy  consists of photons, which we know of as light, while 99% radiates out as neutrinos, the elementary particles that are known for rarely interacting with anything. Starting from the center of the star, the exploding matter takes tens of minutes, or even hours, or in rare cases, several days, to reach and break through the surface of the star. However, the neutrinos, thanks to their non-interactivity, take a much more direct route. By the time there is any visible change in the star's suface, the neutrinos typically have a several hour head start over the photons. That's why astronomers and physicists have been able to set up a project called SNEWS, the Supernova Early Warning System. When detectors around the world pick up bursts of neutrinos, they send messages to a central computer in New York. If multiple detectors receive similar signals within ten seconds, SNEWS will trigger an alert warning that a supernova is imminent. Aided by some distance and direction information from the neutrino detectors, the amateur astronomers and scientists alike will scan the skies and share information to quickly identify  the new galactic supernova and turn the world's major telescopes in that direction. The last supernova that sent detectable neutrinos to Earth was in 1987 on the edge of the Tarantula Nebula in the large Magellanic Cloud, a nearby galaxy. Its neutrinos reached Earth about three hours ahead of the visible light. We're due for another one any day now, and when that happens, SNEWS should give you the opportunity to be among the first to witness something that no human has ever seen before. "
525,Education,27,UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg | Extra Credits,x_M2LX980Aw,"All of Simón's hopes were pinned to his great conference It was going to be like the amphictyonic league that had once, centuries ago, brought all the greeks together in a common confederation, a common understanding of, who they were. The most common phrase used today to describe the Congress of Panama is: A reasounding failure. Bolívar decided not to attend the Congress of Panama. Too many rumors were already circulating about him wanting to make himself a king and he wanted to show that the congress was completely free of his influence but unfortunately Bolívar influence was the only thing still holding this fragile idea of a pan-american league together. The Peruvians long felt that he had overstayed his welcome in their country, and they wanted nothing to do with joining Gran Colombia. Brazil was a monarchy, and so wanted nothing to do with these fledgling republics. Argentina was terrified of being steamrolled by Gran Colombia, and so wanted nothing to do with the congress in general. And the Bolivian delegates, they just didn't make it there in time. Worse still, Bolívar's vice president Santander, The man he had left in charge of Gran Colombia, had now been running Gran Colombia for so long, that he chaffed at the idea of Bolívar reasserting himself over the country that he'd essentially abandoned. So even Santander was no help in forwarding Bolívar's cause at all. But even as the congress fell appart, more bad news was on the way. While he was still in Peru, a plot on Bolívar's life was uncovered. The plan was to kill Bolívar and expel all Colombians from the country, reasserting Peru as it's own state. Bolívar responded swiftly, exiling or executing those involved. But while history largely sees these sentences as justified, they did nothing to win him popularity in Peru. Then, another misfortune struck. One of Bolívar's most trusted generals, Paez, the man who had led his cavalry, who had inspired the plainsmen, who had been instrumental in winning bolivar the war, rebelled. But his rebellion was an odd one. He rebelled for Bolívar. He called Venezuela to break from Gran Colombia, and shake of the rules of Santander, the vice president that Bolívar had left in Bogata. And so now Bolívar had both his general, Paez, and his vice-president, Santander, begging for him to return with his army and help him crush the other guy. For the sake of the revolution. So, Bolívar returned to Gran Colombia, not to take sides, but to heal the breach, and that he did, for a little while. Because even his enemies said that, when they were with him, they could not help but love him. It was like a spell, the guy had charisma in spades. All their grievances melted before his energy and open arms. But as soon as he was out of sight, all those enmities would spring up again. And his health was not what it once was, he was now gaunt, skeletal, eaten by consumption, the very disease that had taken his parents. But, he was never one to quit. And so he took back up the mantel of power in Gran Colombia. But his dictatorial ways isolated him more and more. And as he travelled the countryside he saw the true effects of his revolution, of his republic. He saw a wasteland with roads destroyed, crops untended. The populus that he had freed were worse of now than when he stood outside of Rome so many years ago. And, when he tried to do anything about it he was met time and again with one unasailable fact: The countries treasury was empty. Santander had even negotiated a huge loan from the british to help keep the government afloat, but that loan was already gone, under whispers of corruption and mismanagement. More even than corruption though, there was one all  consuming source that had swallowed up the money: and that was the army. For years now, Gran Colombia had essentially footed the bill for Bolívar to gallivant through Spanish America liberating country after country. Revolutions aren't cheap, and Gran Colombia had just paid for at least six. Now the people of Gran Colombia strained against that yoke. But Bolívar, beset on all sides by news of military setbacks, felt that he couldn't shrink the military right now. Peru had not only broken from the federation, but invaded what was to become Ecuador. Bolivia was in turmoil, and close to being lost. There were even insurections in the heart of Gran Colombia. How could he risk reducing the army at this critical time? But it was the revolt of Peru that really tore a rift between Bolívar and his vice-president Santander. Santander practically cheered the loss of Peru. Not having to garrison such a large and quarrel less state would save the government a fortune. But Bolívar saw Santander's reaction as a shot in the back. He saw Santander celebrating something which would ruin his grand project of a universal Spanish-American federation. He even began to suspect that Santander might have aided the rebellion. Bolívar was in the field when he got the news about Peru. Tensions flared, and things escalated. Santander abrogated the dictatorial powers that Bolívar had been given, and in response, Bolívar, the champion of democracy, turned his army around and began to march on Bogota. The very first capital he had liberated. Surprisingly, when he got there no blood was shed. An uneasy peace was formed, with the vice-president still serving his office, but one thing was clear to Bolívar. The constitution of Gran Colombia, one so different than the one he had penned for his beloved Bolivia, was the problem. It kept getting in the way. It preventing him from doing what needed to be done. So he called for a great convention to rewrite the constitution. But, again, with his imperialists march of the army against the capital of a country whose democracy he was supposed to defend, there were whispered charges of monarchism. Everyone said that Bolívar, like Napoleon, would try to give himself a crown. So Bolívar tried to remain hands off. He wouldn't attend the convention, he didn't even seem to lobby that hard for anything other than the convention simply taking place. The voting for the delegates came in. Santander had campaigned vigorously, and his men were elected in a landslide. In the end, Bolívar only stayed in power because his delegates walked out, leaving the convention with one man less than the quorum they needed to hold a vote. He was forced to sabotage the very convention he'd set up. And in this moment, you get a sense of great sorrow. You see a man who recognized how far he had strayed from those ideals he lived for. But at the same time you get a sense of a man who feels trapped, who feels compelled to take each individual action, even though each one is yet one more step away from his own desires. And so, with the convention in tatters, Bolívar once again took on complete dictatorial powers, abandoning all pretense of rule by republic. And the assassination attempts started to role in. More than once, he was saved by his mistress, but his list of friends and comrades had dwindled to a poultry few. Some had died in his wars. Some had retired, done with public life. Some he had alienated, and some in the end, he had to put to the firing squad. Now one more from that list rebelled. The idea of a Latin-American monarchy was pitched. And again, though he had not been directly connected with it, Bolívar was accused of looking to make himself king. With a heavy heart, one of his loyalest generals decided that there would be no peace for the nation, so long as there was Bolívar. And so, once again, Bolívar picked up the sword. Where once, he had spent hours in the saddle, he could now only spend an hour or two at a time before was wracked with coughing, But, though well past the vigor of his youth, eaten from the inside out by consumption, Bolívar still remained active, trying to manage the military and the affairs of states. But as another former friend met his death before his armies on the battlefield, Bolívar knew time was up. His health was failing. He would not live much longer. Of this he was accutely aware. He was reduced to ruin, declared an enemy in many of the states he'd helped to free, and even banned from much of Venezuela, his homeland. His great dream was crumbling around him, one by one, all the states of Spanish America were abandoning his great project. Gran Colombia was disintegrating around him, and there was nothing he could do, frail skeleton of a man that he'd become. So one last time, he tried to put affairs in order, to leave some part of the world that he tried to free ready for a world without him. He called together all the notable men of the revolution that were left, and asked them to oversee the transition of power. To help keep the country together while he retired quietly back to europe, which he had not seen since his youth. But even this was not to be. The Government wouldn't let him go until new elections were held, and he was destitute. He sold his silverware in order to try to afford the trip. When the new ellections were held, the man that he'd asked all those great nobles to let be his successor, didn't win. And so, Bolívar slunk out of Bogota, to make the arduous trip to Cartahena. But even the very ship he was to leave on ran aground. And so he sat, exiled in his own homeland, slowly wasting away like the nation he'd founded. After one last short trip, he died. Not on the battlefield, not with fanfare or ceremony, but of a lung rotting from inside out. He had not left behind order. He had not left behind a single unified state. He had not left behind a lasting constitution or an enlightened code of laws. But, he had left behind liberty. He was the libertador. "
526,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,xfZhb6lmxjk,"It's often said that despite  humanity's many conflicts, we all bleed the same blood. It's a nice thought but not quite accurate. In fact, our blood comes  in a few different varieties. Our red blood cells contain a protein called hemoglobin that binds to oxygen, allowing the cells to transport it throughout the body. But they also have another kind of complex protein on the outside of the cell membrane. These proteins, known as antigens, communicate with white blood cells, immune cells that protect against infection. Antigens serve as identifying markers, allowing the immune system to recognize your body's own cells without attacking them as foreign bodies. The two main kinds of antigens, A and B, determine your blood type. But how do we get four blood types from only two antigens? Well, the antigens are coded for by three different alleles, varieties of a particular gene. While the A and B alleles code for A and B antigens, the O allele codes for neither, and because we inherit one copy of each gene from each parent, every individual has two alleles determining blood type. When these happen to be different, one overrides the other  depending on their relative dominance. For blood types, the A and B alleles are both dominant, while O is recessive. So A and A gives you type A blood, while B and B gives you type B. If you inherit one of each, the resulting codominance will produce both A and B antigens, which is type AB. The O allele is recessive, so either of the others will override it when they're paired, resulting in either type A or type B. But if you happen to inherit two Os, instructions will be expressed that make blood cells without the A or the B antigen. Because of these interactions, knowing both parents' blood types lets us predict the relative probability of their children's blood types. Why do blood types matter? For blood transfusions, finding the correct one is a matter of life and death. If someone with type A blood is given type B blood, or vice versa, their antibodies will reject  the foreign antigens and attack them, potentially causing  the transfused blood to clot. But because people with type AB blood produce both A and B antigens, they don't make antibodies against them, so they will recognize either as safe, making them universal recipients. On the other hand, people with blood type O do not produce either antigen, which makes them universal donors, but will cause their immune system to make antibodies that reject any other blood type. Unfortunately, matching donors and recipients is a bit more complicated due to additional antigen systems, particular the Rh factor, named after the Rhesus monkeys in which it was first isolated. Rh+ or Rh- refers to the presence or absence of the D antigen of the Rh blood group system. And in addition to impeding  some blood transfusions, it can cause severe complications in pregnancy. If an Rh- mother is carrying an Rh+ child, her body will produce Rh antibodies that may cross the placenta and attack the fetus, a condition known as hemolytic disease of the newborn. Some cultures believe blood type to be associated with personality, though this is not  supported by science. And though the proportions of different blood types vary between human populations, scientists aren't sure why they evolved; perhaps as protection  against blood born diseases, or due to random genetic drift. Finally, different species have different sets of antigens. In fact, the four main blood types shared by us apes seem paltry in comparison to the thirteen types found in dogs. "
527,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,xjcsrU-ZmgY,"At a Maryland country fair in 2017, the prize pigs were not looking their best. Farmers reported feverish hogs with inflamed eyes and running snouts. But while fair officials worried about the pigs, the Maryland department of health was concerned about a group of sick fairgoers. Some had pet the pigs, while others had  merely been near their barns; but soon, 40 of these attendees would  be diagnosed with swine flu. More often than not, sick animals  don’t infect humans. But when they do, these cross-species infections, or viral host jumps, have the potential to produce deadly epidemics. So how can pathogens from one species  infect another, and what makes host jumps so dangerous? Viruses are a type of organic parasite infecting nearly all forms of life. To survive and reproduce, they must move through three stages: contact with a susceptible host, infection and replication, and transmission to other individuals. As an example, let’s look  at human influenza. First, the flu virus encounters a new host and makes its way into  their respiratory tract. This isn’t so difficult, but to survive  in this new body, the virus must mount a successful  infection before it’s caught and broken down by an immune response. To accomplish this task, viruses have evolved specific interactions with their host species. Human flu viruses are covered in proteins adapted to bind with matching receptors  on human respiratory cells. Once inside a cell, the virus employs  additional adaptations to hijack the host cell’s reproductive  machinery and replicate its own genetic material. Now the virus only needs to suppress or evade the host’s immune system long enough to replicate to sufficient levels and infect more cells. At this point, the flu can be passed on to its next victim via any transmission  of infected bodily fluid. However, this simple sneeze also brings  the virus in contact with pets, plants, or even your lunch. Viruses are constantly encountering new species and attempting to infect them. More often than not, this ends in failure. In most cases, the genetic dissimilarity  between the two hosts is too great. For a virus adapted to infect humans, a lettuce cell would be a foreign and inhospitable landscape. But there are a staggering number of viruses circulating in the environment, all with the potential to encounter new hosts. And because viruses rapidly reproduce  by the millions, they can quickly develop random mutations. Most mutations will have no effect, or even prove detrimental; but a small proportion may enable the pathogen to better infect a new species. The odds of winning this destructive genetic lottery increase over time, or if the new species is closely related to the virus’ usual host. For a virus adapted to another mammal, infecting a human might just take  a few lucky mutations. And a virus adapted to chimpanzees, one of our closest genetic relatives, might barely require any changes at all. It takes more than time and genetic similarity for a host jump to be successful. Some viruses come equipped to easily  infect a new host’s cells, but are then unable to evade  an immune response. Others might have a difficult time  transmitting to new hosts. For example, they might make the host’s  blood contagious, but not their saliva. However, once a host jump reaches  the transmission stage, the virus becomes much more dangerous. Now gestating within two hosts, the pathogen has twice the odds of  mutating into a more successful virus. And each new host increases  the potential for a full-blown epidemic. Virologists are constantly looking for  mutations that might make viruses such as influenza more likely to jump. However, predicting the next potential  epidemic is a major challenge. There’s a huge diversity of viruses  that we’re only just beginning to uncover. Researchers are tirelessly studying the  biology of these pathogens. And by monitoring populations to quickly identify new outbreaks, they can develop vaccines and containment protocols to stop these deadly diseases. "
528,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,xmNzUEmFZMg,"Why do humans drink so much milk? And given that all mammals lactate, why do we favor certain types of milk over others? Milk is the first thing we drink, and thanks to developments in the production and variety of dairy products, it can take on countless forms for our dietary and sensory well-being. Milk's primary function is as a complete source of nutrition for newborns. In fact, since it has all of the vital nutrients for development and growth, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals, and water, milk is the only thing a baby even needs to ingest for the first six months of life. The unique makeup of milk can vary depending on factors like species, diet, and location. Reindeer of the Arctic Circle,  for example, make energy-dense milk  that's about 20% fat, roughly five times more than human or cow's milk, to help their young survive the harsh, freezing climate. So how is milk made? In the uniquely mammalian process of lactation, a special class of milk-secreting cells known as mammocytes line up in a single layer around pear-shaped alveoli. Those cells absorb all of the building blocks of milk, then synthesize tiny droplets of fat on structures called smooth endoplasmic reticula. The droplets combine with each other and other molecules and are then expelled and stored in spaces between cells. Mammary glands eventually secrete the milk through the breasts, udders, or, in the rare case of the platypus,  through ducts in the abdomen. Although this process is typically reserved for females, in some species, like dayak fruit bats, goats, and even cats, males can also lactate. Milk drinkers worldwide consume dairy from buffalo, goats, sheeps, camels, yaks, horses, and cows. Almost all of these species are ruminants, a type of mammal with four-chambered stomachs that yield large quantities of milk. Of these, cows were the most  easily domesticated and produce a milk that is both easily separated into cream and liquid and has a similar fat content to human milk. In their natural environment, mammals secrete milk on call  for immediate consumption by their young. But with the demands of thirsty consumers, the dairy industry has enlisted methods to step up production, enhance shelf life, and provide a variety of milk products. In the dairy, centrifugation machines spin milk at high speeds, forcing less dense fats to separate from the liquid and float up. After being skimmed off, this fat, known as butterfat, can be used in dairy products like butter, cream, and cheese. Or it can be later added back to  the liquid in varying proportions to yield different fat content milks. Full fat milk, sometimes referred to as whole milk, has 3.25% butterfat added compared to 1-2% for low and reduced fat milk, and less than half a percent  for skim milk. To stop reseparation of the fat from the water, or creaming, the mixture undergoes the high-energy pressurized process of homogenization. Before milk hits the shelves, it's also typically heat treated to reduce its level of microbes, a government-sanctioned process that raw milk enthusiasts argue  may reduce milk's nutritional worth. Milk spoilage is started by microbes, which consume and break down the nutrients in milk. That process causes butterfat  to clump together, leading to a visually unpleasant product. And the byproducts of the microbes' consumption are compounds that taste  and smell nasty. But there's a bigger problem. Raw milk can carry microbes that are the sources of deadly diseases, so in order to kill as many of those microbes as possible, and keep milk fresh longer, we use a technique called pasteurization. One version of this process involves exposing milk to about 30 seconds of high heat. Another version, called ultra-high temperature processing, or ultra pasteurization, blasts the milk with considerably higher  temperatures over just a few seconds. UHT milk boasts a much longer shelf life, up to twelve months unrefrigerated, compared to pasteurized milk's two weeks in the fridge. That's because the higher temperatures of UHT processing inactivate far more microbes. Yet the higher processing temperatures may adversely affect the nutritional and sensory properties of the milk. Ultimately, that choice lies in the consumer's taste and need for convenience. Fortunately, there are many  choices available in an industry that produces in excess of 840 million tons of products each year. "
529,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,xptpXSTtgSY,"Onboard the spacecraft,  the astronauts preset the timer, enclose themselves in capsules, and fall into a deep hibernation that’ll carry them several  hundred years into the future. This is a familiar scene  in many sci-fi films, but could humans ever actually hibernate in real life? Researchers interested in this question turn to the animal kingdom, where hibernation is commonplace, occurring in over 200 species  that we know of. Take the Arctic ground squirrel. Native to the North American tundra  and northern Russia, this animal burrows beneath the permafrost and slips into a state  of suspended animation, its body temperature plummeting  to a frigid -2.9 degrees Celsius. Others, like the female black bear,  can multitask, giving birth and lactating while they’re hibernating through the winter. The fat-tailed dwarf lemur prepares  for its long dormancy by gorging on food and storing the  majority of its fat reserves in its tail, doubling its body weight. After hibernation, it emerges looking as svelte as ever. So why do these animals  go to such extremes? Hibernation is a necessity, a survival tactic for making it through the harsh winter months when dwindling food and water reserves threaten survival. For many years, experts believed hibernation happened only in arctic and temperate environments. But more recently, they’ve discovered  animals hibernating even in arid deserts and tropical rainforests. As hibernation kicks in, animals’ heartbeats usually slow to about 1 to 3% of their original speed, like the dwarf lemur’s, which drops from its usual  roughly 180 beats per minute to just around four. Breathing also declines dramatically to just one breath every 10 to 21 minutes  in the lemur’s case. And black bears, like most hibernators, don’t urinate or defecate the entire hibernation season. Hibernating animals appear to stay alive by having just enough blood and oxygen moving around their bodies. And scans of hibernating animals reveal that their brain activity has just about flat-lined. But hibernation isn’t a long winter’s nap. As far as researchers know, in lemurs and ground squirrels anyway, the animals aren’t even sleeping for most of it. Hibernation is actually made up of regular bouts of reduced metabolic rate and body temperature known as torpor. Animals can be in torpor  for a few days to five weeks, after which they resume normal  metabolic rate and body temperature for about 24 hours, before going back into torpor again. The phenomenon is known  as an interbout arousal, and why it occurs is still a mystery. The behaviors inherent in hibernation, like going five weeks without sleep, or dropping to near-freezing body temperatures would be potentially fatal to non-hibernating species like us. To find out how hibernators are able to do this, researchers turned their attention to those animal’s genomes. So far, they’ve discovered that hibernation is controlled by genes that turn off and on in unique patterns throughout the year, fine-tuning the hibernator’s physiology and behavior. For example, ground squirrel, bear  and dwarf lemur studies have revealed that these animals are able to turn on the genes that control fat metabolism precisely when they need to use  their fat stores as fuel to survive  long periods of fasting. And the genes in question are present in all mammals, which means that researchers could study hibernating mammals to see how their unique control of physiology might help humans. Understanding how hibernators deal with reduced blood flow could lead to better treatments for protecting the brain during a stroke. Figuring out how these animals avoid muscle deterioration might improve the lives  of bedridden patients. And studying how hibernating animals  control their weight with ease could illuminate the relationship between metabolism and weight gain in humans. And yes, more research in this area might someday make human hibernation a real possibility. Imagine our surprise if the key to intergalactic travel turns out to be ground squirrels, black bears, and dwarf lemurs. "
530,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,xvjK-4NXRsM,"Each year in the United States, players of sports  and recreational activities receive between 2.5  and 4 million concussions. How dangerous are all those concussions? The answer is complicated, and lies in how the brain responds when something strikes it. The brain is made of soft fatty tissue, with a consistency something like jello. Inside its protective membranes and the skull's hard casing, this delicate organ  is usually well-shielded. But a sudden jolt can make the brain shift and bump against the skull's hard interior, and unlike jello, the brain's tissue isn't uniform. It's made of a vast network of 90 billion neurons, which relay signals through their long axons to communicate throughout the brain and control our bodies. This spindly structure makes  them very fragile so that when impacted, neurons will stretch and even tear. That not only disrupts their ability to communicate but as destroyed axons begin to degenerate, they also release toxins causing the death of other neurons, too. This combination of events causes a concussion. The damage can manifest in many different ways including blackout, headache, blurry vision, balance problems, altered mood and behavior, problems with memory, thinking, and sleeping, and the onset of anxiety and depression. Every brain is different, which explains why people's experiences of concussions vary so widely. Luckily, the majority of concussions fully heal and symptoms disappear within a matter of days or weeks. Lots of rest and a gradual return to activity allows the brain to heal itself. On the subject of rest, many people have heard that you're not supposed to sleep shortly after receiving a concussion because you might slip into a coma. That's a myth. So long as doctors aren't concerned there may also be a more severe brain injury, like a brain bleed, there's no documented problem with going to sleep after a concussion. Sometimes, victims of concussion can experience something called post-concussion syndrome, or PCS. People with PCS may experience constant headaches, learning difficulties, and behavioral symptoms that even affect their personal relationships for months or years after the injury. Trying to play through a concussion, even for only a few minutes, or returning to sports too soon after a concussion, makes it more likely to develop PCS. In some cases, a concussion can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms unfold slowly over time. That's often true of  subconcussive impacts which result from lower impact jolts to the head than those that cause concussions. This category of injury doesn't cause noticable symptoms right away, but can lead to severe degenerative brain diseases over time if it happens repeatedly. Take soccer players, who are known for repeatedly heading soccer balls. Using a technique called Diffusion Tensor Imaging, we're beginning to find out what effect that has on the brain. This method allows scientists to find large axon bundles and see how milder blows might alter them structurally. In 2013, researchers using  this technique discovered that athletes who had headed the ball most, about 1,800 times a year, had damaged the structural integrity of their axon bundles. The damage was similar to how a rope will fail when the individual fibers start to fray. Those players also performed worse on short-term memory tests, so even though no one suffered full-blown concussions, these subconcussive hits added up to measurable damage over time. In fact, researchers know that an overload of subconcussive hits is linked to a degenerative brain disease known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, or CTE. People with CTE suffer from changes in their mood and behavior that begin appearing in their 30s or 40s followed by problems with thinking and memory that can, in some cases, even result in dementia. The culprit is a protein called tau. Usually, tau proteins support tiny tubes inside our axons called microtubules. It's thought that repeated subconcussive hits damage the microtubules, causing the tau proteins to dislodge and clump together. The clumps disrupt transport and communication along the neuron and drive the breakdown of connections within the brain. Once the tau proteins  start clumping together, they cause more clumps to form and continue to spread  throughout the brain, even after head impacts have stopped. The data show that at least among football players, between 50 and 80% of concussions go unreported and untreated. Sometimes that's because it's hard to tell a concussion has occurred  in the first place. But it's also often due to pressure or a desire to keep going despite the fact that something's wrong. This doesn't just undermine recovery. It's also dangerous. Our brains aren't invincible. They still need us to shield them from harm and help them undo damage once it's been done. "
531,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,y6u1GPpJuR4,"When desert locusts are well fed, they're solitary creatures. But when food becomes scarce, hungry, desperate locusts crowd onto small patches of land where they can still find  something to eat. Contact between different locusts' hind legs set off a slew of reactions that change their appearance and behavior. Now, instead of shunning their peers, they seek each other out. The locusts eventually start marching and then fly away in large numbers seeking a better habitat. These gigantic swarms can host millions of insects and travel thousands of miles, devastating vegetation and crops. They stay close to each other, but not too close, or they might get eaten by their hungry neighbors. When many individual organisms, like locusts, bacteria, anchovies, or bats, come together and move  as one coordinated entity, that's a swarm. From a handful of birds  to billions of insects, swarms can be almost any size. But what they have in common is that there's no leader. Members of the swarm interact only with their nearest neighbors or through indirect cues. Each individual follows simple rules: Travel in the same direction as those around you, stay close, and avoid collisions. There are many benefits to traveling in a group like this. Small prey may fool predators by assembling into a swarm that looks like a much bigger organism. And congregating in a large group reduces the chance that any single  individual will be captured. Moving in the same direction as your neighbors saves energy by sharing the effort of fighting wind or water resistance. It may even be easier to find a mate in a swarm. Swarming can also allow groups of animals to accomplish tasks they couldn't do individually. When hundreds or millions or organisms follow the same simple rules, sophisticated behavior called swarm intelligence may arise. A single ant can't do much on its own, but an ant colony  can solve complex problems, like building a nest and finding the shortest path to a food source. But sometimes, things can go wrong. In a crowd, diseases spread more easily, and some swarming organisms may start eating each other if food is scarce. Even some of the benefits of swarms, like more efficient navigation, can have catastrophic consequences. Army ants are one example. They lay down chemicals called pheromones which signal their neighbors to follow the trail. This is good if the head of the group is marching towards a food source. But occasionally the ants in the front can veer off course. The whole swarm can get caught in a loop following the pheromone trail until they die of exhaustion. Humans are notoriously individualistic, though social, animals. But is there anything we can learn from collective swarm-based organization? When it comes to technology, the answer is definitely yes. Bats can teach drones how to navigate confined spaces without colliding, fish can help design software for safer driving, and insects are inspiring robot teams that can assist search and rescue missions. For swarms of humans, it's perhaps more complicated and depends on the motives and leadership. Swarm behavior in human populations can sometimes manifest as a destructive mob. But collective action can also produce a crowd-sourced scientific breakthrough an artistic expression, or a peaceful global revolution. "

533,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,yGfTDcHJHSI,"We live in a vast universe,  on a small wet planet, where billions of years ago single-celled life forms evolved from the same elements as all non-living material  around them, proliferating and radiating into an incredible ray of complex life forms. All of this— living and inanimate, microscopic and cosmic— is governed by mathematical laws with apparently arbitrary constants. And this opens up a question: If the universe is completely governed  by these laws, couldn’t a powerful enough computer  simulate it exactly? Could our reality actually be an  incredibly detailed simulation set in place by a much more  advanced civilization? This idea may sound like science fiction, but it has been the subject of serious inquiry. Philosopher Nick Bostrom advanced  a compelling argument that we’re likely living in a simulation, and some scientists also think it’s a possibility. These scientists have started thinking about experimental tests to find out whether our  universe is a simulation. They are hypothesizing about what the  constraints of the simulation might be, and how those constraints could lead  to detectable signs in the world. So where might we look for those glitches? One idea is that as a simulation runs, it might accumulate errors over time. To correct for these errors the simulators could adjust the constants in the laws of nature. These shifts could be tiny— for instance, certain constants we’ve measured  with accuracies of parts per million have stayed steady for decades, so any drift would have to be on an even smaller scale. But as we gain more precision in our measurements of these constants, we might detect slight changes over time. Another possible place to look comes from the concept that finite computing power, no matter how huge, can’t simulate infinities. If space and time are continuous, then even a tiny piece of the universe  has infinite points and becomes impossible to simulate  with finite computing power. So a simulation would have to represent  space and time in very small pieces. These would be almost  incomprehensibly tiny. But we might be able to search for them by using certain subatomic particles as probes. The basic principle is this:  the smaller something is, the more sensitive it will  be to disruption— think of hitting a pothole on a skateboard versus in a truck. Any unit in space-time would be so small that most things would travel through it  without disruption— not just objects large enough to be  visible to the naked eye, but also molecules, atoms,  and even electrons and most of the other subatomic particles we’ve discovered. If we do discover a tiny unit in  space-time or a shifting constant in a natural law, would that prove the universe is a simulation? No— it would only be the  first of many steps. There could be other explanations  for each of those findings. And a lot more evidence would be needed  to establish the simulation hypothesis as a working theory of nature. However many tests we design, we’re limited by some assumptions  they all share. Our current understanding of the natural  world on the quantum level breaks down at what’s known  as the planck scale. If the unit of space-time is on this scale, we wouldn’t be able to look for it with our current scientific understanding. There’s still a wide range of things that are smaller than what’s  currently observable but larger than the planck scale to investigate. Similarly, shifts in the constants of natural laws could occur so slowly that they would only be observable over the lifetime of the universe. So they could exist even if we don’t detect them over centuries or millennia  of measurements. We're also biased towards thinking that  our universe’s simulator, if it exists, makes calculations the same way we do, with similar computational limitations. Really, we have no way of knowing what an alien civilization’s constraints and methods would be— but we have to start somewhere. It may never be possible to prove  conclusively that the universe either is, or isn’t, a simulation, but we’ll always be pushing science and technology forward in pursuit of the question: what is the nature of reality?

534,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,yc2-363MIQs,"It can strike without warning, at any moment. You may be walking across a soft carpet and reaching for the door knob when suddenly...zap! To understand static electricity, we first need to know a bit about the nature of matter. All matter is made up of atoms that consist of three types of smaller particles: negatively charged electrons, positively charged protons, and neutral neutrons. Normally, the electrons and protons in an atom balance out, which is why most matter you come across is electrically neutral. But electrons are tiny  and almost insignificant in mass, and rubbing or friction can give loosely bound electrons enough energy to leave their atoms and attach to others, migrating between different surfaces. When this happens, the first object is left  with more protons than electrons and becomes positively charged, while the one with more electrons accumulates a negative charge. This situation is called a charge imbalance, or net charge separation. But nature tends towards balance, so when one of these newly charged bodies comes into contact with another material, the mobile electrons will take the first chance they get to go where they're most needed, either jumping off the negatively charged object, or jumping onto the positively charged one in an attempt to restore the neutral charge equilibrium. And this quick movement of electrons, called static discharge, is what we recognize as that sudden spark. This process doesn't happen  with just any objects. Otherwise you'd be getting zapped all the time. Conductors like metals and salt water tend to have loosely bound outer electrons, which can easily flow between molecules. On the other hand, insulators  like plastics, rubber and glass have tightly bound electrons that won't readily jump to other atoms. Static build-up is most likely to occur when one of the materials involved is an insulator. When you walk across a rug, electrons from your body will rub off onto it, while the rug's insulating wool will resist losing its own electrons. Although your body and the rug together are still electrically neutral, there is now a charge polarization between the two. And when you reach to touch the door knob, zap! The metal door knob's loosely  bound electrons hop to your hand to replace the electrons  your body has lost. When it happens in your bedroom, it's a minor nuisance. But in the great outdoors, static electricity can be a terrifying, destructive force of nature. In certain conditions, charge separation will occur in clouds. We don't know exactly how this happens. It may have to do with the circulation of water droplets and ice particles within them. Regardless, the charge imbalance is neutralized by being released towards another body, such as a building, the Earth, or another cloud in a giant spark that we know as lightning. And just as your fingers can be zapped over and over in the same spot, you better believe that lightning can strike the same place more than once. "
535,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,ypF037wlYZg,"Almost 2000 years ago, the Roman philosopher Seneca peered at his book through a glass of water. Suddenly, the text below was transformed. The words magically became clear. But it wasn't until a millennium later that that same principle would be used to create  the earliest glasses. Today, glasses can help millions of people with poor vision due to uncorrected refractive errors. The key to understanding what that means lies with the term refraction, the ability of a transparent medium, like glass, water, or the eye to change the direction of light passing through it. The eye has two main refractive surfaces: the cornea and the lens. Ideally, these surfaces work together to refract light in a way that accurately focuses light onto the retina, the layer of light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye that works with the brain to give rise to vision. But many people develop refractive errors, either during childhood as their eyes are growing, or in later life as their eyes age. Imperfections in the cornea and lens cause refracted light to be focused in front of or behind the retina, making images appear blurry. People with refractive errors can still see color, movement, and light, but the details of what they're looking at are out of focus. People experience refractive  errors in different ways, owing to differences in their eyes. In some, light refracts too much, and in others, too little. Eyes with a focal point in front of the retina are called myopic, or short-sighted. They can see close objects clearly, but those far away are out of focus. But when the focus point  is behind the retina, people are hyperopic, or long-sighted. For them, objects close up are unfocused, but distant objects are crystal clear. Finally, some people have a cornea with a non-spherical shape that causes astigmatism, a form of out-of-focus vision that makes all objects seem blurred, whether close or far. As we age, our eyes face new challenges. When we're young, the lens of the eye is flexible and can change shape to bring images into focus, something called accommodation. This keeps objects in focus when we shift our gaze from far to near. But as we get older, the lens becomes less flexible, and can't change shape when we want to look at near objects. This is called presbyopia, and it affects adults starting around the age of 40 years. Myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, and presbyopia. Each of these is a refractive error. Nowadays we can fix them all with glasses or contact lenses, which work by refocusing light so it strikes the retina precisely. It's even possible to correct vision with surgery using lasers that change the shape of the cornea and alter its refractive properties. But glasses remain the most popular. By using carefully crafted lenses to steer light to exactly the right spot on the retina, a person's clear vision can be restored. We've come a long way  since Seneca's discovery and the crude glasses of yesteryear. In 1727, a British optician named Edward Scarlett developed the modern style of glasses which are kept in place with arms which hook over each ear. Today's glasses take their inspiration from that design, but they're also much more precise and personal. Each pair is tailored for an individual to bring out their unique powers of sight. So if you're one of the 500 million people with a problem with close or far vision, or both, there's a pair of glasses out there waiting to reveal a whole new world that's hiding in plain view. "
536,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,z-IR48Mb3W0,"Depression is the leading cause of disability in the world. In the United States, close to 10% of adults  struggle with depression. But because it's a mental illness, it can be a lot harder to understand than, say, high cholesterol. One major source of confusion is the difference between having depression and just feeling depressed. Almost everyone feels down from time to time. Getting a bad grade, losing a job, having an argument, even a rainy day can bring on feelings of sadness. Sometimes there's no trigger at all. It just pops up out of the blue. Then circumstances change, and those sad feelings disappear. Clinical depression is different. It's a medical disorder, and it won't go away just because you want it to. It lingers for at least  two consecutive weeks, and significantly interferes  with one's ability to work, play, or love. Depression can have a lot of different symptoms: a low mood, loss of interest in things you'd normally enjoy, changes in appetite, feeling worthless or excessively guilty, sleeping either too much or too little, poor concentration, restlessness or slowness, loss of energy, or recurrent thoughts of suicide. If you have at least five of those symptoms, according to psychiatric guidelines, you qualify for a diagnosis of depression. And it's not just behavioral symptoms. Depression has physical manifestations inside the brain. First of all, there are changes that could be seen with the naked eye and X-ray vision. These include smaller frontal lobes and hippocampal volumes. On a more microscale, depression is associated with a few things: the abnormal transmission or depletion of certain neurotransmitters, especially serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, blunted circadian rhythms, or specific changes in the REM and slow-wave parts of your sleep cycle, and hormone abnormalities, such as high cortisol and deregulation of thyroid hormones. But neuroscientists still don't have a complete picture of what causes depression. It seems to have to do with a complex interaction between genes and environment, but we don't have a diagnostic tool that can accurately predict where or when it will show up. And because depression symptoms are intangible, it's hard to know who might look fine but is actually struggling. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, it takes the average person suffering with a mental illness over ten years to ask for help. But there are very effective treatments. Medications and therapy complement each other to boost brain chemicals. In extreme cases, electroconvulsive therapy, which is like a controlled seizure in the patient's brain, is also very helpful. Other promising treatments, like transcranial magnetic stimulation, are being investigated, too. So, if you know someone  struggling with depression, encourage them, gently, to seek out some of these options. You might even offer to help with specific tasks, like looking up therapists in the area, or making a list of questions to ask a doctor. To someone with depression, these first steps can seem insurmountable. If they feel guilty or ashamed, point out that depression  is a medical condition, just like asthma or diabetes. It's not a weakness  or a personality trait, and they shouldn't expect themselves to just get over it anymore than they could will themselves to get over a broken arm. If you haven't experienced  depression yourself, avoid comparing it to times you've felt down. Comparing what they're experiencing to normal, temporary feelings of sadness can make them feel guilty for struggling. Even just talking about depression openly can help. For example, research shows that asking someone about suicidal thoughts actually reduces their suicide risk. Open conversations about mental illness help erode stigma and make it easier for people to ask for help. And the more patients seek treatment, the more scientists will learn about depression, and the better the treatments will get. "
537,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,z0M7_HPSi14,"In 1800, the explorer  Alexander von Humboldt witnessed a swarm of electric eels leap out of the water to defend themselves against oncoming horses. Most people thought the story so unusual that Humboldt made it up. But fish using electricity is more common than you might think; and yes, electric eels are a type of fish. Underwater, where light is scarce, electrical signals offer ways to communicate, navigate, and find—plus, in rare cases, stun—prey. Nearly 350 species of fish have specialized anatomical structures that generate and detect electrical signals. These fish are divided into two groups, depending on how much  electricity they produce. Scientists call the first group the weakly electric fish. Structures near their tails  called electric organs produce up to a volt of electricity, about two-thirds as much as a AA battery. How does this work? The fish's brain sends a signal through its nervous system to the electric organ, which is filled with stacks of hundreds or thousands of disc-shaped cells called electrocytes. Normally, electrocytes pump out sodium and potassium ions to maintain a positive charge outside and negative charge inside. But when the nerve signal arrives at the electrocyte, it prompts the ion gates to open. Positively charged ions flow back in. Now, one face of the electrocyte is negatively charged outside and positively charged inside. But the far side has the opposite charge pattern. These alternating charges  can drive a current, turning the electrocyte  into a biological battery. The key to these fish's powers  is that nerve signals are coordinated to arrive at each cell  at exactly the same time. That makes the stacks of electrocytes act like thousands of batteries in series. The tiny charges from each one add up to an electrical field that can travel several meters. Cells called electroreceptors buried in the skin allow the fish to constantly sense this field and the changes to it caused by the surroundings or other fish. The Peter’s elephantnose fish,  for example, has an elongated chin called a schnauzenorgan that's riddled in electroreceptors. That allows it to intercept signals from other fish, judge distances, detect the shape and size of nearby objects, and even determine whether a buried insect is dead or alive. But the elephantnose and other weakly electric fish don't produce enough electricity to attack their prey. That ability belongs to the strongly electric fish, of which there are only  a handful of species. The most powerful strongly electric fish is the electric knife fish, more commonly known as the electric eel. Three electric organs span almost its entire two-meter body. Like the weakly electric fish, the electric eel uses its signals to navigate and communicate, but it reserves its strongest  electric discharges for hunting using a two-phased attack that susses out and then incapacitates its prey. First, it emits two  or three strong pulses, as much as 600 volts. These stimulate the prey's muscles, sending it into spasms and generating waves that reveal its hiding place. Then, a volley of fast,  high-voltage discharges causes even more intense  muscle contractions. The electric eel can also curl up so that the electric fields generated at each end of the electric organ overlap. The electrical storm eventually exhausts and immobilizes the prey, and the electric eel can swallow its meal alive. The other two strongly electric fish are the electric catfish, which can unleash 350 volts with an electric organ that occupies most of its torso, and the electric ray, with kidney-shaped electric organs on either side of its head that produce as much as 220 volts. There is one mystery in the world of electric fish: why don't they electrocute themselves? It may be that the size of strongly electric fish allows them to withstand their own shocks, or that the current passes out  of their bodies too quickly. Some scientists think that special  proteins may shield the electric organs, but the truth is, this is one mystery  science still hasn't illuminated. "

No no wait there There's something buildings an urban area this must be it they opened their bomb Bay doors and their bombs drop But it wasn't the fuel reserves at Rochester and thames haven [that] bomber crew was flying over those bombs fell on London they had bombed the biggest Civilian Centre in the uk there was outrage Winston Churchill assuming it was a deliberate attack ordered a retaliatory strike on Berlin these raf bombers were supposed to Target Commercial and industrial targets, but they too missed their targets at the cost of German civilian lives and like that the gloves were off Hitler who had previously ordered the luftwaffe not to intentionally target Civilians now Rescinded that command and on september 7th one of the largest coordinated bombing raids with nearly a thousand bombers spread out over 32 kilometres commenced their target London the heart of the British Empire The idea was that if they could break the people of London maybe they could break the empire itself? the Battle of Britain raged for months German losses were mounting But the raf was also on the ropes the hope of the german side was that this would be the knockout blow That without enough [airpower] to defend their major cities the average citizen would lose faith in the government's ability to protect them and break under the constant threat The truth though was that if the luftwaffe ever had a real chance of winning the battle of britain it was right there on the week of the [7th] by not attacking the Populace the Raf was exhausted and worn down to the point where another week of concerted attack might might have broken them But instead this massive diversion of [resources] to attack targets that didn't really reduce the raf capacity to fight gave them Just the space they needed to come [back] and then smash the raids on London on September 15th Germany made one last push to break London and instead was herself broken in the massive Air battle that ensued with nearly Thousand planes in the Air over London the Germans were repelled and reeling from recent defeats canceled their planned invasion of Britain They came up with a new plan one which doubled down [on] the strategy of breaking the civilian Populace They would abandon the struggle for control of the air and focus on a campaign of terror that every night when British air defenses were far less effective sent waves of German bombers to deliver a payload of destruction to the Streets of London but in the end this massive diversion of resources Took more away from the Nazi war effort than it ever did from the allies which historically is actually almost always what happens with [air-based] Campaigns since the Dawn of aviation it's been the dream of military strategists to win wars without ever putting troops on the [ground] but short of the use of Nuclear arms it's practically never worked Whether it be the early attempts with zeppelin's and world war one the axis blitz or the allied bombings of places like Dresden during world? war two the [napalm] campaigns of Vietnam or the modern conflict in the middle East and the Blitz makes this fact clear as The Germans pursued this strategy further and further it became increasingly evident that the cost and men and Materiel to the German forces exceeded the actual economic damage they were inflicting even when their goal was primarily to just grind the British economy to a halt as Soon as the goal shifted Toward breaking the will of the populace the effect on wartime production became marginal at best month after month British War production Rose and enlistment never slackened and although nothing is as simple or as clear-cut as myth making tends to make it this also brought together the British people as German bombs fell on London and Casualties mounted those with parents siblings and friends whose lives were cut short by the attacks didn't lose the will to fight Quite the opposite they instead became determined to never surrender They threw themselves into the defense of britain with a resolve that only comes from the deepest loss and were prepared to make sacrifices That an unscarred population might never accept you see that's the thing about Strategic bombing even when the objective is [to] strike industry or leadership targets each civilian casualty each incident of collateral damage Rather than breaking the enemy just creates new groups who will forever oppose surrender and the blitz also created a sense of national unity through shared Struggle Everybody who lived through the blitz rich and poor shared a commonality that crossed many previous divides and whether it was spending nights? Huddled together in a shelter manning a civil defense gun or working together on a volunteer fire crew the blitz literally brought people together [it] made them understand each other and rely on each other as they'd never done before and again although nothing's ever as rosy as we remember in the end the blitz did more to unify britain than to divide it and I think that concludes this look back at world war two for now anyway.

Music ""Arrangement - Actraiser [Birth of the people]"" 1878: The Congress of Berlin. A graying man with a proud, walrus mustache, stands, and says, ""Europe today is a powder keg, and the leaders are like men smoking in an arsenal. A single spark will set off an explosion that will consume us all. I cannot tell you when that explosion will occur, but I can tell you where: some damned foolish thing in the Balkans will set it off."" 1897: A prince, in the middle of his life, goes to visit the man, the old man now. It is the last time the two will meet, for the younger, Wilhelm II, dismissed this old man years before. But as their visit concludes,the old man issues a warning. He says, ""Your majesty, so long as you have this present officer corps, you can do as you please. But when this is no longer the case, it will be VERY different for you."" Then he says, ""The crash will come 20 years after my departure if things go on like this."" The old man will die in July of 1898. In November, 1918, that prince, Wilhelm II, will abdicate the throne, having lost the backing of his army in the disaster that was the First World War. Bismarck's prediction was off by only 4 months. Such was the mind that would use Europe for a chessboard, and redraw the map forever. But this was something that few could see in his youth. Otto's time in Grade School was middling, and we know little of his early teenage years. But at 17, when he enters college, we begin to get a picture of the man. 6 feet of dashing, with a tousled mane of copper blond hair, often seen walking, not with a walking stick, but with a twisted staff of iron. He cut a dashing figure. Classes...weren't really for him. He stopped going almost immediately, preferring Byron and Walter Scott as tutors to any other. He was quick to words, and equally quick to a challenge. He got himself into more than one duel per month while he was at his first university, engaging in 26 contests of honor and being wounded only once. To his dying day, he would insist that he was only wounded because his opponent's rapier broke. He consumed monumental amounts of alcohol, discovered a profound (if not so profound) love of the fairer sex, and managed to rack up a small mountain of debts. Most intriguing of all, though, he got himself cast as a character named ""Otto Von Rebenmark"" when his roommate wrote a novel about their wild college life. (By the way, this man, who was quite aptly named Motley, would soon become a historian of some note, and one of the diplomats who kept Europe from siding with the Confederacy in the American Civil War.) Anyway, That wild college life of theirs eventually caught up to Otto, and he moved to Berlin both to attend law school, and to dodge the consequences of his roguish ways. Still rooming with Motley, he never once went to class while in law school. But when graduation time drew near, he hired what is politely known as a ""crammer"" at the last minute, and managed to pass the exam to become a practitioner of law. And all the while, he read voraciously. Not only romantic poets, but also history, economics, and philosophy, (Although, not the heady abstractions of Hegel or Kant that were the rage at the time). By the time he left law school, he felt ready for a career in the diplomatic service. Unfortunately, the foreign minister did not hold a high opinion of the diplomatic abilities of Prussian nobility, and preferred to hire from without. So, rather than being assigned some glorious foreign posting, Bismarck was soon sent to Aachen, a territory taken from the French in the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815). And he was given the job of figuring out how to better integrate it into Prussia. This task never really captured his interest. It was the English he was far more interested in. For Aachen had become a popular spa and vacation spot for the English gentry, and, more notably, their daughters. Unfortunately, he was soon canned after he overstayed a river trip with one of these daughters, by 3 months. It took some significant family influence to get this self-designated ""leave"" quietly swept under the rug. And Otto was soon involuntary volunteered for the army. But before even his year of mandatory service was done, his mother took ill and died. This tragedy finally made his path clear. His father had never been good at managing anything, and his mother had run their more unruly estates. With her passing, Otto would take over this duty. A gentleman farmer's life for him. He was completely unprepared for this task, but he did still have his secret weapon. The one expedient that had carried him through every challenge dealt him: cramming. So as his military service wrapped up, he devoured books on agricultural science, estate management, and economics. He even managed to get himself into a soil chemistry course at a nearby agricultural institute. Armed with this knowledge, he set to his task with vigor. And so, even as the agricultural markets of northern Europe collapsed around him, his estate grew in value. And his diligence was matched only by his eccentricity. He became known for unpredictable behavior, like marking his entrance into a neighbor's house by firing a pistol into their ceiling, or releasing foxes into people's drawing rooms. He earned the nickname ""The Wildman Bismarck"" from the locals, and, as always, from the local ladies as well. But this ""Wildman"" treated his laborers well, (much better than their ceilings and drawing rooms, anyway) and he further devoted himself to his studies, diving deep into history, poetry, English politics, and even philosophy. (Though he did still have a preference for Spinoza over the German philosophers that were informing many of his more liberal colleagues' thoughts at the time.) All of this, (and perhaps age) began to refine him, to smooth out his roughest edges. And though country life weighed heavy on him, in many ways,  he was well suited for it. It looked as though the life of a country squire was to be his calling. Over time, he settled in, he made friends, he even married a woman who seemed wholly unsuited to him. A quiet, devout woman with no interest in politics or  English poetry. But, she made him quite happy. In fact, he adopted her religion, Pietism (a Lutheran reform movement) to marry her, and such is the strange character of Bismarck that he did so earnestly. (Or, at least he adopted the parts of her faith which he earnestly found compelling.) But her father doubted that Otto was sincere in his conversion (this was, the ""Wildman"" Bismarck, after all). But Bismarck had a plan. Bismarck ALWAYS has a plan. He wrote his beloved's father a letter, detailing his path to finding faith. And when the man still hesitated, Bismarck, being Bismarck, seized the moment, tore all the way across Pomerania in the middle of winter, and showed up at the man's estate to convince him in person. When Bismarck returned from this excursion, he found on his desk a letter. It was an invitation, to take charge of running the dikes on the Elbe (River). It may not seem like much, but it was an official position. His time in the doghouse with the government might be over. So he attacked the work. Then, in 1847, something monumental happened. The King of Prussia called a parliament. For the first time, Prussians would get together, debate, and vote on things. But Otto's wedding date was near. And besides, he HATED Berlin, and he was a staunch conservative, believing in the power of the monarchy, at a time when liberalism and democracy were in vogue. Even the idea of a parliament grated against his royalist leanings. For though this was a summoned, rather than an elected parliament, it was almost certainly going to be used to push for a  proper elected parliament. One which, by its very nature, must take its power from the royal government. So he was reluctant to go. Even if he were to be summoned, he might not. But then, fate turned. He received another letter. An acquaintance, whose good graces he wanted to stay in, had suddenly fallen ill, and now requested that Otto take up his post as representative of the Prussian-Saxon nobility. This request made no sense, as technically, Otto was not part of the Prussian-Saxon nobility. His estates were all either in Altmark or Pomerania. But never mind that. He couldn't turn down such an important request. So, he made his way to the United Diet, where a push for a true parliament was already in session. Pro-democratic speeches were given. One man got up and declared that the Prussian people had only thrown back Napoleon because they were promised a constitution. This was too much. Bismarck stood, and responded that the Prussian people had thrown back Napoleon for PRUSSIA. Did the man REALLY think that Prussians wouldn't have stood up against an invader, without being promised a piece of paper?! The hall erupted in boos. People shouted and stamped, the place was chaos. But Bismarck, being Bismarck, just picked up a newspaper, and began to leisurely read through it until they were quite done. And then, he finished his speech. And in that moment, Bismarck, the country squire, became Bismarck, the statesman. Music ( Art of the Possible) "
540,Education,27,UCsooa4yRKGN_zEE8iknghZA | TED-Ed,znSeL66e8qE,"Concrete is the most widely used construction material in the world. It can be found in swathes of city pavements, bridges that span vast rivers, and the tallest skyscrapers on earth. But this sturdy substance does have a weakness: it’s prone to catastrophic cracking that costs tens of billions of dollars to repair each year. But what if we could avoid that problem, by creating concrete that heals itself? This idea isn’t as far-fetched as it may seem. It boils down to an understanding of how concrete forms, and how to exploit that process to our benefit. Concrete is a combination of coarse stone and sand particles, called aggregates, that mix with cement, a powdered blend of clay and limestone. When water gets added to this mix, the cement forms a paste and coats the aggregates, quickly hardening through a chemical reaction called hydration. Eventually, the resulting material grows strong enough to prop up buildings that climb hundreds of meters into the sky. While people have been using a variety of recipes to produce cement for over 4,000 years, concrete itself has a surprisingly short lifespan. After 20 to 30 years, natural processes like concrete shrinkage, excessive freezing and thawing, and heavy loads can trigger cracking. And it’s not just big breaks that count: tiny cracks can be just as dangerous. Concrete is often used as a secondary support around steel reinforcements. In this concrete, even small cracks can channel water, oxygen, and carbon dioxide that corrode the steel and lead to disastrous collapse. On structures like bridges and highways that are constantly in use, detecting these problems before they lead to catastrophe becomes a huge and costly challenge. But not doing so would also endanger thousands of lives. Fortunately, we’re already experimenting with ways this material could start fixing itself. And some of these solutions are inspired by concrete’s natural self-healing mechanism. When water enters these tiny cracks, it hydrates the concrete’s calcium oxide. The resulting calcium hydroxide reacts with carbon dioxide in the air, starting a process called autogenous healing, where microscopic calcium carbonate crystals form and gradually fill the gap. Unfortunately, these crystals can only do so much, healing cracks that are less than 0.3mm wide. Material scientists have figured out how to heal cracks up to twice that size by adding hidden glue into the concrete mix. If we put adhesive-filled fibers and tubes into the mixture, they’ll snap open when a crack forms, releasing their sticky contents and sealing the gap. But adhesive chemicals often behave very differently from concrete, and over time, these adhesives can lead to even worse cracks. So perhaps the best way to heal large cracks is to give concrete the tools to help itself. Scientists have discovered that some bacteria and fungi can produce minerals, including the calcium carbonate found in autogenous healing. Experimental blends of concrete include these bacterial or fungal spores alongside nutrients in their concrete mix, where they could lie dormant for hundreds of years. When cracks finally appear and water trickles into the concrete, the spores germinate, grow, and consume the nutrient soup that surrounds them, modifying their local environment to create the perfect conditions for calcium carbonate to grow. These crystals gradually fill the gaps, and after roughly three weeks, the hard-working microbes can completely repair cracks up to almost 1mm wide. When the cracks seal, the bacteria or fungi will make spores and go dormant once more— ready to start a new cycle of self-healing when cracks form again. Although this technique has been studied extensively, we still have a ways to go before incorporating it in the global production of concrete. But, these spores have huge potential to make concrete more resilient and long-lasting— which could drastically reduce the financial and environmental cost of concrete production. Eventually, these microorganisms may force us to reconsider the way we think about our cities, bringing our inanimate concrete jungles to life. "
541,Science & Technology,28,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,beUhzQAkanM,"And those bright green specks inside their bodies are showing us what they’re eating. It’s not food. Those are tiny pieces of... We hear a lot about pollution from single use plastic items, like plastic straws and shopping bags that are clogging marine habitats. Although these large pieces of plastic contribute the most to the overall mass of plastic polluting oceans, they count for a small share of the total number of plastic particles. That’s because most of the plastic pieces in the oceans don’t look like this. They’re tiny particles that look like this, and where they’re coming from might surprise you. “Modern fibers, alone or in blends with natural fibers, brought new innovations in cool, crisp comfortable clothes.” Back in the 1940s, fabrics like nylon, acrylic and rayon -- all made from plastic -- became really popular. These synthetic clothes were cheap to produce, comfortable to wear, and as more people have bought clothes for athletics and leisure, companies have been making more clothes out of plastic. By 2010, over half of all the fabric in our clothing was made from synthetic fibers. In the meantime, marine scientists noticed that habitats were being polluted with tiny pieces of plastic called “microplastics”. These are objects are smaller than 5 millimeters, and can be anything from tiny shards broken off larger items to microbeads developed for use in cosmetic products. Microplastics are found in marine habitats everywhere on Earth. Concentrations of microplastics have been found on coastal beaches in South Africa, The Great Lakes of North America, rivers in Britain, and at the bottom of an oceanic trench near Russia. Turns out, a large share of those microplastics are microfibers: tiny strands of plastic, and they’re coming from our laundry. Looking at this fleece jacket up close, you can see that its fuzzy material is actually a fabric made from tiny strands of plastic woven together. When we wash a synthetic piece of clothing, like this fleece, the fabric is pulled loose and tiny microfibers fall out. Scientists actually tested three types of synthetic clothing to see which types shed the most using a washing machine fitted with a special filter. They determined that acrylic shed the most microfibers. Over 700,000 on the first wash alone. And even though fiber loss goes down after the first wash, the sheer number of people doing laundry adds up, making microfibers a huge contributor to the nearly five trillion pieces of microplastics that are floating around the world’s oceans. In most dryers there’s a mesh screen to catch lint, but washing machines typically don't have a filter. So everything that falls off our clothes is flushed down the drain. From there, microfibers might move through a sewage treatment plant, but the filters are often too large to stop them from passing through and flowing to a discharge point at a nearby marine habitat. Once they reach the ocean, microfibers are consumed by plankton and other filter feeders that eat debris falling to the seafloor. And then the plastic starts making its way up the food chain, passed on by predators feeding on  organisms that have ingested microfibers. Eventually, it reaches us. Plastic enters human bodies when we eat seafood containing microfibers. Like these, which scientists found in a piece of fish they bought at a seafood market. So, what can be done? Switching to other materials isn’t feasible because synthetic clothes -- they’re cheap. A lot cheaper than making apparel with other fabrics. But what you can do is add a filter to your washing machine that would catch microfibers falling off when you do your laundry. Problem is, those are pretty expensive, So another solution is using filter bags that trap microfibers before they fall off into the wash when you do your laundry. But the most effective change of all would just be buying fewer synthetic clothes, or at least, washing them less often. And what less often means... that's up to you.

542,Science & Technology,28,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,d95dOH-7GHM,"Some moments feel so important, we believe there is a perfect recording of them etched in our minds. ARMSTRONG: “That’s one small step for man…” REAGAN: “Tear down this wall” NEWSCASTER: “Diana Princess of Wales, is dead.” For many, 9/11 was one of those moments. ""I was getting ready to go to class to class and I put on the TV"" ""And the newscaster stopped and said this just in"" ""Two planes hit the twin towers"" ""Every single channel had a building that was on fire"" ""This businessman was covered in dust"" ""Then I saw the big hole in the side of the building"" ""Yeah it was sort of surreal"" ""very confusing and disorienting"" ""I felt a sense of dread"" "" I remember my mom was working in the city, And I remember smoke billowing out over the water of the long island sound … behind the building where I went to elementary school. "" I was just talking with my parents about it one day and my mom goes no you know in 2001 I was working in Connecticut. And there were other problems with Melanie’s memory of that day. Her classroom windows didn’t look out over the water The World Trade Center was over 40 miles away and the smoke was drifting in the opposite direction How could I possibly have seen the smoke billowing from over the water … Like how would I see that. Your memories for 9/11 are probably not as accurate as you think. We know about 50 percent of the details of that memory change in a year even though most people are convinced they're 100 percent right. They might correctly remember the gist of the day, but not details like who they were with, what they were doing when they heard, and what exactly they saw. Even our most significant memories - the ones that form the foundation of our life story - aren’t perfect recordings - they can shift and warp over time. It feels like the whole purpose of memory should be to preserve the past. So why are memories so unreliable? How exactly does remembering work? Wait a second now, I do remember. You're.... uhhh. Memory, that everybody has, is a goldmine of unexplored and untapped potential. Our memory just mediates our interractions with the world. Memory is one of our most fundamental activities, that it is only when it fails us that we think about it at all. Yanjaa Wintersoul is a grandmaster of memory All right here we go. 5 years ago, she discovered the world of memory competitions when I first started it was mostly like a bunch of white guys from Europe and very like sad looking competition rooms. They memorize decks of cards in seconds, thousands of digits in an hour. It looks like we're all taking a very speedy SATs. I have three world records: one for images, one for names of faces, and one for words. And she's demonstrated her skills on TV shows around the world Steve Harvey: Ok, Page 38. Yanjaa: It starts mid-sentence ... ""information effectively by using humor."" We gave her ten minutes to memorize these 500 numbers ... and... 539-166-974-579-478-468-766-146 17 … 2 225-902-634-582-177-161-12. How does she do that? Yay It all comes down to the peculiar way our brains store memories. And perhaps no brain has taught us more about memory than this one. It belonged to a man named Henry Molaison When Henry was 27, he had brain surgery to treat epilepsy - and the surgeon removed this little piece of his brain. The surgeon noted that the procedure “resulted in no marked behavioral changes” “with the one exception of a very grave, recent memory loss” It was so severe, it prevented Henry from navigating his own house and recognizing his doctors But Henry still had other types of memory: habits that don’t require conscious thought - like how to ride a bike - so called “implicit memories” He also kept some conscious or “explicit” memories - he discussed historical events with his doctor in this recording from the early 90s: Milner: What happened in 1929? Molaison: The stock market crashed. Milner: It sure did."" That’s an example of “semantic memory” - facts, dates, numbers, words - the kinds of things memory athletes memorize. ""The real damage was to Henry’s “episodic memory” - his memory for personal experiences. When his doctor asked “Do you know what you did yesterday,” he replied: Molaison: No, I don't. Milner: How about this morning? Molaison: I don't even remember that."" Without this one small part of his brain, Henry had trouble forming new memories. But that doesn’t mean memories are stored in one specific place … When you have an experience (say - performing at a recital) sensory information is processed in many different parts of your brain: The sound of the cello, the feeling of the strings under your fingers, the face of your friend in the audience the pang of stage fright And the part of the brain that pulls all these elements together - the part that Henry’s surgery badly damaged - is the medial temporal lobe, which includes an important structure called the hippocampus. When you relive that moment later, the medial temporal lobe helps combine those elements once again. Your life story is all the moments like this that you can relive. And this graph is the life story of a typical 70-year-old. There are lots of memories from the recent past, but as you move backward in time they start to fall off There are only a few memories from childhood - and nothing before around 3 But there’s this surprising bump in our teens and twenties PHELPS: When you're getting through high school you're having a lot of momentous occasions in that stage of your life. PHELPS: when we think about our life stories those change moments are the ones that stand out as the ones that kind of define us … and define our lives going forward. Some people have more memories than others. And you can improve your memory by just living a healthier and more active life I try to like not drink as much sleep a lot and eat well. the one thing that I've seen in every single study that's like this is going to work is honestly meditation Undergraduates were able to increase their score on the verbal GRE’s from 460 to 520 just by taking a mindfulness meditation class -- probably because meditation improves focus, and focus improves memory. And when it comes to personal experiences -- there are certain features that make us remember some better than others. First, emotion. If you show a person a string of faces, they’ll remember the most emotional ones best When we have an emotional experience our amygdala the emotional center of the brain which sits right next to the hippocampus actually up regulates the hippocampus and allows it to form more detailed and stronger memory. one of the things we want to do after 9/11 was look into the brains of individuals who were in New York that day about half the people were on average around midtown and the other half the people were … much closer to the World Trade Center that day. Three years after the attacks, they asked those people to remember their experiences. the individuals that were closer to the World Trade Center that day the 9/11 memories were more vivid we saw more activity in the amygdala Memories are also connected to a sense of place. one of the things we know from our study of 9/11 memories is that the thing that people were most consistent about was where they were. I had just gotten home from gym class- -I was living in London at the time- -in New Smyrna Beach, Florida- -the Upper East Side- So we think you know place has a particularly strong role in memory ... and if you actually look in the hippocampus there seem to be cells that are specifically responsive to time and place Here’s a representation of these “place cells” in the hippocampus of one particular rat ""And here’s a video of that rat moving along a simple track -"" his head is in this green circle, and here’s his tail. Each place cell is associated with a particular location along the track - and these cells have been color coded by scientists When the rat is at the start of the maze, this green place cell fires but as it moves along, a different cell is activated. And then another and another. When the rat pauses, the cells fire in rapid succession as he recalls his route. London cabbies must navigate their own rat maze To get their licenses, they have to pass a century-old test called simply “The Knowledge.” They spend years memorizing London’s 25,000 streets. Scientists scanned the brains of would-be cabbies before and after this process In the brains of people who didn’t end up getting their licenses - the size of the hippocampus didn’t really change. But those who passed? Interestingly, their hippocampi actually grew. Finally, memories can be strengthened by story. Our brains pay much closer attention to information when it’s in the form of a narrative. In one study, 24 people were asked to memorize 12 lists of 10 words. Half the people studied and rehearsed the lists - and they remembered - on average - 13% of the words The other half wove the words into stories of their own invention … and they remembered 93%. PHELPS: the more that you can associate things you want to remember with structures you already have in your mind the easier is going to be to remember. you know you're creating a narrative. ADDIS :When we go to retrieve that memory we have almost many multiple ways of getting into that memory. Story, place and emotion are the foundation of some of our strongest memories - and those same features can be hijacked to help you, say ... memorize 500 random digits. YANJAA: Yes let's do it. Starting with the first three digits, she converts numbers into sounds using her own personal code. YANJAA: So five is an S three is an A as we have in swedish. And nine is a G because just because of the shapes. Yeah. So then it's basically like you're reading something instead of looking at all these numbers So 5 3 9 is SAG. And the next triplet, 166, becomes TBB YANJAA: and I think of the kind of Middle Eastern dish of tabbouleh She pairs the two words to create a striking scenario YANJAA: this saggy half naked person is covered in like tabbouleh rice and because it's disgusting I remember it more Anything that has like visceral really very emotional things your brain is like “oh” She translates the rest of the digits in the same way. YANJAA: Gimli from Lord of the Rings -- he is running for office Rami Malek buying boots my spleen turns into the Louvre Next, Yanjaa harnesses the power of place with an ancient technique called “the memory palace” She imagines herself walking through a neighborhood she knows well - adding surreal imagery along the route. YANJAA: It helps in putting very random abstract things in order when you attach it to something you already know YANJAA : So I come out of the High Street Metro So a saggy skinned person is just covered in tabbouleh and coming out of the High Street subway And a little further on: YANJAA: In that tunnel - 478 that's a reef, and 468 that's ravioli. So it's a tunnel that's now a reef and full of ravioli. YANJAA: on the carousel we’ll have like a big like alpaca llama and it's like eating like this tube of like melted cheese That dull list of numbers became an epic travelogue full of surprising images that she could revisit later Memory athletes aren’t necessarily smarter than everyday people - and they don’t have bigger brains But they change the connections within their brains by training with techniques like the memory palace YANJAA: we are more wired to remember that than to remember random sets of digits in general we're like emotional and visual learners. And storytellers Only a dozen people in the world have memorized more than 20,000 digits of pi but lots and lots of people have played Hamlet, and memorized all his lines OLIVIER: “Words words words” which contain nearly 50,000 letters OLIVIER: “Remember thee! Ay, thou poor ghost while memory holds a seat in this distracted globe” But that’s not the full story Some of the same things that strengthen our memories can also warp them ADDIS typically with emotional memories we tend to remember the central aspects are our attention kind of zooms in on the core of that experience. So we might forget some of the peripheral details like perhaps what a perpetrator was wearing but we'll remember the gun Emotional 9/11 memories are just as inaccurate as everyday memories - they both deteriorate at the same rate. PHELPS:What was different is that people were highly confident their memories for the 9/11 were correct. Memories aren’t high fidelity recordings that we store away. They’re more like live performances created with input from different parts of the brain -- in the present moment ADDIS We can't remember every single detail of every experience. And so we use pre-existing knowledge such as semantic memory or facts that we have or our pre-existing biases and beliefs to fill in those gaps That could explain the errors in Melanie’s memory of 9/11 my mom worked in New York City growing up all my life. So of course she was in the city And after 9/11 maybe Melanie saw billowing smoke on TV - and that’s how it entered her memory. ADDIS So, the fact that we reconstruct our episodic memory so we piece them back together means that our episodic memories are actually very flexible Scientists have been able to exploit this flexibility to plant false childhood memories of being left at a shopping mall, taking a hot air balloon ride, even having tea with Prince Charles. In one study, young adults were asked to try and remember a crime they had supposedly committed in their teens. Even though these crimes were completely fake - made up by the researchers, after a couple of interviews full of leading questions, 70% of the subjects accepted that they had committed those crimes and many came up with rich, detailed memories that were completely false. PHELPS: one of the places where this plays out you know that that is unfortunate is things like eyewitness identifications ""THOMPSON:They said we’re going to take you into a room, we’re going to have seven men, … if I saw the suspect I was to write a number on his piece of paper and hand it over to the detective"" More than two decades after she was raped, Jennifer Thompson appeared television with the man she had identified as her attacker. THOMPSON: After I picked out Ronald Cotton’s photograph that’s when they said to me we thought that was him. PHELPS: we can boost the confidence in a false memory by confirming it or by at least repeating it multiple times THOMPSON: By now Ronald’s image had completely contaminated so to speak the original memory of that night - and so the face of my rapist had become Ronald Cotton - so much so that seeing the actual perpetrator, right there, I didn’t have one memory of it. Years after Ronald was imprisoned, DNA evidence proved that Jennifer had been raped by another man. In the US, DNA has helped overturn hundreds of convictions, and 70% of those involved eyewitness testimony. It’s not just our memories of crimes that can become “contaminated” - it’s the memories that tell us who we are and where we came from. Researchers interviewed a group of 14 year-olds and then, decades later, asked them to recall their teenage years - what their relationship with their parents was like; how they had felt about sex and religion; what activities they had enjoyed. Their memories, it turned out, were “uniformly poor” - for most memories, “no better than chance.” ADDIS: So this poses the question: Why would we have a memory system that is so unreliable and error prone if it was designed to remember the past? That’s the big question. And once again, those recordings of Henry Molaison point to a possible answer Dr. CORKIN: What do you think you'll do tomorrow? H.M.: Whatever is beneficial. Henry often struggled to answer questions like these - it seemed to scientists that he hadn’t just lost his past - he could no longer imagine the future. ""Three decades after H.M.’s surgery, another patient’s medial temporal lobe was severely damaged in a motorcycle accident. In this interview from 1988, the patient was asked by his doctor: TULVING: “Do you feel hopeful about the future?” COCHRANE: … … I guess so. I don’t really think much about the future. TULVING: You don’t think much about the future Well, we may have to come back to that later on. That same patient once described thinking about the future as being asked to “find a chair” in an empty room. The future and the past seemed to be somehow linked in the mind. ADDIS: we decided to put people into the scanner and have them remember past experiences and imagined future experiences. And we really didn't know what to expect When people remembered, a particular network lit up. And ... ADDIS: that same network was engaged pretty much identically when people were having to imagine future events When we let our minds wander, we switch back and forth all the time -- remembering and imagining. Our mind is a time machine. In Lewis Caroll’s “Through The Looking Glass” the Queen of Hearts remarks “It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards."" It turns out, she’s right. The same machinery that brings all those pieces together to relive the past - can bring some of those pieces together with other pieces to simulate possible futures. Now, the flexibility that leads us to remember things that never happened that undermines the justice system that corrupts our most vivid memories … It can start to look like a superpower - the key to our success as a species ADDIS: it allows us to troubleshoot upcoming experiences, to think through the ways in which events might unfold, potential obstacles that might come up in the ways in which we might deal with those obstacles. And some scientists say this simulation engine between your ears does something even more profound: it weaves together memories of the past and dreams of the future to create your sense of self. "
543,Science & Technology,28,UCLXo7UDZvByw2ixzpQCufnA | Vox,pAoEHR4aW8I,"On April 4th, 2017, a privileged group of telescopes on mountains across the planet switched on at the same time. For the next week they danced in unison, collecting radio waves dispatched from the center of our Milky Way galaxy and from the galaxy m87. Together they make up the event horizon telescope, a global project to capture the first ever picture of a black hole. That's right. Ever since physicists first conceived of black holes centuries ago, every image of one from our textbooks and our space agencies, they're all illustrations. Until now. We are delighted to be able to report to you today that we have seen what we thought was unseeable. For centuries, physicists have theorized that an object with enough mass and density could trap even light in its gravitational field, just as you have to travel faster to leave Earth than you do to leave the Moon, there could be a place where you'd have to travel faster than the speed of light to escape. And nothing moves faster than light. The math from Einstein's theory of general relativity describes an area completely invisible to us within a boundary called the ""event horizon,"" and at the center of that black hole is a singularity, a point of infinite density which is where physics as we know it breaks down. They showed up in the math long ago and they kept reappearing and they sort of persistently would not go away, but Einstein always thought that there must be some physical mechanism that prevents stars from collapsing to an infinitely small point, which is actually pretty reasonable. I mean, because it sounds insane. Eventually scientists began to see things that only made sense if black holes were real, like the orbits of these stars around the centre of the Milky Way galaxy. You see these stars just slingshotting around an invisible point and a black hole is the most likely explanation for putting that amount of mass in that small space, for something that's completely dark. We can also see the glowing material that spirals around black holes: Friction heats this matter up tens of millions of degrees and anything that hot emits X-rays that we can detect with telescopes that orbit above Earth's atmosphere. This is a pair of galaxies that pass through each other. There are at least nine suspected black holes here, but you can only see them when you look at the X-ray layer. These dots are X-ray sources linked to suspected supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies three to ten billion light-years away. And that's just from this small patch of sky. Some super massive black holes also feature gigantic jets of particles, seen here in radio wave data from the galaxy m87, which has a much bigger black hole than the one in the center of the Milky Way. No other known source of energy could power these things and nothing we know of besides two black holes colliding could have produced the gravitational waves we detected in 2015. Scientists think there are black holes large and small all over the universe. We can see their fingerprints but we didn't have the mug shot. Directly imaging a black hole has been impossible because they're either too small, too far away, or both. Sagittarius A*, the black hole at the center of our galaxy has the mass of four million Suns, but it would fit inside the orbit of Mercury. Imaging it from Earth is like taking a picture of a DVD on the surface of the Moon, with huge clouds of dust and gas in between. So many things had to go right for this image to exist, so the first thing that has to happen is there has to be some slice of light that travels all the way from the edge of the black hole without getting knocked off course or absorbed by any of the gas or anything in between, and then it also has to make it through the Earth's atmosphere which a lot of frequencies of light don't. They landed on a wavelength of 1.3 millimeters at the high frequency end of the radio spectrum. With that wavelength and with eight observatories across the world, the event horizon telescope had a chance at seeing a black hole, as long as the weather cooperated. You have to have clear weather in all of those places at a time when the Earth is oriented in such a way that all of those telescopes can see the black hole simultaneously. They can really only observe once a year. There was so much data involved that it had to be flown on airplanes. They waited six months for the hard drives to arrive from the South Pole, which closes during winter time. This multi-telescope method is called ""Very long baseline interferometry,"" it correlates timestamped data from distant telescopes to boost the signal and quiet the noise. Each pairing of telescopes contributes a piece of the puzzle, but the image doesn't just pop out after that. They had four groups working for months to generate the image that best represents the data. Each group was working individually and like in isolation from the other groups, working with the same data, to see that each group came up with the same image or not. And the result of all that work is this. The bright parts are the matter and lights swirling around the black hole and it's brighter on the side that's moving toward us. And the dark part is the black hole's shadow, which includes the event horizon plus a region where light could escape, but doesn't. The size and shape of the shadow appear to confirm the theory of general relativity. Today, general relativity has passed another crucial test, this one spanning from horizons to the stars. Humanity's first image of a black hole isn't crisp and beautiful like the illustrations or the movie Interstellar. It's better. The picture we see this week is made of scraps and bits of light that's been traveling across the universe and collected by these, you know, aluminum dishes on top of mountaintops and then combined in a supercomputer to make this image. So that's why it's real. "
