TRELS Experience Update Dec 19 - March 15th 

 - Thoughts so far: Being part of Professor Xia's research project has been an exciting yet intimidating time so far.
   I've met the 2 team members since joining the TRELS program under Professor Xia: 4th year cog sci student Krystal Zeng
   and 1st year PHD cog sci student Hui Xin Ng. Being a 2nd year, I can see the vast gap in knowledge between 
   me and the upperclassmen team members; however, they've been very understanding of my position and have taught me 
   much about the intricacies of aiding someone's research.

 - Research projects requires punctuality and being consistent with the timeline your professor sets. Having come from 
   a very time fluid internship previously, I've struggled to balance the quarter and my position. So I give my apologies
   to my upperclassmen and Professor Xia. I believe Spring Quarter will offer much more promise for me to demonstrate 
   my ability to help and learn as there won't be personal issues that inhibit my academics and research.
